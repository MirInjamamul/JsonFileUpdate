If pivotal technological and cost breakthroughs are\n> achieved, cultured meat could be one solution that helps support\n> diversified, sustainable, and healthy diets for a growing world population \u2013\n> and will have a trillion-dollar market potential.\n\nWim Klop, Vice President DSM Biotechnology Center, says, \u2018\u2019Protein is an\nessential part of a balanced diet and vital for good health. Yet its\nproduction has a big environmental footprint. With the world population\nexpected to grow to 10 billion people by 2050, a wide variety of solutions for\nmore sustainable proteins will be needed. Cultivated meat is one of those\npromising, innovative protein solutions in which DSM invests. Our commitment\ngoes way beyond investing in Meatable through DSM Venturing. With this joint\ndevelopment agreement DSM will contribute its unique competencies in\nbiotechnology, such as fermentation, analysis and production scale-up to help\nmake the science of cultivated meat a reality.\u201d\n\nIn addition to focusing on the cost-effective production of growth media, DSM\nand Meatable will focus on the development of meat-like taste and texture of\nthe final product, which are important factors influencing the purchase\ndecision of consumers.\n\n\u201cWith traditional animal farming alone, we will not be able to meet the\ngrowing demand for meat worldwide; we need breakthrough solutions. Cultivated\nmeat has the potential to provide the growing world population with the\nprotein source many people love \u2013 meat \u2013 using an efficient and sustainable\nproduction process that respects animal health and welfare,\u201d says [Krijn de\nNood, CEO and co-founder of\nMeatable](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meatable.com%2F%23whoweare&esheet=52490306&newsitemid=20210913005244&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=Krijn+de+Nood%2C+CEO+and+co-\nfounder+of+Meatable&index=4&md5=0565b67737b47318913f64926fd8847c). \u201cJoining\nforces with DSM, a global leader in biotechnology, will accelerate our\nresearch and development trajectory significantly.

But, of course, metal\nweighs more than plastic. The Leica SL 50mm f2 Summicron is designed to be a\nlighter, more compact alternative to the Leica SL 50mm f1.4 Summilux. Of\ncourse, the term lighter is relative; I wouldn\u2019t call a metal lens a\nlightweight. Yet it\u2019s still lighter than the Panasonic Lumix S Pro 50mm f1.4\nand Leica\u2019s f1.4, and feels almost perfectly balanced with the Panasonic S5\nbody.\n\nWhile the design isn\u2019t as heavy, the lens still produces some of the same\nbeautiful color and sharpness. I spent two weeks shooting portraits,\nlifestyle, and landscape photos with the Leica 50mm f2 to see what this lens\ncan capture.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n__\n\n  * Too Long, Didn\u2019t Read\n  * Pros and Cons\n    * Pros\n    * Cons\n  * Gear Used\n  * Innovations\n  * Tech Specs\n  * Ergonomics\n  * Build Quality\n  * Autofocus\n  * Ease of Use\n  * Image Quality\n    * Bokeh\n    * Sharpness\n    * Lens Character\n    * Color Rendering\n  * Extra Image Samples\n    * Edited\n    * Unedited\n  * Conclusions\n    * Likes\n    * Dislikes\n\n## Too Long, Didn\u2019t Read\n\nThe Leica SL 50mm f2 Summicron is a well-built, metal-body lens that\u2019s both\nsimple and beautiful to use. The images are spectacular, and they achieve a\nhappy medium between eliminating distortion and eliminating character. But,\n[it\u2019s pricey](https://www.amazon.com/Leica-APO-SUMMICRON-SL-50mm-Aspherical-\nLens/dp/B083W2HXBZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Leica+50mm+f2+sl&qid=1631278857&sr=8-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=thephobl-20&linkId=0d769ddf19fade247deab5cded1f9cd4&language=en_US)\nand, like we noted with the f1.4 Summilux, the autofocus isn\u2019t perfect.\n\n## Pros and Cons\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-7495-770x513.jpg)\n\n### Pros\n\n  * Beautiful metal build\n  * Excellent mix of quality and character\n  * Nice contrast\n  * Lovely bokeh\n  * Simple design\n  * About 25% lighter than the Leica 50mm f1.2 SL\n\n### Cons\n\n  * [Expensive](https://www.amazon.com/Leica-APO-SUMMICRON-SL-50mm-Aspherical-Lens/dp/B083W2HXBZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Leica+50mm+f2+sl&qid=1631278857&sr=8-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=thephobl-20&linkId=0d769ddf19fade247deab5cded1f9cd4&language=en_US)\n  * L system autofocus still lags behind\n  * Slight corner softness\n\n## Gear Used\n\nI used the Leica 50mm f2 SL with the [Panasonic\nS5](https://www.thephoblographer.com/2020/10/29/their-best-camera-yet-but-a-\nways-to-go-panasonic-s5-review/). I kept it simple and didn\u2019t use a hood. And\nI paired it with a WANDRD wrist strap.\n\n## Innovations\n\nThe 50mm f2 is really meant as a lighter alternative to [Leica\u2019s 50mm f1.4\nSummilux](https://www.thephoblographer.com/2020/04/14/review-leica-\nsl-50mm-f1-4-summilux-the-best-l-mount-portrait-lens/). What\u2019s unique with the\nway Leica handles these lighter f2 lenses is that they still focus on\neliminating aberrations and other distortions. This is not the low-quality\nversion of the f1.4, just a low bokeh version. Otherwise, the innovation here\nis what\u2019s innovative about Leica\u2019s other lenses -- durable all-metal design.\n\n## Tech Specs\n\nLeica [lists these tech specs](https://us.leica-camera.com/Photography/Leica-\nSL/SL-Lenses/Prime-Lenses/APO-Summicron-SL-50) for the 50mm Summicron:\n\n  * Field angle (diagonal, horizontal, vertical): 47.2\u00b0/40\u00b0/27.3\u00b0\n  * Number of lenses/groups: 12/10\n  * Number of asph. surfaces / lenses: 4/3\n  * Entrance pupil position: 63.2 mm at \u221e\n  * Working range: \u221e to 0.35 m\n  * Smallest object field: 120 x 180 mm\n  * Largest reproduction ratio 1:5\n  * Aperture Setting/function: Electronically controlled aperture, set using turn/push wheel on camera, including half and third values\n  * Aperture setting range: 2 - 22\n  * Lowest value: 22\n  * Bayonet/sensor format: L-Mount, full-frame 35 mm format\n  * Filter mount: E67\n  * Length to bayonet mount: 102 mm\n  * Largest diameter: 73 mm\n  * Weight: 740 g (27.87 oz.)\n\n## Ergonomics\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-7478-770x513.jpg)\n\nThe Leica 50mm f2 SL has a design that I\u2019ve come to expect from the German\ncompany. The all-metal design makes the lens feel like it\u2019s been around since\nwell before the Leica SL. Yet, at the same time, the metal build makes this\nlens feel like a tank.\n\nLeica says the 50mm f2 SL is designed to be smaller and lighter than the\nbrighter nifty fifty. Now, no one buys an all-metal Leica because it\u2019s tiny\nand light. But, comparatively speaking, the 50mm f2 SL isn\u2019t quite as much of\na beast as the 50mm f1.2 SL. It\u2019s about 25 percent lighter, weighing about 1.7\npounds, and 18 percent shorter at a touch over four inches. It's also lighter\nthan the [Panasonic 50mm f1.4 Lumix S\nPro](https://www.thephoblographer.com/2020/02/27/review-\npanasonic-50mm-f1-4-lumix-s-pro-a-beauty-of-the-l-mount/). There are lighter\nand smaller nifty fifties out there, but the Leica SL 50mm f2 is more of a\nhappy medium between a plastic lens and a beastly bright metal one. It\nbalances well mounted on the front of the Panasonic S5, feeling only slightly\nfront-heavy.\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-7501-770x513.jpg)\n\nThe lens has just a single control -- a large manual focus ring. I didn\u2019t mind\nthe simplified controls, since the S5 has a focus mode switch that's as simple\nto use as one on a lens. But, that\u2019s not the case with every L mount camera\nbody. The ring turns smoothly. It\u2019s a slower, stiffer turn that allows for\nmore precise manual focusing adjustments.\n\nThe front of the lens has a smaller 67mm filter size. Brighter lenses tend to\nhave larger front optics and less of an edge at the front. Except for a small\nbump out from the mount, the lens is the same diameter the whole way through.\n\n## Build Quality\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-7466-770x513.jpg)\n\nThere\u2019s really nothing like an all-metal lens. The Leica 50mm f2 SL is built\nlike a tank. It feels every bit the luxury lens that it is. The focus ring\nturns smoothly and slowly.\n\nThe lens is also weather-sealed. I splashed the lens with a few handfuls of\nwater. The lens and camera kept on shooting and I didn\u2019t find any moisture in\nthe mount. The lens also kept sand out when I shot at the beach. (The camera\nand lens did get some dust inside from outdoor lens swaps.)\n\n## Autofocus\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001016-770x513.jpg)\n\nThe Leica 50mm f2 SL uses dual drive autofocus motors. The motors are quiet\nenough not to draw attention to the photographer. The autofocus is generally\nfast, but not quite as robust as Canon\u2019s or Sony\u2019s. The lens is fast enough\nfor portraits and freezing subjects at a walk but slows down when working at\nclose range.\n\nThe autofocus had a near-perfect hit rate with moving subjects several feet\naway. Closer to the lens\u2019 1.15-foot limit, the opposite was true and most of\nthe shots were soft. The 1.15 autofocus limit is true for stationary subjects,\nbut with moving subjects, you\u2019ll want them to be at least three feet from the\nlens. This is expected, especially when working with subjects that are heading\nstraight towards the camera.\n\nFor portraits, I had a few soft shots of a squirmy toddler. Photographing a\nteenager, that miss rate dropped dramatically. Occasionally, you\u2019ll get a shot\nthat\u2019s not quite on the eyes, but it\u2019s not bad.\n\nI did have some trouble locking focus when shooting backlit, particularly with\ndarker subjects like the chocolate-brown fur on my dog. However, when I\nswapped out the Leica 50mm f2 for the S5\u2019s kit lens and shot the same exact\nscene, the autofocus still had trouble. That lead me to believe that it's the\nS5\u2019s autofocus that has a lower hit rate with backlighting.\n\n## Ease of Use\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001238-770x513.jpg)\n\nDon\u2019t let the label fool you -- the Leica SL 50mm f2 is as simple as mount and\nshoot. While the price point may put it out of a beginner\u2019s reach, the\ncontrols will not. There\u2019s just the single focus ring. That means there are no\nextra controls to learn.\n\nSometimes, a lack of controls makes it slower for advanced photographers, but\nI didn\u2019t find that to be the case here. There\u2019s an S to C to MF control right\non the S5 body, so an M to AF switch would have been redundant. That may not\nbe the case with the Leica SL2, however. The lens also doesn\u2019t have a depth of\nfield scale, but with the focus peaking on the camera body, I didn\u2019t miss it.\n\n## Image Quality\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001441-770x513.jpg)\n\nWhile it\u2019s not the brightest nifty fifty for L mount shooters, the Leica 50mm\nf2 SL still delivers beautiful bokeh, solid contrast, and minimal distortion.\nThe lens offers an ideal balance of the things modern photographers are\nlooking for without eliminating the potential for a bit of character. The lens\nmixes minimal distortion and good sharpness with the potential for some flare.\n\n### Bokeh\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001118-770x513.jpg)\n\nAt f2, subjects still pop from the background. When focused on the eyes, the\nfalloff isn\u2019t as quick as an f1.2. It\u2019s easier to get both the eyes and\neyelashes in focus, but the nose doesn\u2019t blur as quickly. However, the\nbackground still has great separation from the subject. Is it going to be as\ngreat as an f1.2? No, but I don\u2019t think anyone is going to look at these\nphotos and whisper, \" _tsk tsk, should have used the f1.2._ \"\n\nBokeh balls are soft, with no hard edges. Most of the bokeh this lens captured\nwas also smooth throughout, but you may occasionally find a bit of soap bubble\nbokeh from particularly harsh light sources. Bokeh is circular at the center,\nbut takes on a cat-eye shape towards the edges. If you have a lot of bokeh,\nthe mix of circles and cats eyes will give the background a swirly look.\n\n### Sharpness\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001465-770x513.jpg)\n\nThis lens is tack sharp at the center, even shooting wide open. The very\ncorners are slightly soft but sharpen quickly at f4. You won\u2019t notice that\ncorner softness in most shots -- and it will, in fact, draw the eye to the\ncenter. It's likely part of that swirly bokeh as well. But, if you want to\ntake a shot with the subject in the corner, you may want to set the aperture\nto f4 or more.\n\n### Lens Character\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001178-770x513.jpg)\n\nThe Leica 50mm f2 SL eliminates the annoying distortion while leaving just\nenough for some character. I couldn\u2019t spot my two least favorite character\nflaws -- barrel distortion and chromatic aberration. Lines still appeared\nstraight. And, even viewing high contrast backlit subjects, I couldn\u2019t pick up\nmuch aberration.\n\nThe flare coming from this 50mm builds character. Shooting at golden hour, the\nlens captures some beautiful soft sun. When positioned just right, the lens\nwill grab some nice streaks of light. The 50mm can also grab some circular\nlens flare as well, but even shooting without a hood, I could eliminate the\nflare by adjusting my angle just slightly.\n\nThe Leica 50mm f2 SL has this ideal mix of modern image quality and long-\nstanding character. Flaws like aberration and barrel distortion are well\ncontrolled. Yet, you can still get some soft, streaky light and spots of\nflare.\n\n### Color Rendering\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001325-770x513.jpg)\n\nThe colors captured on the Leica 50mm f2 SL are beautiful. Colors were largely\naccurate, with a few colors that seemed to capture slightly dark. I got a lot\nof great contrast shooting mid-day, and softer, lighter colors working backlit\nat golden hour.\n\n## Extra Image Samples\n\n_From day one, The Phoblographer has been huge on transparency with our\naudience. Nothing from this review is sponsored. Further, lots of folks will\npost reviews that show lots of editing in the photos. The problem then becomes\nthat anyone and everyone can do the same thing. They 're not showing what the\nlens can do. So we have a section in our Extra Image Samples area to show\nedited and unedited photos. From this, you can make a decision for yourself._\n\n### Edited\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1000965-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1000963-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1000958-770x1155.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1000971-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1000978-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001226-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001224-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001353-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001020-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001049-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001084-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001046-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001544-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001586-770x513.jpg)\n\n### Unedited\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001012-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001176-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001198-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001237-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001246-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001312-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001402-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001408-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001530-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001522-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001537-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001556-770x513.jpg)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hillary-\nGrigonis-The-Phoblographer-Leica-50mm-f2-SL-review-1001578-770x513.jpg)\n\n## Conclusions\n\n### Likes\n\n  * The metal design is both beautiful and durable.\n  * Distortion is well-controlled, yet there\u2019s still some character from flare and bokeh.\n  * The contrast and bokeh still look great.\n  * The design is easy to use.\n  * It\u2019s lighter than Leica\u2019s and Panasonic\u2019s 50mm f1.4.\n\n### Dislikes\n\n  * It\u2019s $5,095.\n  * The autofocus is just okay.\n  * There\u2019s some minor corner softness.\n\nThe Leica SL 50mm f2 Summicron is a well-balanced lens. It doesn\u2019t make the\ncamera body too front-heavy, and it balances image quality with character-\nbuilding bokeh and flare. The metal design withstood both water and sand. Even\nas an f2, it delivers some beautiful bokeh with great background separation.\n\nBut, the autofocus is just okay. This is in part the L mount system. We noted\nin our S5 review that the body doesn\u2019t focus as well with Leica lenses as it\ndoes with Panasonic glass. It will capture a lot of sharp shots, but it\u2019s not\nquite as fast as Canon or Sony systems.\n\nThe other downside is the price. A $5,095 price point is expected on a Leica,\nbut the f1.4 is $5,995. $900 on any other lens system would be a big price\ndifference. But, it\u2019s only a 15 percent price drop to lose a stop of light and\nroughly half a pound.\n\nOverall, the Leica SL 50mm f2 Summicron delivers excellent images inside a\nbeautiful lens. I\u2019m giving this lens four out of five stars.\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2014/04/Phoblographer-4-Star-rating.jpg)\n\n[Hillary Grigonis](https://www.thephoblographer.com/author/hillarygrigonis/)\n\n![](https://www.thephoblographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_65681.jpg)\n\n##  [Hillary\nGrigonis](https://www.thephoblographer.com/author/hillarygrigonis/)\n\nHillary K.

Anniversary\nstream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5kPYcGaDPo), Yostar revealed that\nCompile Heart has started working on a new _Azur Lane_ spin-off game for\nconsoles. This will be the franchise's second console game after the same\ncompany previously released _Azur Lane: Crosswave_.\n\nYostar did not provide a title or artwork for the new console game. The only\nthing it revealed was an image with some text, including a Compile Heart\ncopyright at the bottom right corner.\n\n[![Teaser for new Azur Lane console game](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2021/09/Teaser-for-new-Azur-Lane-console-game.jpg)![Teaser for\nnew Azur Lane console\ngame](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20800%20450%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2021/09/Teaser-for-new-Azur-Lane-console-game.jpg)\n\n\n\nWe have translated the text on the teaser image as follows:\n\n> \"You cannot become a Commander.\"\n>\n> Primal Ego Projection Complete.\n>\n>  _Azur Lane_ new spin-off consumer game project begins.\n\nCompile Heart had previously worked on _Azur Lane: Crosswave_ , the\nfranchise's first-ever console game. It featured IJN Suruga and Shimakaze, two\nnew shipgirls that had not been present in the original mobile game at that\ntime.\n\nManjuu and Yongshi eventually added Suruga to the mobile game through the\n\"Swirling Cherry Blossoms\" event around the 2020 New Year. Shimakaze did not\nfollow suit until much later, when the developers feature her as an Ultra Rare\nship girl in the [\"Upon the Shimmering Blue\"](https://www.siliconera.com/azur-\nlane-shimakaze-event-will-mark-japanese-4th-anniversary/) event around the\nJapanese 4th Anniversary in September 2021.\n\n _Azur Lane: Crosswave_ is currently available on PlayStation 4, PC, and\nNintendo Switch. Compile Heart released it first on PlayStation 4 in August\n2019. The company then brought the game to PC in February 2020 and Nintendo\nSwitch in September 2020. Idea Factory International has released the [English\nlocalized versions](https://www.siliconera.com/azur-lane-crosswave-switch-\nversion-will-arrive-after-valentines-day/) on all aforementioned platforms.\n\n  *  __Posted in\n  * [News](https://www.siliconera.com/category/news/)\n\n  *  __Tagged with\n  * [Azur Lane](https://www.siliconera.com/tag/azur-lane/)\n  * [Azur Lane: Crosswave](https://www.siliconera.com/tag/azur-lane-crosswave/)\n  * [Compile Heart](https://www.siliconera.com/tag/compile-heart/)\n  * [Japan](https://www.siliconera.com/tag/japan/)\n  * [Manjuu](https://www.siliconera.com/tag/manjuu/)\n\n  * [ __Share](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.siliconera.com%2Fcompile-heart-working-on-a-new-azur-lane-console-game%2F \"Share on Facebook\")\n  * [ __Tweet](http://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.siliconera.com%2Fcompile-heart-working-on-a-new-azur-lane-console-game%2F&text=Compile%20Heart%20Working%20on%20a%20New%20Azur%20Lane%20Console%20Game \"Share on Twitter\")\n  * [ __Pin](javascript:void\\(\\(function\\(\\)%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement\\('script'\\);e.setAttribute\\('type','text/javascript'\\);e.setAttribute\\('charset','UTF-8'\\);e.setAttribute\\('src','http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r='+Math.random\\(\\)*99999999\\);document.body.appendChild\\(e\\)%7D\\)\\(\\)\\); \"Share on Pinterest\")\n  * [ __Share](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.siliconera.com%2Fcompile-heart-working-on-a-new-azur-lane-console-game%2F \"Share on Linkedin\")\n\n__0\n\n![Kite Stenbuck](https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BK-\nEmblemNew-180x180.png)![Kite\nStenbuck](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20180%20180%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n[Kite Stenbuck](https://www.siliconera.com/author/blackkitesiliconera/ \"Posts\nby Kite Stenbuck\")\n\nAn avid gamer who learned the Japanese language mostly by playing Japanese\ngames.

( \"New Gold\" or the\n\"Company\")** (TSX: NGD) and (NYSE American: NGD) provides an update to its\n2021 operational outlook for the Rainy River Mine and the consolidated\noperational outlook. All amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise\nindicated.\n\nIn early August, the Company indicated that July production at Rainy River was\nprimarily from the eastern area of the ODM zone (\"East Lobe\") and the realized\ngold grade from this area was below the modeled gold grade in this period.\nThis trend continued in August. Over both July and August, the modeled East\nLobe high and medium grade ore negatively reconciled to ounces mined, leading\nto a total of approximately 20,000 lower gold ounces produced during this\nperiod. The Company has since followed up with additional reverse circulation\ndrilling and globally, all areas outside of the East Lobe, continues to\nreconcile well where mining has occurred or is about to occur, and are\nconsistent with historical results. The East Lobe represents approximately 35%\nof planned production for the remaining period of September to December 2021.\nAs a result of the variance experienced in the East Lobe, Rainy River's gold\nequivalent1 production for 2021 is now expected to be between 240,000 and\n255,000 ounces.\n\nThe Company continues reverse circulation drilling in the East Lobe and the\nunderstanding of the mineralization is improving, however, additional drilling\nis required to refine the block model and improve its predictability. The\nCompany is advancing an underground optimization study for Rainy River, with\ncompletion anticipated by year-end, and results would be incorporated into the\nyear-end Mineral Reserve and Resource and life of mine update.\n\n_\" While the reduction in our near-term guidance at Rainy River is\nunfortunate, I remain confident the mine has reached an inflection point, as\nevidenced by the free cash flow generated in the second quarter and the mine\nis on track to deliver an improved second half of the year\", stated Renaud\nAdams, President & CEO. We continue to seek ways to further optimize our costs\nand capital profiles, and with the underground growth potential currently\nbeing evaluated, Rainy River is expected to be a meaningful contributor of\nfree cash flow in our portfolio going forward.\" _\n\nAs a result of the Rainy River revisions, consolidated gold equivalent1\nproduction for 2021 is now expected to be between 405,000 and 450,000 ounces.\nAnnual consolidated copper production guidance remains unchanged at 56 to 66\nmillion pounds. New Gold expects its consolidated 2021 all-in sustaining costs\nto be between $1,415 to $1,495 per gold eq. ounce2, and total cash costs to be\nbetween $960 to $1,030 per gold eq. ounce2.

Total gold eq. ounces include silver and copper produced/sold converted to\na gold eq. based on a ratio of $1,800 per gold ounce, $25.00 per silver ounce\nand $3.50 per copper pound used for 2021 guidance estimates. All copper is\nproduced/sold by the New Afton Mine. Gold equivalent ounces guidance includes\napproximately 585,000 to 600,000 ounces of silver at Rainy River and\napproximately 250,000 to 270,000 ounces of silver at New Afton.\n\n2\\. \"Total cash costs\", \"all-in sustaining costs\", \"sustaining capital and\nsustaining leases\", \"growth capital\", \"cash generated from operations\", \"free\ncash flow\" and \"average realized gold/copper price per ounce/pound\" are all\nnon-GAAP financial performance measures that are used in this press release.\nThese measures do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore\nmay not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. For more\ninformation about these measures, why they are used by the Company, and a\nreconciliation to the most directly comparable measure under IFRS, see the\n\"Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures\" section of this news release.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures**\n\nTotal Cash Costs per Gold eq. Ounce\n\n\"Total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce\" is a non-GAAP financial\nperformance measure that is a common financial performance measure in the gold\nmining industry but does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and\ntherefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other\nissuers. New Gold reports total cash costs on a sales basis and not on a\nproduction basis. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional\nmeasures prepared in accordance with IFRS, this measure, along with sales, is\na key indicator of the Company's ability to generate operating earnings and\ncash flow from its mining operations. This measure allows investors to better\nevaluate corporate performance and the Company's ability to generate liquidity\nthrough operating cash flow to fund future capital exploration and working\ncapital needs.\n\nThis measure is intended to provide additional information only and should not\nbe considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance\nprepared in accordance with IFRS. This measure is not necessarily indicative\nof cash generated from operations under IFRS or operating costs presented\nunder IFRS.\n\nTotal cash cost figures are calculated in accordance with a standard developed\nby The Gold Institute, a worldwide association of suppliers of gold and gold\nproducts that ceased operations in 2002. Adoption of the standard is voluntary\nand the cost measures presented may not be comparable to other similarly\ntitled measures of other companies. Total cash costs include mine site\noperating costs such as mining, processing and administration costs,\nroyalties, production taxes, but are exclusive of amortization, reclamation,\ncapital and exploration costs. Total cash costs are then divided by gold\nequivalent ounces sold to arrive at the total cash costs per equivalent ounce\nsold.\n\nIn addition to gold the Company produces copper and silver. Gold equivalent\nounces of copper and silver produced or sold in a quarter are computed using a\nconsistent ratio of copper and silver prices to the gold price and multiplying\nthis ratio by the pounds of copper and silver ounces produced or sold during\nthat quarter.\n\nNotwithstanding the impact of copper and silver sales, as the Company is\nfocused on gold production, New Gold aims to assess the economic results of\nits operations in relation to gold, which is the primary driver of New Gold's\nbusiness. New Gold believes this metric is of interest to its investors, who\ninvest in the Company primarily as a gold mining business. To determine the\nrelevant costs associated with gold equivalent ounces, New Gold believes it is\nappropriate to reflect all operating costs incurred in its operations.\n\nAll-In Sustaining Costs per Gold eq. Ounce\n\n\"All-in sustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce\" is a non-GAAP financial\nperformance measure that does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and\ntherefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other\nissuers. New Gold calculates \"all-in sustaining costs per gold equivalent\nounce\" based on guidance announced by the World Gold Council (\"WGC\") in\nSeptember 2013. The WGC is a non-profit association of the world's leading\ngold mining companies established in 1987 to promote the use of gold to\nindustry, consumers and investors. The WGC is not a regulatory body and does\nnot have the authority to develop accounting standards or disclosure\nrequirements. The WGC has worked with its member companies to develop a\nmeasure that expands on IFRS measures to provide visibility into the economics\nof a gold mining company. Current IFRS measures used in the gold industry,\nsuch as operating expenses, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to\ndiscover, develop and sustain gold production. New Gold believes that \"all-in\nsustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce\" provides further transparency into\ncosts associated with producing gold and will assist analysts, investors, and\nother stakeholders of the Company in assessing its operating performance, its\nability to generate free cash flow from current operations and its overall\nvalue. In addition, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors uses\n\"all-in sustaining costs\", together with other measures, in its Company\nscorecard to set incentive compensation goals and assess performance.\n\n\"All-in sustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce\" is intended to provide\nadditional information only and does not have any standardized meaning under\nIFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other mining\ncompanies. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for\nmeasures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. The measure is not\nnecessarily indicative of cash flow from operations under IFRS or operating\ncosts presented under IFRS.\n\nNew Gold defines \"all-in sustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce\" as the\nsum of total cash costs, net capital expenditures that are sustaining in\nnature, corporate general and administrative costs, capitalized and expensed\nexploration that is sustaining in nature, lease payments that are sustaining\nin nature, and environmental reclamation costs, all divided by the total gold\nequivalent ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure. The definition of\nsustaining versus non-sustaining is similarly applied to capitalized and\nexpensed exploration costs and lease payments. Exploration costs and lease\npayments to develop new operations or that relate to major projects at\nexisting operations where these projects are expected to materially increase\nproduction are classified as non-sustaining and are excluded. Gold equivalent\nounces of copper and silver produced or sold in a quarter are computed using a\nconsistent ratio of copper and silver prices to the gold price and multiplying\nthis ratio by the pounds of copper and silver ounces produced or sold during\nthat quarter.\n\nCosts excluded from all-in sustaining costs are non-sustaining capital\nexpenditures, non-sustaining lease payments and exploration costs, financing\ncosts, tax expense, and transaction costs associated with mergers,\nacquisitions and divestitures, and any items that are deducted for the\npurposes of adjusted earnings.\n\nSustaining Capital and Sustaining Leases\n\n\"Sustaining capital\" and \"sustaining lease\" are non-GAAP financial performance\nmeasures that do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore\nmay not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. New Gold\ndefines \"sustaining capital\" as net capital expenditures that are intended to\nmaintain operation of its gold producing assets. Similarly, a \"sustaining\nlease\" is a lease payment that is sustaining in nature. To determine\n\"sustaining capital\" expenditures, New Gold uses cash flow related to mining\ninterests from its statement of cash flows and deducts any expenditures that\nare capital expenditures to develop new operations or capital expenditures\nrelated to major projects at existing operations where these projects will\nmaterially increase production. Management uses \"sustaining capital\" and\n\"sustaining lease\", to understand the aggregate net result of the drivers of\nall-in sustaining costs other than total cash costs. These measures are\nintended to provide additional information only and should not be considered\nin isolation or as substitutes for measures of performance prepared in\naccordance with IFRS.\n\nGrowth Capital __\n\n\"Growth capital\" is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that does not\nhave any standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable\nto similar measures presented by other issuers. New Gold considers non-\nsustaining capital costs to be \"growth capital\", which are capital\nexpenditures to develop new operations or capital expenditures related to\nmajor projects at existing operations where these projects will materially\nincrease production. To determine \"growth capital\" expenditures, New Gold uses\ncash flow related to mining interests from its statement of cash flows and\ndeducts any expenditures that are capital expenditures that are intended to\nmaintain operation of its gold producing assets. Management uses \"growth\ncapital\" to understand the cost to develop new operations or related to major\nprojects at existing operations where these projects will materially increase\nproduction. This measure is intended to provide additional information only\nand should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of\nperformance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain information contained in this news release, including any information\nrelating to New Gold's future financial or operating performance are \"forward-\nlooking\".

Must\nBuy](//images.mmorpg.com/images/heroes/posts/123038.jpg?cb=A0E2120B282FF26B84F983D36B5377B4)\n\nKeychron is one of the best-known names in mainstream mechanical keyboards. It\nhas a dozen keyboards to its name (including the Q1), so it's safe to say they\nknow a thing or two about designing a quality set of keys. Even so, the Q1\nmakes its debut as one of the best surprises of the year. It's a love letter\nto the custom keyboard community, packed to the brim with features usually\nreserved on expensive custom key sets, and coming in at only $169. If you're\nwilling to put in the time to apply some simple modifications, it becomes the\nhands-down best value mechanical keyboard available for the money. Move over\n[GMMK Pro](https://www.mmorpg.com/hardware-reviews/glorious-gmmk-pro-keyboard-\nkit-review-2000122634) and [IDOBAO Bestype](https://www.mmorpg.com/hardware-\nreviews/idobao-id80-bestype-keyboard-kit-review-2000122848), the Keychron Q1\nhas arrived.\n\n## **Specifications**\n\n  * Current Price: $169 ([Keychron](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q1)) \n  * Dimensions:\n    * Width: 145 mm\n    * Length 327.5 mm\n    * Front Height 21.6 mm  (without keycaps)\n    * Back Height 34.8 mm (without keycaps)\n    * Feet Height 2.4 mm\n    * Angle 5.2\u00b0\n  * Weight: 1600 g \u00b1 10g (the fully assembled weight)\n  * Body Material: Full CNC machined aluminum\n  * Plate: Aluminum\n  * KeycapsvDouble-shot ABS keycaps, not shine-through (fully assembled version)\n  * Switches: Gateron G Phantom (fully assembled version)\n  * Backlight: South-facing RGB LED\n  * Switch Support: Hot-swappable (5 pin & 3 pin)\n  * Stabs: Gateron screw-in PCB stabs\n  * Connectivity: Type-C cable\n  * Cable: Premium coiled Type-C cable (incl.

As someone who spends hours every day typing at his computer, I\nvalue a nice keyboard. I've progressed from gaming keyboards to custom\nkeyboards (or sometimes just modding nice keyboards by lubing the\nstabilizers). But as a school teacher by trade, I don't have the hundreds of\ndollars to throw at buying what YouTube says is the \"best\" mechanical\nkeyboard. Custom keyboards are on the rise, but it's an expensive hobby to get\ninto, especially if you don't you'll even find it to be that much better than\nwhat you're already using.\n\nThat's where the Keychron Q1 comes in. The team at Keychron has clearly been\nwatching the rise of keyboard streamers like TaehaTypes and the incredible\nrise MK content creators have experienced. People are abuzz for custom\nkeyboards and all of the bespoke features that come with them. To keep it\nshort: the Keychron Q1 has just about all of them.\n\nHere are the highlights:\n\n  * Gasket mount for a bouncy typing feel \n  * Full aluminum case\n  * Full programmability at the firmware level (no software needed to carry your keymaps/macros to other machines) with QMK and VIA\n  * Full RGB \n  * Hot-swappable, south-facing switches for solder-free changing and compatibility with high-end keycaps sets\n  * Pre-lubed screw-in stabilizers for less rattle and more stability\n  * Case foam\n  * PCB foam\n  * A customizable badge that can be swapped out for another switch or knob (rotary encoder) (coming soon)\n  * An included braided aviator cable that matches the case color\n  * Fully assembled or barebones purchase options\n  * Tons of accessories all available in one location with guaranteed compatibility (separate purchases, or course)\n  * Windows and Mac support, selectable with a switch on the back of the keyboard (that doubles as a hardware layer swap switch)\n  * An actually affordable price\n\nAll of these features give the Q1 feature parity with keyboards that cost\ntwice the price and sometimes more. Now, simply having a feature doesn't\nnecessarily mean it's implemented well, but by and large, Keychron has. They\ncould have charged $100 more for this kit, and if they were a smaller company,\nthey absolutely would have needed to.\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-Stock.jpg)\n\nWhat Keychron brings to the table (outside of experience) is scale. While most\ncustom keyboards rely on group buys to fund production -- users pay upfront\nand then wait for the production run to complete, incurring all the risk --\nKeychron is big enough to sign on for large orders upfront, keeping the cost\ndown. It also has the benefit of being able to learn from the experience of\ncompanies like Glorious whose GMMK Pro was criticized in a few key areas\ndespite being very good overall. Keychron didn't hit those same pitfalls and\nis better out of the box because of it.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, the Keychron Q1 is an all-aluminum, hot-swappable\nmechanical keyboard with a bouncy, super flexible typing experience, that can\nalso be programmed to your heart's content. It's not perfect out of the box\nand doesn't have native software for recording deep macros as easily as a\ndedicated gaming keyboard or advanced features timers or game-integrated\nlighting. But, feels great to type on, still works great for gaming, and with\na little time spent modding can sound downright amazing at a fraction of the\ncost of a group-bought custom.\n\n## **The Stock Keychron Q1**\n\nThe stock Keychron is a solid keyboard but has a few quirks that may or may\nnot bother you. It comes with your choice of Gateron Phantom Red, Phantom\nBrown, or Phantom Blue switches (or others if bought separately). It's also\nCarbon Black, Navy Blue, or Space Gray anodizations. Depending on which color\ncase you choose, you'll receive a matching set of doubleshot ABS keycaps.\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-Phantom-\nRed-Switches.jpg)\n\nI was sent the Navy Blue with Phantom Red switches, as well as a set of swap-\nout PBT keycaps and a walnut wrist rest to try. These are separate purchases\n($40 and $25 respectively), but only two of [many supporting\naccessories](https://www.keychron.com/pages/customize-your-keychron-q1)\navailable to buy. There are more than a dozen alternate PBT keycap sets to\nchoose from (as well as one ABS), three different plate materials (aluminum,\npolycarbonate, and brass), a huge array of switches from Gateron, Kailh,\nCherry, and Keychron to choose from, as well accessories for lubing switches.\nIn short, you can pick up just about anything you'll need to customize your\nkeyboard right from Keychron, excepting harder-to-find switches and odds and\nends like a paintbrush to apply your lube.\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-Side.jpg)\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-Bottom.jpg)\n\n__\n\n__\n\nStarting with the case: it's great. The anodization was consistent and well-\ndone. The Navy Blue is deep and rich, matching the pictures well. There are no\ntilt feet, which is normal for an aluminum case, but there is a 5-degree angle\nso you can type comfortably without a wrist rest if you choose. It comes\ntogether in two halves that are secured with eight gold-colored socket-cap\nscrews on the bottom. You'll need a hex-bit to remove these but I appreciate\nKeychron's attention to durability. These screws will be harder to strip than\na normal phillips-head fastener and the socket-cap has much more to material\nin general.\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-Stock-\nKeycapsjpg.jpg)\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-PBT-\nKeycaps.jpg)\n\n__\n\n__\n\nThe ABS keycaps are decent, but I would recommend upgrading to PBT if you can\nstretch your budget. They're an improvement over Keychron's normal keycaps\nthanks to their doubleshot molding. The legends are made of a separate piece\nof plastic, so they'll never fade, and the keycap walls seem to be thicker\nthan Keychron's normal 'caps too. The color scheme on the Navy Blue model\nlooks so great, I was disappointed I couldn't buy the same colorway in PBT.\nStill, ABS will shine over time and it has a lightweight sound profile.\n\nThe PBT keycaps, on the other hand, are dye-sublimated (so, single-shot with\ndye-stained legends and colored sides). They're definitely better but aren't\nthe most impressive in overall quality with some bleed along the bottom edge\ndue to the dying process. They're also in the taller OEM profile instead of\nlower-profile Cherry profile that's popular on high-end sets. Still, it's\nworth a buy for their increased thickness, durability, and more dense sound.\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-Exploded-\nView.jpg)\n\nDisassembling the case, you'll find that it includes a thin layer of foam\nunder the circuit board to reduce hollowness and reverberation through the\nmetal case. There's also a thicker layer of foam between the plate and the PCB\nto absorb sound. Another small touch: the USB port is a separate daughter\ncircuit board, which means it should be replaceable without having to trash\nyour whole keyboard if it breaks.\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-Case-\nFoam.jpg)\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-PCB-\nFoam.jpg)\n\n__\n\n__\n\nThe stabilizers also come pre-lubed and were pretty good out of the box! My\nbackspace key had a bit of rattle to it, but as a whole, the Q1 is much better\nthan your average prebuilt mechanical keyboard. Likewise, the sound of those\nlarger keys was more consistent with the rest of the board and more stable\nwith since they were held in place with an actual screw.\n\nI was also happy to find that the board was recognized immediately by VIA. VIA\nis a small app that allows you to program the keyboard with having to go\nthrough the hassle of actually flashing firmware. It was all the power of QMK\nbut its changes apply immediately. The graphical interface is also very simple\nand easy to understand, even if you've never used it before. The\nimplementation doesn't seem finished, though, as there was no tab for mapping\nlighting commands. You can manually add these with the \"Any\" keymap function,\nbut it new users won't want to deal with that, so hopefully an update comes\nsoon.\n\nThe Q1 has another high point to it: the gasket mount. Gasket mount refers to\nstrategically placed strips of poron foam around the edges of the plate, on\ntabs to keep it from moving during use. Rather than screw the plate into\neither side of the case, the two halves clamp down on these tabs which are\ncushioned by foam. The effect is twofold: typing vibrations are dampened\nbecause they hit the foam before traveling into the case; and, the keyset will\nphysically flex up and down for less stiff typing experience.\n\nAnd oh what flex. When pressed, the keyset noticeably travels. Don't worry,\nthe effect is subtle enough when typing that you won't be distracted by your\nkeys noticeably bouncing, but it creates the softer typing experience that\nmade gasket mounts become so popular. Frankly, it puts the GMMK Pro to shame\nas its gaskets did almost nothing out of the box. This is gasket mount as it\nshould be at a fraction of what you would usually be paying for its\nimplementation in a full aluminum keyboard.\n\nEven with all those positives, there are some issues that need addressing --\nand at least one, they say they are. The biggest is the amount of ping the\ncase makes when typing. It resonates with every keystroke and is distracting.\nKeychron has said that they're including extra foam in the box for retail\nunits to address this issue, but in my testing, I had to add a thick layer of\nspongy neoprene to dull the effect with foam as a material. I can't test their\nsolution, but this should be improved on retail units.\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-RGB-2.jpg)\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-Rgb-1jpg.jpg)\n\n__\n\n__\n\nSecond, the Phantom Red switches nearly negated the RGB backlighting. Like\nGateron Ink switches, the housings are color-matched to the type of switch.\nThat means the RGB LEDs are essentially hitting a red filter before shining\nout. Note in the picture above that the LED is shining blue but most of what's\nvisible is still red. The only way to fix this is to change switches or\ndisable RGB.\n\n## **Easily Modding the Keychron Q1 to Awesomeness**\n\nPing aside, the Q1 sounds alright out of the box, but it can be made to sound\ngreat. With a full set of easy to apply mods, I find myself preferring the Q1\nover any other my other custom keyboards, including the RAMA KARA and KOYU, my\nGMMK Pro, Drop ALT and CTRL (high profile versions), KBDFans KBD75V2 and even\nmy beloved KBDFans D60 WKL, despite it being the cheapest of the bunch. I'm\nnot alone. A [short typing test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_b_aW2B__A)\nI recorded has been met with enjoyment by every commenter on YouTube and every\nperson on Keychron's Discord and beyond I've shared it with. It's damn good\nfor the money.\n\nHave a listen to the fully modded result first:\n\n## **Keychron Q1 Typing Sounds**\n\nLet's take a look at how the keyboard sounds with these mods applied! This was\nrecorded before the new keycaps came in, so what you're hearing is with\nKeychron's PBT keycaps.\n\n## **Keychron Q1 - Modding Guide**\n\n**1\\. Lubed the stabilizers, added stabilizers pads** ** _(Stabilizers)_**\n\nStep one was to lube pull out the stabilizers and relube them for myself. I\ncoated the stems and housings in Krytox 205g0 and the wires with Permatex\ndielectric grease. I also used a set of [KBDFans' foam stabilizer\nstickers](https://kbdfans.com/products/kbdfans-stabilizers-foam-sticker) on\nthe PCB to cushion the stems when bottoming out the stabilized keys. This\neliminated all stabilizer rattle and, I have to say, I loved the sound of\nthese Gateron stabilzers! I would buy another set if I could find them\nanywhere.  \n\n**2\\. Added 2mm neoprene foam to the case -- then went back and swapped out\nfor 50mil Kilmat automotive sound deadening material ****_(Remove Case\nPing)_**\n\nI tried a couple of options to eliminate the ping and reverberation throughout\nthe case. First, I removed the stock thin foam and replaced it with a sheet of\n2mm sponge neoprene cut to size. I [used\nthis](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WDTFY9V/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1),\nbut other kinds of neoprene would also do the trick (the neoprene sheets used\nfor children's crafts are also good). It eliminated all audible ping in a\nnormal typing posture but did reduce the total amount of flex, which is one of\nthe things that makes the Q1 special. I also noticed that on [my typing\ntest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_b_aW2B__A), my microphone was able to\npick out a minor amount of ping that remained if you held your ear an inch\nabove the space bar.\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-Kilmat.jpg)\n\nTo solve both, I picked up a [pack of Kilmat 50\nmil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CBK48XN/) (1mm) sound deadening\nsheets. These are typically used to line the inside of your car doors to\nreduce reverberation and rattle for automotive sound systems. I cut it to\nsize, inserted it foil side down, and it worked even better than the neoprene.\nThere is no more ping whatsoever. This is admittedly an expensive solution,\nbut there's enough there to cover more than a dozen keyboards, if not twice as\nmuch.\n\n**3\\. PE Foam Mod** ** _(Improved Acoustics, Layer 1)_**\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-Switches-\nand-PE-Foam.jpg)\n\nThis is a new mod and one of the biggest and best things you can do to make\nthe Q1 sound fantastic. The PE foam mod is based on the Jelly Epoch custom\nkeyboard that released earlier this year and currently sells for $900-1000 in\nthe aftermarket. Essentially, you take the thin polyethylene (PE) foam the\nboard came in and cut out a sheet that matches the size of the PCB. You then\ncut out squares for your stabilizer and leave that positioned below the plate\nas you mount your switches. I also used the stock PCB foam.\n\nThis small layer of thin foam essentially acts as a high pass filter, cutting\nout some of the lower frequency switch noise. The result is a poppy or\n\"creamy\" sound that is very similar to Jelly Epoch and _so_ nice. This is one\nof my favorite mods. Bonus points in that it doesn't impact RGB very much at\nall.\n\n**4\\. Tempest Tape Mod** ** _(Improved Acoustics, Layer 2)_**\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-Tape-\nMod.jpg)\n\nThis mod struck me as weird at first but it actually does have a positive\nimpact on sound. The tape mod, as its name implies, involves papering the back\nof the PCB with painter's tape. I used two layers here. The effect, I believe,\nis similar to the PE foam mod in that you're filtering what makes its way\nthrough the case and tweaking the way frequencies will reflect on the inner\nchamber of the keyboard. If you apply this mod, just be sure to cut gaps for\nthe USB daughter board and the plate screws.\n\nWhile the case was open and tape was out, I also put little bits of tape near\nthe screw holes to create the \"break\" Keybored talks about in [his excellent\nQ1 mod video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmyiurli3Zg). (As an aside, his\nvideo made me smile. We essentially did the same things for most of our mods).\n\n**5\\. Standard switch and keycap swaps**\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-Silk-\nSwitches.jpg)\n\nThe other changes I made were meaningful but standard fare for keyboard\ncustomization. The first change was to swap out to [NovelKeys Silk\nBlack](https://novelkeys.com/products/nk_-silk-\nseries?_pos=2&_sid=b0f0d532f&_ss=r) switches. They're a heavier linear switch\nproduced by JWK and are lubed with Krytox 205g0 from the factory. They're\ngreat out of the box, so no lubing is required (on the V2 version being sold\nnow; V1 _did_ require extra lubing for the best experience) but still benefit\nif you'd like to clean them and apply yourself. They have a very light, clacky\nsound that works wonderfully with the PE foam and tape mods.\n\nFor keycaps, I went with EPBT x GOK Black on White. They're thick, bright\nwhite keycaps with extra caps for different layouts should I want to change in\nthe future. They're also lightly texture, which always feels nice under the\nfingers. The shorter height also lends itself to a clackier (higher-pitched)\ntyping experience.\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-EPBTxGOK-\nBoW.jpg)\n\n## **Keychron Q1 vs GMMK Pro**\n\nThe biggest comparison potential customers are likely to make is against the\nGlorious GMMK Pro. Both are entry-level, all-metal custom gasket mount\nkeyboards. Both keyboards are a good value for the money. Both can be\ncustomized out the wazoo.\n\nBut in a head-to-head battle, there's no question: the Keychron Q1 is the\nbetter buy, and here's why. Despite the fact that these keyboards look very\nsimilar, the Q1 is more successful on the fundamentals of what it's trying to\ndo. Where the gasket mount on the GMMK Pro existed to check a marketing box,\nthe Q1s actually works and is delightfully flexy. Where the GMMK Pro\nproclaimed its customs stabs as Greatest Of All Time (GOAT), they were\nanything but and were actually sticky on my model. Here, they not only work\nbut they sound great!\n\nThere are things the GMMK does better. Glorious packed so much foam in that\nkeyboard that ping just wasn't an issue. The RGB is also better and includes\nthose stylish side RGB strips. On top of that, if you're a gamer, the Glorious\nCore software will allow you to record normal macros with the ease of a record\nbutton. The Q1, on the other hand, puts macros inside VIA/QMK which isn't\nnearly so user friendly for macro recording. Then there's the knob -- it's\ncool and genuinely nice for controlling volume. The Q1 will eventually have\none available for purchase, but it looks like it will require a separate\ncircuit board, so could be cumbersome to install.\n\nFinally, we have that \"matching\" $169 price. Even though it looks like both\nkeyboards are priced identically, remember that the GMMK Pro doesn't come with\nswitches or keycaps. Buying those from Glorious will set you back another $70,\nmaking the Q1 a significantly better value.\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/382021/Keychron-Q1-Final-\nProduct-Fixed.jpg)\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\nThe Keychron Q1 is one of the biggest surprises of the year. The out-of-box\nexperience is good and will be better with the added foam on the retail units.\nWhat really sets it apart is how good it can become with a handful of easy\nmods. When fully outfitted, this is the best sounding and feeling aluminum\nkeyboard you can buy under $200. If you've been considering a custom keyboard,\nor even just a Keychron, you owe it to yourself to give it a try. On its own,\nthis keyboard is an 8 but with the mods described here easily becomes a 9+.\nDon't sleep on the Q1.\n\n![](https://images.mmorpg.com/images/contentImages/372021/Golden_Hardware_Award.png)\n\n_The product described in this article was provided by the manufacturer for\nevaluation purposes._  \n\n**8.5** **Great**\n\n**Pros**\n\n  * Full aluminum build\n  * Bouncy gasket mount\n  * QMK and VIA programmable out of the box\n  * One of the most affordable, aluminum customs available\n  * Easily moddable\n\n**Cons**\n\n  * Very pingy out of the box\n  * No native software which limits gaming specific software features\n  * Requires modding to sound its best \n\nTags\n\n[Mechanical Keyboards](/tags/mechanical-keyboards)\n\n[Peripherals](/tags/peripherals)\n\n[Keychron](/tags/keychron)\n\n[Keychron Q1](/tags/keychron-q1)\n\n* * *\n\n![GameByNight](//images.mmorpg.com/images/avatars/1155446_Profile 21.JPG)\n\n### Christopher Coke\n\nChris cut his teeth on MMOs in the late 90s with text-based MUDs.

/ ACCESSWIRE / September 13, 2021 /** Biovica International\n(STO:BIOVIC-B)(STO:BIOVIC.B)(FRA:9II)\n\n **Biovica, active in cancer diagnostics, today announced that the company 's\nexpected timeline for its updated 510(k)-application to the US Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) has been prolonged due to delay in response from FDA.**\n\nAs Biovica is still waiting for required feedback from the FDA the company has\nnot been able to submit its updated application yet. This means that the\ncompany most likely will not receive an answer from the FDA before the end of\nSeptember, as previously communicated.\n\nAfter submitting the response to the FDA, the expected outcome is either\napproval (clearance) or a request to submit more information.\n\n\"It is of course unfortunate that the FDA process is delayed. It is caused by\nthe pandemic situation and unfortunately out of our control. We are ready to\nsubmit updates to the application but need to have patience and understanding\nabout how the pandemic situation has affected processing times at the FDA.\nThankfully, this is a short-term obstacle that will be overcome in due time,\"\nsaid Anders Rylander.\n\n **Contact**\n\nAnders Rylander, CEO  \nPhone: +46-18-444 48 35  \nE-mail: [anders.rylander@biovica.com](mailto:anders.rylander@biovica.com)\n\n **Biovica - Treatment decisions with greater confidence**\n\nBiovica develops and commercializes blood-based biomarker assays to evaluate\nefficacy of cancer treatments. Biovica's assay DiviTum\u00ae measure cell\nproliferation by detecting a biomarker in the blood stream. The assay has\nsuccessfully demonstrated its capabilities to early evaluate therapy\neffectiveness in several clinical trials. The first application for DiviTum is\nmonitoring of treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Biovica's\nvision is that all cancer patients will get an optimal treatment from day one.\nBiovica collaborates with world-leading cancer institutes and pharmaceutical\ncompanies.

for a durable, all-metal build. But, of course, metal\nweighs more than plastic. The Leica SL 50mm f2 Summicron is designed to be a\nlighter, more compact alternative to the Leica SL 50mm f1.4 Summilux. Of\ncourse, the term lighter is relative; I wouldn\u2019t call a metal lens a\nlightweight. Yet it\u2019s still lighter than the Panasonic Lumix S Pro 50mm f1.4\nand Leica\u2019s f1.4, and feels almost perfectly balanced with the Panasonic S5\nbody.\n\nWhile the design isn\u2019t as heavy, the lens still produces some of the same\nbeautiful color and sharpness. I spent two weeks shooting portraits,\nlifestyle, and landscape photos with the Leica 50mm f2 to see what this lens\ncan capture.\n\n## Too Long, Didn\u2019t Read\n\nThe Leica SL 50mm f2 Summicron is a well-built, metal-body lens that\u2019s both\nsimple and beautiful to use. The images are spectacular, and they achieve a\nhappy medium between eliminating distortion and eliminating character. But,\n[it\u2019s pricey](https://www.amazon.com/Leica-APO-SUMMICRON-SL-50mm-Aspherical-\nLens/dp/B083W2HXBZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Leica+50mm+f2+sl&qid=1631278857&sr=8-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=phobyah00-20&linkId=0d769ddf19fade247deab5cded1f9cd4&language=en_US)\nand, like we noted with the f1.4 Summilux, the autofocus isn\u2019t perfect.\n\n## Pros and Cons\n\n![]()![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ms.8gsjWGkkrvjwwiHnotQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYzOS41ODQ0MTU1ODQ0MTU2/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EBRm2v70lN0pc_CHuaikpA--~B/aD01MTM7dz03NzA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/phoblographer_articles_809/bb84bc3921f3fa5c94451cb62f7355da)\n\n### Pros\n\n  * Beautiful metal build\n\n  * Excellent mix of quality and character\n\n  * Nice contrast\n\n  * Lovely bokeh\n\n  * Simple design\n\n  * About 25% lighter than the Leica 50mm f1.2 SL\n\n### Cons\n\n  * [Expensive](https://www.amazon.com/Leica-APO-SUMMICRON-SL-50mm-Aspherical-Lens/dp/B083W2HXBZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Leica+50mm+f2+sl&qid=1631278857&sr=8-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=phobyah00-20&linkId=0d769ddf19fade247deab5cded1f9cd4&language=en_US)\n\n  * L system autofocus still lags behind\n\n  * Slight corner softness\n\n## Gear Used\n\nI used the Leica 50mm f2 SL with the [Panasonic\nS5](https://www.thephoblographer.com/2020/10/29/their-best-camera-yet-but-a-\nways-to-go-panasonic-s5-review/). I kept it simple and didn\u2019t use a hood. And\nI paired it with a WANDRD wrist strap.\n\n## Innovations\n\nThe 50mm f2 is really meant as a lighter alternative to [Leica\u2019s 50mm f1.4\nSummilux](https://www.thephoblographer.com/2020/04/14/review-leica-\nsl-50mm-f1-4-summilux-the-best-l-mount-portrait-lens/). What\u2019s unique with the\nway Leica handles these lighter f2 lenses is that they still focus on\neliminating aberrations and other distortions. This is not the low-quality\nversion of the f1.4, just a low bokeh version. Otherwise, the innovation here\nis what\u2019s innovative about Leica\u2019s other lenses \u2014 durable all-metal design.\n\n## Tech Specs\n\nLeica [lists these tech specs](https://us.leica-camera.com/Photography/Leica-\nSL/SL-Lenses/Prime-Lenses/APO-Summicron-SL-50) for the 50mm Summicron:\n\n  * Field angle (diagonal, horizontal, vertical): 47.2\u00b0/40\u00b0/27.3\u00b0\n\n  * Number of lenses/groups: 12/10\n\n  * Number of asph. surfaces / lenses: 4/3\n\n  * Entrance pupil position: 63.2 mm at \u221e\n\n  * Working range: \u221e to 0.35 m\n\n  * Smallest object field: 120 x 180 mm\n\n  * Largest reproduction ratio 1:5\n\n  * Aperture Setting/function: Electronically controlled aperture, set using turn/push wheel on camera, including half and third values\n\n  * Aperture setting range: 2 \u2013 22\n\n  * Lowest value: 22\n\n  * Bayonet/sensor format: L-Mount, full-frame 35 mm format\n\n  * Filter mount: E67\n\n  * Length to bayonet mount: 102 mm\n\n  * Largest diameter: 73 mm\n\n  * Weight: 740 g (27.87 oz.)\n\n## Ergonomics\n\nStory continues\n\n![]()![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/T9o7QLd2vzglIcPizCH0SQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYzOS41ODQ0MTU1ODQ0MTU2/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LlezFOBrx7INUdDcnbTTaQ--~B/aD01MTM7dz03NzA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/phoblographer_articles_809/5a7f70eabe7ca2fe676c080cd7f0ef9f)\n\nThe Leica 50mm f2 SL has a design that I\u2019ve come to expect from the German\ncompany. The all-metal design makes the lens feel like it\u2019s been around since\nwell before the Leica SL. Yet, at the same time, the metal build makes this\nlens feel like a tank.\n\nLeica says the 50mm f2 SL is designed to be smaller and lighter than the\nbrighter nifty fifty. Now, no one buys an all-metal Leica because it\u2019s tiny\nand light. But, comparatively speaking, the 50mm f2 SL isn\u2019t quite as much of\na beast as the 50mm f1.2 SL. It\u2019s about 25 percent lighter, weighing about 1.7\npounds, and 18 percent shorter at a touch over four inches. It\u2019s also lighter\nthan the [Panasonic 50mm f1.4 Lumix S\nPro](https://www.thephoblographer.com/2020/02/27/review-\npanasonic-50mm-f1-4-lumix-s-pro-a-beauty-of-the-l-mount/). There are lighter\nand smaller nifty fifties out there, but the Leica SL 50mm f2 is more of a\nhappy medium between a plastic lens and a beastly bright metal one. It\nbalances well mounted on the front of the Panasonic S5, feeling only slightly\nfront-heavy.\n\n![]()![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NEb80Ihffl.S51ebr8RGxg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYzOS41ODQ0MTU1ODQ0MTU2/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AEjWkbLxrDofrRIvSEu67A--~B/aD01MTM7dz03NzA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/phoblographer_articles_809/60b0dface121dac97738c5ff613d05fd)\n\nThe lens has just a single control \u2014 a large manual focus ring. I didn\u2019t mind\nthe simplified controls, since the S5 has a focus mode switch that\u2019s as simple\nto use as one on a lens. But, that\u2019s not the case with every L mount camera\nbody. The ring turns smoothly. It\u2019s a slower, stiffer turn that allows for\nmore precise manual focusing adjustments.\n\nThe front of the lens has a smaller 67mm filter size. Brighter lenses tend to\nhave larger front optics and less of an edge at the front. Except for a small\nbump out from the mount, the lens is the same diameter the whole way through.\n\n## Build Quality\n\n![]()![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JF.yWOIonVjk_dBL2SAcrg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYzOS41ODQ0MTU1ODQ0MTU2/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XYXEaHKFX_Fm.VyC0UyS_g--~B/aD01MTM7dz03NzA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/phoblographer_articles_809/eba27fb27af01b92e28ba1e831372fa2)\n\nThere\u2019s really nothing like an all-metal lens. The Leica 50mm f2 SL is built\nlike a tank. It feels every bit the luxury lens that it is. The focus ring\nturns smoothly and slowly.\n\nThe lens is also weather-sealed. I splashed the lens with a few handfuls of\nwater. The lens and camera kept on shooting and I didn\u2019t find any moisture in\nthe mount. The lens also kept sand out when I shot at the beach. (The camera\nand lens did get some dust inside from outdoor lens swaps.)\n\n## Autofocus\n\n![]()![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aEttgxUY4dkBzldzVGJfsQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYzOS41ODQ0MTU1ODQ0MTU2/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xAOr2D79liVxkEjBbK_DEA--~B/aD01MTM7dz03NzA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/phoblographer_articles_809/157fee6064aa8181767eeff0473a0fce)\n\nThe Leica 50mm f2 SL uses dual drive autofocus motors. The motors are quiet\nenough not to draw attention to the photographer. The autofocus is generally\nfast, but not quite as robust as Canon\u2019s or Sony\u2019s. The lens is fast enough\nfor portraits and freezing subjects at a walk but slows down when working at\nclose range.\n\nThe autofocus had a near-perfect hit rate with moving subjects several feet\naway. Closer to the lens\u2019 1.15-foot limit, the opposite was true and most of\nthe shots were soft. The 1.15 autofocus limit is true for stationary subjects,\nbut with moving subjects, you\u2019ll want them to be at least three feet from the\nlens. This is expected, especially when working with subjects that are heading\nstraight towards the camera.\n\nFor portraits, I had a few soft shots of a squirmy toddler. Photographing a\nteenager, that miss rate dropped dramatically. Occasionally, you\u2019ll get a shot\nthat\u2019s not quite on the eyes, but it\u2019s not bad.\n\nI did have some trouble locking focus when shooting backlit, particularly with\ndarker subjects like the chocolate-brown fur on my dog. However, when I\nswapped out the Leica 50mm f2 for the S5\u2019s kit lens and shot the same exact\nscene, the autofocus still had trouble. That lead me to believe that it\u2019s the\nS5\u2019s autofocus that has a lower hit rate with backlighting.\n\n## Ease of Use\n\n![]()![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2rsMrABLExTPJIe2XW5GXA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYzOS41ODQ0MTU1ODQ0MTU2/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PNpnVQTS3jeJMiujCNfgLQ--~B/aD01MTM7dz03NzA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/phoblographer_articles_809/d094f27d7a45709dd9e27b2f758e9c09)\n\nDon\u2019t let the label fool you \u2014 the Leica SL 50mm f2 is as simple as mount and\nshoot. While the price point may put it out of a beginner\u2019s reach, the\ncontrols will not. There\u2019s just the single focus ring. That means there are no\nextra controls to learn.\n\nSometimes, a lack of controls makes it slower for advanced photographers, but\nI didn\u2019t find that to be the case here. There\u2019s an S to C to MF control right\non the S5 body, so an M to AF switch would have been redundant. That may not\nbe the case with the Leica SL2, however. The lens also doesn\u2019t have a depth of\nfield scale, but with the focus peaking on the camera body, I didn\u2019t miss it.\n\n## Image Quality\n\n![]()![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jiKa6F0Gg0vcCDOEusUyrw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYzOS41ODQ0MTU1ODQ0MTU2/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uwVZgKBzonL..NvJCcTDUQ--~B/aD01MTM7dz03NzA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/phoblographer_articles_809/701f37ec52425111388996f3889f2fc6)\n\nWhile it\u2019s not the brightest nifty fifty for L mount shooters, the Leica 50mm\nf2 SL still delivers beautiful bokeh, solid contrast, and minimal distortion.\nThe lens offers an ideal balance of the things modern photographers are\nlooking for without eliminating the potential for a bit of character. The lens\nmixes minimal distortion and good sharpness with the potential for some flare.\n\n### Bokeh\n\n![]()![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/C24J0A1VDL2QerpOkf4H0g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYzOS41ODQ0MTU1ODQ0MTU2/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PVr.UN6eYycKpXSBk6muxg--~B/aD01MTM7dz03NzA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/phoblographer_articles_809/ef1525822ad5bb481f1a6524a4666ecd)\n\nAt f2, subjects still pop from the background. When focused on the eyes, the\nfalloff isn\u2019t as quick as an f1.2. It\u2019s easier to get both the eyes and\neyelashes in focus, but the nose doesn\u2019t blur as quickly. However, the\nbackground still has great separation from the subject. Is it going to be as\ngreat as an f1.2? No, but I don\u2019t think anyone is going to look at these\nphotos and whisper, \u201c _tsk tsk, should have used the f1.2._ \u201c\n\nBokeh balls are soft, with no hard edges. Most of the bokeh this lens captured\nwas also smooth throughout, but you may occasionally find a bit of soap bubble\nbokeh from particularly harsh light sources. Bokeh is circular at the center,\nbut takes on a cat-eye shape towards the edges. If you have a lot of bokeh,\nthe mix of circles and cats eyes will give the background a swirly look.\n\n### Sharpness\n\n![]()![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GTEDByDHXTAob7myR3yuMA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYzOS41ODQ0MTU1ODQ0MTU2/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sRprNx.VtDIG8vyPdtOMdQ--~B/aD01MTM7dz03NzA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/phoblographer_articles_809/e6dbba9e6e70d14663f425beb97bdf06)\n\nThis lens is tack sharp at the center, even shooting wide open. The very\ncorners are slightly soft but sharpen quickly at f4. You won\u2019t notice that\ncorner softness in most shots \u2014 and it will, in fact, draw the eye to the\ncenter. It\u2019s likely part of that swirly bokeh as well. But, if you want to\ntake a shot with the subject in the corner, you may want to set the aperture\nto f4 or more.\n\n### Lens Character\n\n![]()![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TeQPHAeJuEzU2jhJOBa9xg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYzOS41ODQ0MTU1ODQ0MTU2/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Jv66g1ZvLSRF3Xq8dGmp3A--~B/aD01MTM7dz03NzA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/phoblographer_articles_809/01b37a5335c6a05e479cf47c929a6ec6)\n\nThe Leica 50mm f2 SL eliminates the annoying distortion while leaving just\nenough for some character. I couldn\u2019t spot my two least favorite character\nflaws \u2014 barrel distortion and chromatic aberration. Lines still appeared\nstraight. And, even viewing high contrast backlit subjects, I couldn\u2019t pick up\nmuch aberration.\n\nThe flare coming from this 50mm builds character. Shooting at golden hour, the\nlens captures some beautiful soft sun. When positioned just right, the lens\nwill grab some nice streaks of light. The 50mm can also grab some circular\nlens flare as well, but even shooting without a hood, I could eliminate the\nflare by adjusting my angle just slightly.\n\nThe Leica 50mm f2 SL has this ideal mix of modern image quality and long-\nstanding character. Flaws like aberration and barrel distortion are well\ncontrolled. Yet, you can still get some soft, streaky light and spots of\nflare.\n\n### Color Rendering\n\n![]()![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/i_cMi5txIWuSV6MFC3ogMg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYzOS41ODQ0MTU1ODQ0MTU2/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gmPAcpFzwPyw68Kx1x93xQ--~B/aD01MTM7dz03NzA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/phoblographer_articles_809/7fd0578c9cf9dd23e5709133acc71aa4)\n\nThe colors captured on the Leica 50mm f2 SL are beautiful. Colors were largely\naccurate, with a few colors that seemed to capture slightly dark. I got a lot\nof great contrast shooting mid-day, and softer, lighter colors working backlit\nat golden hour.\n\n## Extra Image Samples\n\n _From day one, The Phoblographer has been huge on transparency with our\naudience. Nothing from this review is sponsored. Further, lots of folks will\npost reviews that show lots of editing in the photos. The problem then becomes\nthat anyone and everyone can do the same thing. They\u2019re not showing what the\nlens can do. So we have a section in our Extra Image Samples area to show\nedited and unedited photos.

Conclusions\n\n### Likes\n\n  * The metal design is both beautiful and durable.\n\n  * Distortion is well-controlled, yet there\u2019s still some character from flare and bokeh.\n\n  * The contrast and bokeh still look great.\n\n  * The design is easy to use.\n\n  * It\u2019s lighter than Leica\u2019s and Panasonic\u2019s 50mm f1.4.\n\n### Dislikes\n\n  * It\u2019s $5,095.\n\n  * The autofocus is just okay.\n\n  * There\u2019s some minor corner softness.\n\nThe Leica SL 50mm f2 Summicron is a well-balanced lens. It doesn\u2019t make the\ncamera body too front-heavy, and it balances image quality with character-\nbuilding bokeh and flare. The metal design withstood both water and sand. Even\nas an f2, it delivers some beautiful bokeh with great background separation.\n\nBut, the autofocus is just okay. This is in part the L mount system. We noted\nin our S5 review that the body doesn\u2019t focus as well with Leica lenses as it\ndoes with Panasonic glass. It will capture a lot of sharp shots, but it\u2019s not\nquite as fast as Canon or Sony systems.\n\nThe other downside is the price. A $5,095 price point is expected on a Leica,\nbut the f1.4 is $5,995. $900 on any other lens system would be a big price\ndifference. But, it\u2019s only a 15 percent price drop to lose a stop of light and\nroughly half a pound.\n\nOverall, the Leica SL 50mm f2 Summicron delivers excellent images inside a\nbeautiful lens. I\u2019m giving this lens four out of five stars.\n\n![]()![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/U58VC8_qGxI8ygLsI4LTjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTIyMi43Mg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8zSUBkdTHPtwt3cjC5DWSg--~B/aD0xNDU7dz02MjU7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/phoblographer_articles_809/4724bd6de4e960e18be1bfbd5e80c280)\n\n###\n\nTRENDING\n\n  * 1\\. \n\n#### [Explainer-How will Biden's vaccine mandate impact workers,\ncompanies?](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-bidens-vaccine-mandate-\nimpact-115612730.html)\n\n  * 2\\. \n\n#### [Stock market news live updates: Futures rise as stocks look to end\n5-session losing streak](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-\nlive-updates-september-13-2021-115039142.html)\n\n  * 3\\. \n\n#### [Germany has four months to certify Nord Stream 2\npipeline](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/germany-four-months-certify-\nnord-114609484.html)\n\n  * 4\\. \n\n#### [Aluminum Hits $3,000 for First Time in 13 Years on Supply\nSnarl](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aluminum-powers-\ntoward-3-000-044142340.html)\n\n  * 5\\. \n\n#### [No 'magic wand' to fix Lebanon crisis, new prime minister\nsays](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/no-magic-wand-fix-lebanon-113727908.html)\n\n![](https://ter-adserver-origin-\nus.prod.adtechus.com/adcount%7C2.0%7C5113.1%7C4830119%7C0%7C225%7CAdId=11101985;BnId=2;ct=1109201828;st=22856;adcid=1;itime=534630141;reqtype=5;guid=0hcasj5gjebqh&b=3&s=4e;;impref=1631534630143512432;imprefseq=38568742094898286;imprefts=1631534630;adclntid=1004;spaceid=1183334825;adposition=LDRB2;lmsid=a0V6T00000KBIsKUAX;revshare=lmsid%253Aa0V6T00000KBIsKUAX%253Brevsp%253Aphoblographer%255Farticles%255F809%253Blpstaid%253A409f2f02%252D964b%252D3608%252Db552%252D318657edb406%253Blu%253A0%253Bpct%253Astory%253Bpt%253Acontent%253Bsite%253Afinance%253Bver%253Aarticle%253Bpd%253Anon%255Fmodal;pvid=MxC.KTEwLjIIsVyZYTcvUdbXMTg4LgAAAABCHBaK;sectionid=165243551;kvpgcolo=ir2;kvhashtag=1720500:2299500:2305000:1721500:1728000;kvrs=a0v6t00000kbiskuax:article:pd:0:content:lmsid:finance:pct:phoblographer%5Farticles%5F809:story:pt:site:lu:revsp:lpstaid:non%5Fmodal:409f2f02%2D964b%2D3608%2Db552%2D318657edb406:ver;kvssp=ssp;kvctopid=1720500:2299500:2305000:1721500:1728000;kvsecure=true;kvmn=y400117;kvy%2Dbucket=fd%2Dlinkbroker%2Dupsell%2Dfooter%2Cfd%2Desi%2Ddisabled%2Ca2%2Dplutus%2Drr%2D2%2Cfd%2Dadobe%2Dpromo%2D2%2Cxray%2Dus%2Dfinance%2Drelatedq%2Dtest%2D1%2Cfd%2Dreminder%2Dupsell%2D2%2Cfd%2Drr%2Dhp%2Drr%2D1%2Cfinancelive%2Dntk%2Dviewability%2D3a;kvwiki%5Ftopics=leica%5Fsl%5F%2528typ%5F601%2529:the%5Flens;kvsecure%2Ddarla=4%2D6%2D0%7Cysd%7C1;kvadtc%5Fdvmktname=unknown;kvadtc%5Fdvosplt=windows%5F7;kvadtc%5Fdvbrand=microsoft;kvadtc%5Fdvtype=desktop;kvadtc%5Fdvmodel=internet%5Fexplorer%5F%2D%5Fwindows;kvrepo%5Fdvosplt=windows%5F7;kvadtc%5Fdvosversion=NT%206%2E1;kvadtc%5Fcrmcc=UNKNOWN;kvadtc%5Fcrmnc=UNKNOWN;gdpr=1;euconsent=CPMJ-\nTOPMJ-\nTOAOACBSVBACoAP_AAH_AACiQHCNd_X_fb39j-_59__t0eY1f9_7_v20zjgeds-8Nyd_X_L8X_2M7vB36pr4KuR4ku3bBAQFtHOncTQmx6IlVqTPsak2Mr7NKJ7PEinsbe2dYGHtfn9VT-\nZKZr97s___7________79______3_vt_9__wOCAJMNS-\nAizEscCSaNKoUQIQriQ6AEAFFCMLRNYQErgp2VwEfoIGACA1ARgRAgxBRiyCAAAAAJKIgBADwQCIAiAQAAgBUgIQAEaAILACQMAgAFANCwAigCECQgyOCo5TAgIkWignkrAEou9jDCEMooAaAGGgAwABA4QRABgACBwgqADAAEDhA;)\n\n###\n\nRecommended Stories\n\n  * ![](https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190501/placeholder.gif)\n\nTipRanks\n\n#### [These 3 Stocks Could Rally Over 60%, Says\nBMO](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-3-stocks-surge-over-235716837.html)\n\nIn recent sessions, we\u2019ve seen conflicting trends pulling at the stock market.\nOverall, stocks are up.

Gold logo (CNW Group/New Gold Inc.)\n\nTORONTO, Sept. 13, 2021 /CNW/ - **New Gold Inc. ( \"New Gold\" or the\n\"Company\")** (TSX: NGD) and (NYSE American: NGD) provides an update to its\n2021 operational outlook for the Rainy River Mine and the consolidated\noperational outlook. All amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise\nindicated.\n\nIn early August, the Company indicated that July production at Rainy River was\nprimarily from the eastern area of the ODM zone (\"East Lobe\") and the realized\ngold grade from this area was below the modeled gold grade in this period.\nThis trend continued in August. Over both July and August, the modeled East\nLobe high and medium grade ore negatively reconciled to ounces mined, leading\nto a total of approximately 20,000 lower gold ounces produced during this\nperiod. The Company has since followed up with additional reverse circulation\ndrilling and globally, all areas outside of the East Lobe, continues to\nreconcile well where mining has occurred or is about to occur, and are\nconsistent with historical results. The East Lobe represents approximately 35%\nof planned production for the remaining period of September to December 2021.\nAs a result of the variance experienced in the East Lobe, Rainy River's gold\nequivalent1 production for 2021 is now expected to be between 240,000 and\n255,000 ounces.\n\nThe Company continues reverse circulation drilling in the East Lobe and the\nunderstanding of the mineralization is improving, however, additional drilling\nis required to refine the block model and improve its predictability. The\nCompany is advancing an underground optimization study for Rainy River, with\ncompletion anticipated by year-end, and results would be incorporated into the\nyear-end Mineral Reserve and Resource and life of mine update.\n\n _\" While the reduction in our near-term guidance at Rainy River is\nunfortunate, I remain confident the mine has reached an inflection point, as\nevidenced by the free cash flow generated in the second quarter and the mine\nis on track to deliver an improved second half of the year\", stated Renaud\nAdams, President & CEO. We continue to seek ways to further optimize our costs\nand capital profiles, and with the underground growth potential currently\nbeing evaluated, Rainy River is expected to be a meaningful contributor of\nfree cash flow in our portfolio going forward.\" _\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result of the Rainy River revisions, consolidated gold equivalent1\nproduction for 2021 is now expected to be between 405,000 and 450,000 ounces.\nAnnual consolidated copper production guidance remains unchanged at 56 to 66\nmillion pounds. New Gold expects its consolidated 2021 all-in sustaining costs\nto be between $1,415 to $1,495 per gold eq. ounce2, and total cash costs to be\nbetween $960 to $1,030 per gold eq. ounce2.

The Company also holds an 8% gold stream on the\nArtemis Gold Blackwater project located in Canada, a 6% equity stake in\nArtemis Gold Inc., and other Canadian-focused investments. New Gold's vision\nis to build a leading diversified intermediate gold company based in Canada\nthat is committed to environment and social responsibility.

Total gold eq. ounces include silver and copper produced/sold converted to\na gold eq. based on a ratio of $1,800 per gold ounce, $25.00 per silver ounce\nand $3.50 per copper pound used for 2021 guidance estimates. All copper is\nproduced/sold by the New Afton Mine. Gold equivalent ounces guidance includes\napproximately 585,000 to 600,000 ounces of silver at Rainy River and\napproximately 250,000 to 270,000 ounces of silver at New Afton.\n\n2\\. \"Total cash costs\", \"all-in sustaining costs\", \"sustaining capital and\nsustaining leases\", \"growth capital\", \"cash generated from operations\", \"free\ncash flow\" and \"average realized gold/copper price per ounce/pound\" are all\nnon-GAAP financial performance measures that are used in this press release.\nThese measures do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore\nmay not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. For more\ninformation about these measures, why they are used by the Company, and a\nreconciliation to the most directly comparable measure under IFRS, see the\n\"Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures\" section of this news release.\n\n **Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures**\n\nTotal Cash Costs per Gold eq. Ounce\n\n\"Total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce\" is a non-GAAP financial\nperformance measure that is a common financial performance measure in the gold\nmining industry but does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and\ntherefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other\nissuers. New Gold reports total cash costs on a sales basis and not on a\nproduction basis. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional\nmeasures prepared in accordance with IFRS, this measure, along with sales, is\na key indicator of the Company's ability to generate operating earnings and\ncash flow from its mining operations. This measure allows investors to better\nevaluate corporate performance and the Company's ability to generate liquidity\nthrough operating cash flow to fund future capital exploration and working\ncapital needs.\n\nThis measure is intended to provide additional information only and should not\nbe considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance\nprepared in accordance with IFRS. This measure is not necessarily indicative\nof cash generated from operations under IFRS or operating costs presented\nunder IFRS.\n\nTotal cash cost figures are calculated in accordance with a standard developed\nby The Gold Institute, a worldwide association of suppliers of gold and gold\nproducts that ceased operations in 2002. Adoption of the standard is voluntary\nand the cost measures presented may not be comparable to other similarly\ntitled measures of other companies. Total cash costs include mine site\noperating costs such as mining, processing and administration costs,\nroyalties, production taxes, but are exclusive of amortization, reclamation,\ncapital and exploration costs. Total cash costs are then divided by gold\nequivalent ounces sold to arrive at the total cash costs per equivalent ounce\nsold.\n\nIn addition to gold the Company produces copper and silver. Gold equivalent\nounces of copper and silver produced or sold in a quarter are computed using a\nconsistent ratio of copper and silver prices to the gold price and multiplying\nthis ratio by the pounds of copper and silver ounces produced or sold during\nthat quarter.\n\nNotwithstanding the impact of copper and silver sales, as the Company is\nfocused on gold production, New Gold aims to assess the economic results of\nits operations in relation to gold, which is the primary driver of New Gold's\nbusiness. New Gold believes this metric is of interest to its investors, who\ninvest in the Company primarily as a gold mining business. To determine the\nrelevant costs associated with gold equivalent ounces, New Gold believes it is\nappropriate to reflect all operating costs incurred in its operations.\n\nAll-In Sustaining Costs per Gold eq. Ounce\n\n\"All-in sustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce\" is a non-GAAP financial\nperformance measure that does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and\ntherefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other\nissuers. New Gold calculates \"all-in sustaining costs per gold equivalent\nounce\" based on guidance announced by the World Gold Council (\"WGC\") in\nSeptember 2013. The WGC is a non-profit association of the world's leading\ngold mining companies established in 1987 to promote the use of gold to\nindustry, consumers and investors. The WGC is not a regulatory body and does\nnot have the authority to develop accounting standards or disclosure\nrequirements. The WGC has worked with its member companies to develop a\nmeasure that expands on IFRS measures to provide visibility into the economics\nof a gold mining company. Current IFRS measures used in the gold industry,\nsuch as operating expenses, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to\ndiscover, develop and sustain gold production. New Gold believes that \"all-in\nsustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce\" provides further transparency into\ncosts associated with producing gold and will assist analysts, investors, and\nother stakeholders of the Company in assessing its operating performance, its\nability to generate free cash flow from current operations and its overall\nvalue. In addition, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors uses\n\"all-in sustaining costs\", together with other measures, in its Company\nscorecard to set incentive compensation goals and assess performance.\n\n\"All-in sustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce\" is intended to provide\nadditional information only and does not have any standardized meaning under\nIFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other mining\ncompanies. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for\nmeasures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. The measure is not\nnecessarily indicative of cash flow from operations under IFRS or operating\ncosts presented under IFRS.\n\nNew Gold defines \"all-in sustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce\" as the\nsum of total cash costs, net capital expenditures that are sustaining in\nnature, corporate general and administrative costs, capitalized and expensed\nexploration that is sustaining in nature, lease payments that are sustaining\nin nature, and environmental reclamation costs, all divided by the total gold\nequivalent ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure. The definition of\nsustaining versus non-sustaining is similarly applied to capitalized and\nexpensed exploration costs and lease payments. Exploration costs and lease\npayments to develop new operations or that relate to major projects at\nexisting operations where these projects are expected to materially increase\nproduction are classified as non-sustaining and are excluded. Gold equivalent\nounces of copper and silver produced or sold in a quarter are computed using a\nconsistent ratio of copper and silver prices to the gold price and multiplying\nthis ratio by the pounds of copper and silver ounces produced or sold during\nthat quarter.\n\nCosts excluded from all-in sustaining costs are non-sustaining capital\nexpenditures, non-sustaining lease payments and exploration costs, financing\ncosts, tax expense, and transaction costs associated with mergers,\nacquisitions and divestitures, and any items that are deducted for the\npurposes of adjusted earnings.\n\nSustaining Capital and Sustaining Leases\n\n\"Sustaining capital\" and \"sustaining lease\" are non-GAAP financial performance\nmeasures that do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore\nmay not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. New Gold\ndefines \"sustaining capital\" as net capital expenditures that are intended to\nmaintain operation of its gold producing assets. Similarly, a \"sustaining\nlease\" is a lease payment that is sustaining in nature. To determine\n\"sustaining capital\" expenditures, New Gold uses cash flow related to mining\ninterests from its statement of cash flows and deducts any expenditures that\nare capital expenditures to develop new operations or capital expenditures\nrelated to major projects at existing operations where these projects will\nmaterially increase production. Management uses \"sustaining capital\" and\n\"sustaining lease\", to understand the aggregate net result of the drivers of\nall-in sustaining costs other than total cash costs. These measures are\nintended to provide additional information only and should not be considered\nin isolation or as substitutes for measures of performance prepared in\naccordance with IFRS.\n\nGrowth Capital\n\n\"Growth capital\" is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that does not\nhave any standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable\nto similar measures presented by other issuers. New Gold considers non-\nsustaining capital costs to be \"growth capital\", which are capital\nexpenditures to develop new operations or capital expenditures related to\nmajor projects at existing operations where these projects will materially\nincrease production. To determine \"growth capital\" expenditures, New Gold uses\ncash flow related to mining interests from its statement of cash flows and\ndeducts any expenditures that are capital expenditures that are intended to\nmaintain operation of its gold producing assets. Management uses \"growth\ncapital\" to understand the cost to develop new operations or related to major\nprojects at existing operations where these projects will materially increase\nproduction. This measure is intended to provide additional information only\nand should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of\nperformance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n\n **Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain information contained in this news release, including any information\nrelating to New Gold's future financial or operating performance are \"forward-\nlooking\".

At\nthis point we haven't received any information that would lead to similar\nmodifications at any of our other universities,\" Peter Hans, the UNC system's\npresident, said in a written statement. \"Whether at Chapel Hill or another\ninstitution, students must continue to wear facial coverings and maintain\nsocial distancing, as their personal responsibility, particularly in off-\ncampus settings, is critical to the success of this semester and to protect\npublic health.\"\n\n_\\-- Paul Fain_\n\n* * *\n\n**UNC Chapel Hill Faculty Call Emergency Meeting After Fourth COVID Cluster**\n\n**Aug. 16, 4:41 p.m.** The Faculty Executive Committee at University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill will hold a meeting Monday to discuss the growing\nnumber of coronavirus cases after the university reported a fourth cluster of\ncases on Sunday, the Raleigh _News & Observer_\n[reported](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article245001125.html?). A\ncluster is defined as five or more cases in close proximity.\n\nThree of the announced clusters were in student housing complexes, and the\nfourth was linked to a fraternity.\n\nThe chair of the faculty, Mimi Chapman,\n[wrote](https://facultygov.unc.edu/2020/08/faculty-chair-letter-to-bog/) to\nthe UNC System Board of Governors over the weekend urging it to give UNC\nChapel Hill's chancellor authority to make decisions in response to the\npandemic.\n\n\"We knew there would be positive cases on our campus. But clusters, five or\nmore people that are connected in one place, are a different story,\" Chapman\nwrote. \"The presence of clusters should be triggering reconsideration of\nresidential, in-person learning. However, moving to remote instruction cannot\nbe done without your approval.\"\n\nClasses began at the Chapel Hill campus last week. The university opened for\nin-person classes [over the objections of the local county health\ndirector](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/08/07/covid-19-roundup-unc-\nholds-firm-reopening-hopkins-and-umass-pivot-syracuse-suspends).\n\n_\\-- Elizabeth Redden_\n\n* * *\n\n**UNC Chapel Hill Reports 2 COVID-19 Clusters**\n\n**Aug. 14, 4:32 p.m.** The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\ninformed students, faculty and staff members this afternoon that it has\nidentified two clusters of COVID-19 cases at student housing complexes.\n\nA cluster is five or more cases in close proximity within a single residential\nhall or dwelling. Those in the clusters \"are isolating and receiving medical\nmonitoring,\" according to an\n[alert](https://alertcarolina.unc.edu/notifications/2020/08/14/cases/) issued\nthis afternoon. Local health officials have been notified, and efforts are\nunder way to identify others who could have been exposed.\n\n\"All residents in these living spaces have been provided additional\ninformation about these clusters and next steps,\" the alert said. \"Contact\ntracing has been initiated with direct communication to anyone determined to\nhave been a close contact with a positive individual. A close contact is\ndefined as someone who has been within 6 feet of an infected person for more\nthan 15 minutes when either person has not been wearing a face covering. Those\nidentified as a close contact will be notified directly and provided with\nfurther guidance.\"\n\nThe clusters are at the Ehringhaus Community and Granville Towers. Ehringhaus\nhas four-bedroom suites and is heavily skewed toward first-year student\nresidents. Granville Towers are privately managed.\n\nChapel Hill's COVID-19\n[dashboard](https://carolinatogether.unc.edu/dashboard/) shows main campus\nhousing occupancy at 60.7 percent as of Monday and Granville Towers occupancy\nat 76.6 percent.\n\nThe university cited the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and\nCrime Statistics Act when issuing the alert. That act set requirements for\ndisseminating health and safety information on campus. But Chapel Hill does\nnot plan to provide details about individual positive cases, citing privacy\nconsiderations and laws.\n\nChapel Hill held its first day of classes Monday.\n\n_\\-- Rick Seltzer_\n\n* * *\n\n**Twenty-Eight COVID-19 Cases at the U. of Tennessee, Knoxville**\n\n**Aug. 13, 5:30 p.m**.

We have hit the iceberg, and we're trying to make\ndecisions of what time should we have the band play,\"\n[ESPN](https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/29653444/ncaa-medical-\nadvisers-urge-focus-pandemic-fall-sports) quoted Dr. Carlos Del Rio, executive\nassociate dean at Emory University and a member of the NCAA's COVID-19\nadvisory panel, as saying. \"We need to focus on what's important. What's\nimportant right now is we need to control this virus. Not having fall sports\nthis year, in controlling this virus, would be to me the No. 1 priority.\"\n\nMost college sports conferences have opted not to hold intercollegiate\ncompetition this fall, but several leagues that play high-profile (and high-\ndollar) football are planning to play on.\n\nDr. Colleen Kraft, an associate professor of infectious diseases at Emory and\na member of the NCAA panel, said of the leagues planning to compete: \"There\nwill be transmissions [of COVID-19], and they will have to stop their games,\"\naccording to ESPN.\n\nOfficials at the Big Ten and the Pac-12, the two leagues in the Power Five\nfootball series that have opted not to play this fall, have especially cited\nconcerns about apparently increased incidence of myocarditis, a potentially\ndeadly heart condition, related to COVID-19. The NCAA's chief medical officer,\nDr. Brian Hainline, said on the conference call that between 1 and 2 percent\nof all athletes who've been tested by NCAA members have tested positive for\nthe coronavirus, and that at least a dozen have myocarditis, ESPN reported.\n\nDr. Kraft said colleges were \"playing with fire\" regarding myocarditis.\n\n_\\-- Doug Lederman_\n\n* * *\n\n**Athletic Departments May Need 'Extraordinary Support' as Cancellations Hit\nRevenue**\n\n**Aug. 13, 12:23 p.m.** The recent spate of athletic conference decisions to\npostpone fall sports means substantial revenue shocks for college athletic\ndepartments, and cutting expenses will not always be enough to absorb the\nblow, according to a new report from Moody's Investors Service.\n\nBecause sports are strategically important for universities, Moody's expects\nuniversities to provide \"extraordinary support\" like internal loans in order\nto stay current on debt payments for athletic facilities. Colleges and\nuniversities may tap their financial reserves to close budget gaps tied to the\npandemic, the ratings agency said in a report released Thursday morning.\n\n\"Athletic expenses have grown significantly in recent years, including certain\nfixed costs such as debt service, which will impact universities' ability to\nadjust to the disruption,\" said Dennis Gephardt, vice president at Moody's, in\na statement.\n\nFall sports cancellations reached a crescendo this week when two of the most\nimportant conferences for college football, the Big Ten and the Pac-12, joined\nmany non-Power Five conferences and programs in [pulling the\nplug](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/08/12/big-ten-and-\npac-12-postpone-2020-fall-sports) on fall sports amid COVID-19 concerns.\nAlthough the Atlantic Coast Conference, Southeastern Conference and Big 12\nwere still [hoping](https://sports.yahoo.com/sec-acc-big-12-still-hoping-play-\nfootball-231414757--ncaaf.html) to play football, the ramifications of\nexisting cancellations will be felt across higher education.\n\nFootball has been the biggest driver of athletic revenue in the sector.\nFootball contributed $5.8 billion in 2018, a whopping 40 percent of the $14.6\nbillion in total athletic revenue counted by Moody's. Growth in revenue has\nbeen driven by media rights like the payments television networks make for the\nright to broadcast games.\n\nDisappearing ticket sales will also hit revenue. Although some donor support\nmight be expected to offset losses, a significant portion of donor support\ncomes from seating priority programs -- donors buying the right to pick seats\nunder certain conditions.\n\nThis situation is particularly important because the median athletic\ndepartment broke even in 2018, meaning a significant number of departments\nlost money.\n\nMoody's called that year a relatively strong revenue year. Still, more than a\nthird of Division I public universities, 37 percent, reported expenses\nexceeded revenue that year. The median operating deficit among that group was\n3 percent.\n\nConferences that generate more athletic revenue generally reported better\noperating performance than others. The financial health of operations varies\ngreatly across athletic conferences.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\n\n\"Compensation for coaches as well as other athletic support and administrative\nexpenses among NCAA Division I members make up the largest portion of the\nexpense base for a combined 35 percent and will be a focus for expense\nmanagement efforts in fiscal 2021,\" Moody's said in its note. \"With games\ncanceled, universities will save some money on game day operations and travel\nexpenses.\"\n\nAthletics requires more capital than other arms of higher education. Median\ndebt-to-operating-revenue was 58 percent for public higher education overall,\ncompared to 66 percent for institutions competing in the NCAA Division I\nFootball Bowl Subdivision. Facility expenses and debt service at Division I\npublic universities drove increases in debt between 2013 and 2018, with debt\ngrowing 54 percent in that period to a total of $2.3 billion.\n\n\"Given the revenue shocks, many athletic departments will not be able to cover\ndebt service with net revenue from recurring operations, prompting the need to\nfill the gap from appropriate auxiliary and/or other reserves. In many cases,\nthis is likely to take the form of internal loans that the athletic\ndepartments will need to repay the university over time,\" the Moody's report\nsaid.\n\nAll of this follows the cancellation of the NCAA basketball tournaments in the\nspring. Men's basketball accounted for about 15 percent of 2018 athletic\nrevenue across higher education. Women's basketball was 7 percent.\n\nStill to be determined is how the spread of COVID-19 affects sports scheduled\nfor later in the year and how universities balance pressures on athletics\nagainst pressures to other parts of their operations.\n\n\"Budget difficulties at athletic departments will add to the financial strains\nfacing universities, including a tuition revenue pinch, reduced state funding\nand incremental expenses to combat the coronavirus,\" the Moody's report said.\n\n_\\-- Rick Seltzer_\n\n* * *\n\n**Americans Are Conflicted on Colleges Reopening **\n\nA survey by Pearson finds that 77 percent of Americans think that reopening\ncolleges and universities is vital to a healthy economy.

reliable computers for demanding environments, today\nannounced that it is in continuous negotiations and has signed a letter-of-\nintent with its French authorized sales partner ID Work, with the aim of\nacquiring their operations and establishing a sales office under the JLT brand\nin the French market.\n\nA cornerstone of JLT's growth strategy is a strong sales channel consisting of\nboth internal staff and a network of authorized sales partners. Since its\nstart in 2013, the entrepreneur who founded ID Work has successfully built-up\nsales in France through a country-wide network consisting of integrators and\nresellers. Since then, the French market has grown to become one of JLT\u2019s\nlargest and most important markets in Europe. JLT's intention is to take over\nID Work\u2019s operations and establish a sales office with own personnel to get\ncloser to its customers and sales partners, and to establish a bridgehead for\nfuture expansion in Southern Europe. The entrepreneur will have a continued\ninvolvement in JLT.\n\nFor more information about JLT Mobile Computers and its rugged devices,\nservices and all-round solutions, visit\n[www.jltmobile.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=f836ArIMWRcwUM9y0QkFNYmNhBk_GU4BMX7LKQ4KebJ2vFw2L38iakYllnQg_M7kJmFCFsloLc9-3aKIQH7BJ7KyyoVQ0qFWi_x4JxYB_uM=).\nMore financial information is available on JLT's [investor\npages](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qFaPSMJ0ha8T6wbuuTs1wmBM3-u5g8_aB5FCUGr0Gho7I3lKfCjm9p1b_zK0dL7hV1hY2ePAyAzlUOKS00DP5JF7n4u8W39Ui2Qq6Y2Hp_U=).\n\n _This information is information that JLT Mobile Computers AB (pub) is\nobliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the\nSecurities Markets Act.

He was a \u201ctrough boy,\u201d and his job was to stand at one end of the\ntrough where red-hot steel pipes were dropped. Every time a pipe fell, he\npulled a lever that dumped the pipe onto a cooling bed. He was a small lad,\nand at first they hesitated to take him, but after a year on the job the\nforeman acknowledged he was the best boy they\u2019d had. Until one day when Angelo\nwas just a little too slow\u2014or perhaps the welder was a little too quick\u2014and a\nsecond pipe came out of the furnace before he had dropped the first. The one\npipe struck the other, and sent it right through Angelo\u2019s body, killing him.\nIf only he had been standing up, out of the way, instead of sitting down\u2014which\nthe day foreman told him was dangerous, but the night foreman allowed. If only\nthey had installed the guard plate before the accident, instead of after. If\nonly.\n\nAngelo was not the only casualty of the steel mills of Allegheny County,\nPennsylvania that year. In the twelve months from July 1906 through June 1907,\nten in total were killed by the operation of rolls. Twenty-two were killed by\nhot metal explosions. Five were asphyxiated by furnace gas. Thirty-one\nfatalities were attributed to the operation of the railroad at the steel\nyards, and forty-two to the operation of cranes. Twenty-four men fell from a\nheight, or into a pit. Eight died from electric shock. In all, there were 195\ncasualties in the steel mills in those twelve months, and these were just a\nportion of the total of 526 deaths from work accidents. In addition, there\nwere 509 other accidents that sent men to the hospital, at least 76 of which\nresulted in serious, permanent injury.\n\n![](https://rootsofprogress.org/img/eastman-death-calendar.jpg)[ _Work-\nAccidents and the Law,\n1910_](https://www.russellsage.org/sites/default/files/Eastman%26Kellog_Work%20Accidents_0.pdf)\n\nIn 1907, according to [a report from the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics](https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/publications/bls/bls_0234_1918.pdf),\nthe overall fatality rate in the iron and steel industry was about 220 per\n100,000 full-time workers. By 2019, however, [that rate had\nfallen](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cfoi.pdf) to only 26.3 per\n100,000, a reduction of almost 90%.\n\nThe story of workplace safety illustrates both the serious problems that\nprogress can cause, and how the solution to those problems can be found in\nfurther progress. It\u2019s a fascinating story in its own right, and in it we find\nlessons about safety in general, about liability law, and about the early\nhistory of capitalism.\n\n##  **The dangers of early factories**\n\nThe Industrial Revolution created a dramatic boost in labor productivity\nthrough mechanization, the application of power, and the institution of the\nfactory, which reorganized tasks and workers into a new mode of production.\nThis led to vastly higher growth rates in [GDP per\ncapita](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-clio-\ninfra?tab=chart&country=USA~GBR~DEU~FRA) and ultimately in [real\nwages](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/nominal-wages-consumer-prices-and-\nreal-wages-in-the-uk-since-1750?country=~GBR). But the very same\nelements\u2014factories, machines, energy\u2014created new risks that neither workers\nnor management were prepared for.\n\nThe pre-industrial world had plenty of dangerous jobs: mining for coal or\nmetals, tending a [blast furnace](https://rootsofprogress.org/iron-from-\nmythical-to-mundane), [sailing in the merchant\nmarine](https://rootsofprogress.org/navigating-the-high-seas). And of course,\ncraftsman\u2019s shops often posed risks from sharp tools or high heat (just ask\n[Johnny Tremain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Tremain)). But the\nindustrial factory brought a new set of risks.\n\nMachines had exposed blades and gears that could catch fingers and\nhands\u2014woodworking machines, especially joiners, were particularly dangerous.\nTools were powered by belts, shafts and flywheels that were similarly\nunguarded. High above the floor of the factory or mill were walkways and\nladders without railings. Cranes could knock workers dead, or drop heavy\nmaterials on them. Steam engines had high-pressure boilers, which could\nexplode. High-voltage wires threatened electrocution. Smelting furnaces posed\na risk of \u201chot-metal breakouts\u201d. And workers could be asphyxiated by toxic\ngases. Workers lost fingers, eyes, limbs, and even their lives to these\nhazards. (There were also long-term health risks from chemicals, dust\ninhalation, etc., but for now let\u2019s just consider the risk of accidents.)\n\n![](https://rootsofprogress.org/img/aldrich-injury-reenactment.jpg) _Injury\nreenactment, 1920s._[ _Aldrich p.\n78_](https://archive.org/details/safetyfirsttechn0000aldr/page/78/mode/1up?view=theater)![](https://rootsofprogress.org/img/aldrich-\ninjury-demonstration.jpg) _Demonstration of how a boy lost his arm._[ _Aldrich\np.\n85_](https://archive.org/details/safetyfirsttechn0000aldr/page/85/mode/1up?view=theater)![](https://rootsofprogress.org/img/eastman-\ngrade-crossing.jpg) _A dangerous rail crossing at grade._[ _Work-Accidents and\nthe\nLaw_](https://www.russellsage.org/sites/default/files/Eastman%26Kellog_Work%20Accidents_0.pdf)\n\nThe more power was applied, the higher the productivity of the factories, but\nalso the higher the injury rate, as heavier equipment was moving at higher\nspeeds. Safety historian Mark Aldrich writes ([p.\n165](https://archive.org/details/safetyfirsttechn0000aldr/page/165/mode/1up?view=theater))\nthat in the US from 1869 to 1927, every 1 horsepower per worker was associated\nwith as much as a 3% increase in the injury rate.\n\nThere is little in the way of statistics on accidents before the early 1900s,\nbut there is anecdotal evidence that 19th-century factories had higher injury\nrates than traditional workshops. In 1910, the New York State Compensation\nCommission wrote that \u201cprevious to the introduction of machinery into modern\nindustry, industrial accidents were relatively few and unimportant.\u201d In 1913,\nLeslie Robertson of the Ford Motor Company said that \u201cthe element of injury\nhas been ever present in an increasing ratio as modern development and methods\nhave been utilized\u201d ([Aldrich pp\n77\u201378](https://archive.org/details/safetyfirsttechn0000aldr/page/77/mode/1up?view=theater)).\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\n##  **The lack of systems thinking**\n\nThe root cause of high injury rates was a wrong fundamental attitude towards\nsafety\u2014one shared by both workers and management. Specifically, each\nindividual worker was seen as responsible for his own safety. No one\nconsidered it the job of management to provide a safe working environment.\n\nIn part, this was a holdover from the previous mode of craft production.\nCraftsmen were used to managing themselves and taking responsibility for their\nown safety. This made sense in a shop where workers used hand tools, but not\nin an industrial factory, where one worker\u2019s actions could endanger others.\nFatal accidents happened, for instance, when someone started up a machine not\nknowing that a repairman was working on it, or when a worker started a car\nalong the rails not realizing that someone was underneath it.\n\nIn addition, work was seen as inherently risky. After all, _life_ was\ninherently risky back then: sailors got [lost at\nsea](https://rootsofprogress.org/navigating-the-high-seas), poor farmers could\nstarve if struck by drought or blight, and anyone at any time could catch\n[malaria, cholera, or typhoid fever](https://rootsofprogress.org/draining-the-\nswamp). On-the-job accidents were just part of this general hazardous milieu.\n\nThus, accidents were typically attributed to worker \u201ccarelessness.\u201d Even if\npartly true, this was a dead end in terms of understanding the causes and how\nto fix them. It would not survive a modern root-cause or \u201cfive whys\u201d analysis.\nIn modern parlance, \u201csystems thinking\u201d was lacking.\n\nSince the contribution of the work environment to safety was not yet\nacknowledged, accidents were seen as largely unavoidable. Statistical thinking\nwas still in its infancy, and most people had not yet realized how it was\npossible to exercise agency in the face of rare, random events.\n\nThis mentality was reflected in liability laws of the time. It was difficult\nfor accident victims to gain suitable injury compensation from their\nemployers. Their only recourse was a lawsuit\u2014an expensive proposition, then as\nnow. Payments were often small, sometimes covering only funeral expenses, or\nnot even that. And there were multiple ways employers could escape liability.\nIf the worker had been negligent in any way, this was \u201ccontributory\nnegligence,\u201d and the employer was off the hook. By the \u201cfellow servant\u201d rule,\nif one worker\u2019s injury was the result of _another_ worker\u2019s negligence, the\nemployer was again not liable. Finally, by the doctrine of the \u201cassumption of\nrisk,\u201d the employer was not liable if the accident was considered to be within\nthe expected risks of the job. These defenses together [were known as the\n\u201cunholy trinity,\u201d](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1888620/) and\nbecause of them, [it is estimated that only one employee in\neight](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1026118/) received\ncompensation after bringing suit against their employer.\n\n##  **A new attitude**\n\nThe late 19th century saw a number of social reform movements aimed at the\nills of the factory. There was a movement to end child labor, a movement for\nshorter hours, and a movement for workplace safety.\n\nIn the US, the safety problem was thoroughly explored in a 1910 report _Work-\nAccidents and the Law,_ by Crystal Eastman (who would go on to become a\nsuffragist and a co-founder of the ACLU). The book-length report was a\nsystematic survey of every fatality and hospitalization in Allegheny County\nfrom July 1906 to June 1907. Eastman interviewed workers, foremen,\nsuperintendents, and the families of the deceased. She described the accidents\nthemselves, the general risks of the factory, and some of the preventative\nmeasures that could be taken. She presented statistics on accidents and their\ncauses. The fundamental conclusion of the report was that in the prevention of\naccidents, whether directly attributable to the employer or not, \u201cthe will of\nthe employer is pre-eminently important.\u201d Work accidents should not be\nattributed to \u201ccarelessness,\u201d but to the lack of safety provisions,\ninspections, warning systems, and training, and also to the long hours and\ngreat speed demanded of the workers.\n\nEastman\u2019s report was sober and wonkish. Another \u201cmuckraker,\u201d William Hard,\nwrote with more moral force. In a popular article titled \u201cMaking Steel and\nKilling Men,\u201d he\n[asked](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Injured_in_the_Course_of_Duty/qLA2AAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%22Must%20we%20continue%20to%20pay%20this%20price%22):\n\n> Must we continue to pay this price for the honor of leading the world in the\n> cheap and rapid production of steel and iron? Must we continue to be obliged\n> to think of scorched and scalded human beings whenever we sit on the back\n> platform of an observation car and watch the steel rails rolling out behind\n> us?\n\nSeveral states set up commissions to study the issue, and they concurred that\nthere was a serious problem. The Illinois commission\u2019s 1910 report ([p.\n19](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo1.ark:/13960/t8z89sn6s&view=1up&seq=21))\ndeclared the present system to be \u201cunjust, haphazard, inadequate and wasteful,\nthe cause of enormous suffering, of much disrespect for law and of a badly\ndistributed burden upon society.\u201d\n\nThe reformers proposed a number of different remedies. Hard thought that\nsimply requiring a public report on every accident would go a long way towards\neffecting change. Some recommended mandating specific safety practices by law,\nor granting supervisory power to public inspectors. But the key reform turned\nout to be a fundamental change in the liability law: the creation of\n\u201cworkmen\u2019s compensation.\u201d\n\nWorkers\u2019 comp is a \u201cno-fault\u201d system: rather than any attempt at a\ndetermination of responsibility, the employer is simply always liable (except\nin cases of willful misconduct). If an injury occurs on the job, the employer\nowes the worker a payment based on the injury, according to a fixed schedule.\nIn exchange, the worker no longer has the right to sue for further damages.\nThis reform was enacted first in Germany in 1884 (under Bismarck, who [is\nsaid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1888620/) to have co-opted\nit from the socialists in order to defuse their agenda), in Britain in 1897,\nand state-by-state in the US, mostly during the 1910s.\n\nThe new system benefitted both employers and workers. Workers got automatic\ncompensation. Both parties avoided costly lawsuits. Both got a more\npredictable system and better labor relations. And the system was more\nefficient, with less money being paid to lawyers and more to accident victims\nand their families.\n\nThe new system, however, dramatically increased employers\u2019 costs. The price to\na company of a fatal accident was raised from hundreds to a few thousand\ndollars, and insurance premiums increased in many cases as much as fivefold.\nMoreover, the no-fault nature of the system shifted companies\u2019 focus from\n_fighting liability,_ in the case of lawsuits, to _preventing injuries_. This\nshift is exactly what needed to happen. With this new focus and new financial\nincentive, companies began to set up safety departments, staffed by engineers.\n\nThere is a powerful effect to making a goal into someone\u2019s full-time job: it\nbecomes their identity. Safety engineering became its own subdiscipline, and\nthese engineers saw it as their professional duty to reduce injury rates. They\nbristled at the suggestion that accidents were largely unavoidable, coming to\nsuspect the opposite: that almost all accidents were avoidable, given the\nright tools, environment, and training.\n\n##  **Safety engineering**\n\nThe new corps of safety engineers began fixing the root causes of injuries.\nThey put guards and enclosures around the moving parts of machines. They\ninvented locks for the machines, so that they couldn\u2019t be turned on unless\nthose guards were in place. They created automatic shutoff mechanisms. They\nadded reversing mechanisms to machines to clear jams, so that workers wouldn\u2019t\nhave to reach in and clear them by hand. They designed power levers that pull\noutwards instead of in, so that if they are accidentally bumped, the machine\nturns off, instead of turning on. At the Ford Motor Company, safety engineers\nmade improvements to tools, then shared the blueprints with the toolmakers. In\ntime, a market for safe equipment developed, especially as procurement\ndepartments started to give preference to tools with safety features. The\nmachines began to come with guards and enclosures standard; eventually, you\ncouldn\u2019t buy tools _without_ them.\n\n![](https://rootsofprogress.org/img/eastman-lathes.jpg) _Lathes with and\nwithout guards._[ _Work-Accidents and the\nLaw_](https://www.russellsage.org/sites/default/files/Eastman%26Kellog_Work%20Accidents_0.pdf)![](https://rootsofprogress.org/img/eastman-\ncircular-saw.jpg)[ _Work-Accidents and the\nLaw_](https://www.russellsage.org/sites/default/files/Eastman%26Kellog_Work%20Accidents_0.pdf)![](https://rootsofprogress.org/img/eastman-\nguards.jpg)[ _Work-Accidents and the\nLaw_](https://www.russellsage.org/sites/default/files/Eastman%26Kellog_Work%20Accidents_0.pdf)\n\nThe engineers added railings to walkways and built viaducts for workers to\ncross tracks (rather than crossing them at grade). They added more clearance\naround machines and rails. They redesigned and rebuilt blast furnaces\nstronger, to prevent hot-metal breakouts. They found safer chemicals to\nsubstitute for dangerous ones such as ammonia. They designed safety apparel:\nsafety glasses, protective gloves and leggings, hard hats, steel-toed shoes.\n\nElectrification in particular was a boon, not only to safety but to factory\nworking conditions in general. Brighter lighting made it easier to see\nhazards, and getting rid of candles, oil lamps, and gas light reduced smells,\nfumes, and the risk of fire. Electric motors eliminated the shafts, belts,\npulleys and flywheels that had previously distributed power, all of which\ncould trap arms, clothing and hair. No flywheel also meant that a machine\ncould stop immediately rather than taking time to spin down. And electricity\nallowed the factory to be completely reorganized: no longer confined to the\nline of the central power shaft, machines could be arranged to optimize the\nflow of materials. This minimized handling, which improved both productivity\nand safety.\n\nEqually important to these engineering fixes were education and training for\nthe workers. First came simple awareness: you can help prevent accidents.\nWorkers had to be encouraged to use the new safety features of their machines,\nand not to circumvent them for convenience. Propaganda campaigns were\nlaunched, including cartoons featuring the misadventures of characters such as\n\u201cWillie Everlearn\u201d and \u201cOtto Nobetter.\u201d Safety contests were held, with teams\ncompeting for who could reduce injury rates the most. Eventually, as best\npractices were determined, workers were trained in specific procedures.\nAldrich writes ([p.\n133](https://archive.org/details/safetyfirsttechn0000aldr/page/133/mode/1up?view=theater)):\n\n> There were safe ways to pile materials, safe places to stand while dressing\n> drive belts, safe methods of placing ladders and of climbing down them, safe\n> methods of lifting, safe ways to sharpen a knife, safe ways to attach a\n> lifting hook, open a fire door, feed a saw, tighten a nut, rig a gangway,\n> lift a load, and move a cart.\n\n![](https://rootsofprogress.org/img/otto-nobetter.jpg) _National Safety\nCouncil poster, 1920s._[ _Aldrich, p.\n138_](https://archive.org/details/safetyfirsttechn0000aldr/page/138/mode/1up?view=theater)\n\nCompanies also established or upgraded on-site medical care. A factory doctor\ncould attend to injuries right away; this not only sped care, but also kept\nemployees from ignoring minor injuries, or trying to apply ineffective or even\nharmful self-remedies. Regular checkups also helped: it was discovered that\nsome workers had medical conditions, and should be placed in less physically\ndemanding roles; many others were found to need glasses, and better eyesight\nimproved safety.\n\nUnderlying all this was scientific investigation. The US Bureau of Labor\nStatistics began collecting accident statistics and producing reports. It was\nobserved that accident rates were higher among new employees\u2014one steel company\nfound that employees with less than 30 days experience had accidents at twelve\ntimes the company average\u2014which drove home the importance of training for new\nhires. Injuries were investigated and their root causes determined\u2014no longer\nwould accidents be chalked up to \u201ccarelessness.\u201d Line workers were included on\nthe accident investigation committees, to ensure trust and buy-in. The private\nNational Safety Council was created to serve as a clearinghouse of\ninformation.\n\nInsurance companies played an important role in all of this. Since they\nultimately paid for accidents, they had a strong financial incentive to\nprevent them and reduce their cost. By serving many clients, they had a\nbroader range of experience than all but the largest manufacturing firms. Some\nof them specialized in particular industries, which let them determine best\npractices and encourage or enforce them via factory inspections. They\nperformed their own safety research, published their own pamphlets, and even\nset up their own medical practices.\n\nAll this work paid off: In the early decades of the 1900s, injury rates in\nmany US industries fell dramatically. Data from this period is spotty, but\nhere are figures for injuries per million man-hours from a few different\nindustries, plus the DuPont chemical company (from [Aldrich, appendix\n3](https://archive.org/details/safetyfirsttechn0000aldr/page/309/mode/1up?view=theater)):\n\n | Time period| Start| End| Reduction  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nSteel| 1907 \u2192 1939| 80.8| 9.7| 88%  \nPortland cement| 1909 \u2192 1939| 97.0| 4.3| 96%  \nPaper and pulp| 1920 \u2192 1939| 46.3| 15.2| 67%  \nDuPont| 1912 \u2192 1937| 43.2| 1.9| 96%  \n  \nNot all of this reduction is directly attributable to the safety departments;\nsome of it is due to lower turnover and a decline in hours worked per week.\nControlling for these factors, however, Aldrich still estimates ([p.\n164](https://archive.org/details/safetyfirsttechn0000aldr/page/164/mode/1up?view=theater))\nthat safety technology and practices reduced injury rates 3.7%/year from\n1926\u201345, for a total reduction of about 50% over that period.\n\n##  **Safety was led top-down**\n\nOne striking aspect of the story is that the workers themselves were\nremarkably unconcerned with safety issues. Safety was led top-down, by\nmanagement.\n\nSafety did not show up on surveys of US workers\u2019 concerns in the 1800s. Their\nstrikes were almost never motivated by safety issues: in the building and coal\ntrades, across over 50,000 recorded strikes for hundreds of different reasons\nin the last two decades of the 19th century, there were many thousands over\nbetter pay, but only _eleven_ strikes directly due to safety issues. In the\ncoal industry, there were also at least six strikes _against_ safety measures\n(five to oppose a new safety lamp, and one to allow smoking in the coal mine\nduring lunch). ([Aldrich p.\n90](https://archive.org/details/safetyfirsttechn0000aldr/page/90/mode/1up?view=theater))\n\nWhen safety measures were introduced, workers had to be encouraged, trained,\ncoaxed, and propagandized to use them. They often resisted new measures at\nfirst. Aldrich writes ([p.\n136](https://archive.org/details/safetyfirsttechn0000aldr/page/136/mode/1up?view=theater)):\n\n> The new rules and equipment also represented a loss of workers\u2019 control over\n> their work lives. \u2026 \u201cthe old-timers disliked being told how to do a job\n> without being hurt. Their idea was that someone had to get hurt,\n> occasionally.\u201d In addition, danger was manly. \u2026 \u201cthe fellow who wasn\u2019t\n> willing to risk his safety was looked on in modern terms as a sissy.\u201d\n\nFurther, the safety movement was led by large companies, not small ones. Some\nof the first safety programs, even before the new liability laws, were\nestablished at big companies like US Steel or DuPont. One reason for this is\nthat large companies were the most visible, and had the most to lose from bad\npublicity. Another is that they had the resources to invest in safety\ndepartments and safety engineering programs. There was also a technical reason\nhaving to do with insurance: Large companies would be self-insured against\nworkers\u2019 comp claims; small ones would purchase insurance. However, the\ninsurance premiums sometimes depended only on the company\u2019s industry, giving\nthem no incentive to improve. (This was ultimately addressed by making\npremiums partly dependent on an employer\u2019s track record, and by giving premium\ndiscounts for instituting specific safety measures.)\n\nA lesson I draw from this is that the average person has a hard time thinking\nabout risk. Workers saw the small daily cost\u2014guards and enclosures on machines\nare inconvenient, hard hats and safety goggles are uncomfortable and\nunattractive\u2014and weren\u2019t keenly aware of the rare disaster that would be\naverted. This kind of statistical thinking just doesn\u2019t come naturally to\npeople. (No wonder so many people don\u2019t want to get vaccinated, even against\ndeadly pandemic diseases.)\n\nMy conclusion is that safety goals will rarely if ever be driven bottom-up.\nThey are much more likely to be driven top-down, by someone in a position of\nleadership or authority who sees the statistical picture and can implement the\nsystematic change, including education and training, needed to make it happen.\n\n##  **The unreasonable effectiveness of liability law**\n\nI was also impressed with how a simple and effective change to the law set in\nmotion an entire apparatus of management and engineering decisions that\nresulted in the creation of a new safety culture. It\u2019s a case study of a\nclassic attitude from economics: just put a price on the harm\u2014internalize the\nexternality\u2014and let the market do the rest.\n\nTo be clear, part of the reason that so much of the improvement in factory\nsafety can be credited to workers\u2019 compensation is that such regulation as did\nexist was ineffective. In part, this was due to lack of enforcement support\n(states typically had fewer than one inspector per thousand shops); in part,\nmanufacturers were often acquitted by juries of their peers. But these very\ndifficulties just highlight the elegance of the liability solution, under\nwhich trials were eliminated, and the inspectors were funded by the insurance\ncompanies. In any case, it seems to have led to a better outcome than I can\nimagine being legislated by fiat or micromanaged by regulatory bodies. Aldrich\nnotes ([p.\n101](https://archive.org/details/safetyfirsttechn0000aldr/page/101/mode/1up?view=theater))\nthat \u201cit proved virtually impossible to write laws that were specific enough\nto be enforceable and yet flexible enough to fit a broad range of industrial\nconditions, while technical change often made laws obsolete shortly after they\nwere written.\u201d\n\nIncidentally, Aldrich mentions ([p.\n132](https://archive.org/details/safetyfirsttechn0000aldr/page/132/mode/1up?view=theater))\nthat:\n\n> \u2026 the European safety movement had begun with strict requirements for\n> machine guarding, which focused employers\u2019 interests on complying with the\n> law instead of preventing injuries. In the US, on the other hand, the\n> ineffectiveness of early state legislation combined with the spread of\n> workmen\u2019s compensation encouraged businesses to see safety in business\n> terms, not legal terms, and to seek out cost-effective means to prevent\n> injuries.\n\nI don\u2019t yet know whether and how Europe\u2019s outcomes differed from the US. This\nis an intriguing line for future research.\n\nA related lesson is how much it matters to get the details of the law right.\nIn theory, employers were always liable for injuries. But the old law didn\u2019t\ngive them enough liability, enough of the time, and made it too difficult for\nworkers to seek redress. Workers\u2019 comp dramatically simplified and streamlined\nthe process. In practice, it made the difference between workers getting\ncompensation and not. While it might seem important to make an accurate\ndetermination of fault, it turns out that it\u2019s more important to have\nsimplicity, predictability, and low overhead\u2014especially because of the\nincentives that liability battles put in place. Indeed, I am starting to look\nwith suspicion on any system in which individual workers or consumers have to\nfile a lawsuit to receive compensation.\n\nThe system seems so effective that I now wonder where else we could apply\nsimilar models. For instance, what if we got rid of medical malpractice\nlawsuits in favor of a no-fault system in which the medical provider always\npays for any complication arising under their care? Maybe this would shift the\nfocus of doctors and hospitals from avoiding liability and following\nbureaucratic rules, to actually preventing medical accidents in the most\neffective and efficient manner possible.\n\n##  **Narrative violation?**\n\nThere is a traditional anti-capitalist narrative of industrial history that\ngoes like this: In the early Industrial Revolution, greedy capitalists who put\nprofits over people exploited powerless workers\u2014even women and children\u2014by\nmaking them work long hours at arduous jobs in dim, dirty, smelly, dangerous\nfactories. Callous and heartless, they squeezed every penny of profit out of\nthe helpless workers. Then, heroic social reformers came along and brought the\ncapitalists to heel, empowering the worker and rescuing them from their\nplight. Reformers gave workers the 40-hour week, eliminated child labor, and\nbrought safety and hygiene to factories.\n\nAnother narrative might go like this: Actually, the historical progression was\nnatural and inevitable. Shorter hours, cleaner and safer factories, and the\nend of child labor are luxuries that could only happen after an increase in\nper-capita wealth. These things go through a kind of Kuznets curve, naturally\ngetting worse in the early stages of economic growth, then getting better\nlater. The factory system, including its harsh discipline, was needed to pull\nthe pre-industrial world out of the poverty it had been mired in for millenia.\nIn this telling, there\u2019s no way the problems could have been avoided in the\nearly period\u2014and their solution was natural and inevitable in the later\nperiod. It was economic progress itself, not muckrakers and labor unions, that\nsolved them.\n\nWhich narrative, if either, is bolstered by the story of factory safety? Let\u2019s\nexplore this through a dialogue between Paul the Progressive and Carla the\nCapitalist:\n\n **P:** The history of workplace injuries shows the evil of capitalism and the\nneed for progressive reform.\n\n **C:** No, it shows no such thing!\n\n **P:** Capitalist factories had very high injury rates, and management didn\u2019t\ncare. It was only after progressive reformers called attention to the problem\nand got the law changed that things improved!\n\n **C:** No, the dangerous factory environment was the result of attitudes left\nover from the previous age. Workers themselves were unconcerned for their own\nsafety\u2014they often resisted safety measures, and even struck against them! And\nno one knew exactly what safety measures were needed, anyway\u2014that required a\nprocess of investigation and engineering. The whole thing was a natural\nprogression of error and learning, made possible by surplus wealth. Safety is\na luxury that we purchased once we were rich enough.\n\n **P:** Sure, some learning was needed\u2014but it could have happened faster. US\nfactories were still highly dangerous in 1910, many decades into the\nIndustrial Revolution, and decades after liability reform had already happened\nin Europe. There were obvious safety measures that could have been taken, and\nweren\u2019t. Management could have put resources into this, but didn\u2019t\u2014until it\nhurt their pocketbooks. They just didn\u2019t care about the workers.\n\n **C:** Were the safety measures really _obvious?_ They look that way in\nretrospect, but it\u2019s always obvious _after_ an accident happens; it\u2019s much\nharder to tell, with finite resources, what _preventative_ measures you should\ntake. And your theory that management didn\u2019t care doesn\u2019t fit with the fact\nthat it was actually the biggest companies who led the way in safety. Are you\ntrying to tell me that big bureaucracies care more about their workers on a\npersonal level than small shops?\n\n **P:** Fine. There\u2019s no need to get personal and blame \u201cheartless\nmanagement\u201d. This isn\u2019t the moral failing of any individual, but of a\n_system_. Even if it wasn\u2019t obvious which specific safety measures to take, it\nshould have been obvious that the factory was too dangerous\u2014that much was\nclear to the public once the reformers put a spotlight on the issues.\n\n **C:** Sure, but some danger is inherent in work, and the _world_ was a\ndangerous place in the 19th century. Capitalism didn\u2019t invent danger\u2014mining\nand logging were plenty dangerous well before the Industrial Revolution.\nBesides, ultimately, businesses respond to incentives. The law tells them\ntheir responsibilities, and they don\u2019t have an obligation to go above and\nbeyond that. In fact, if they do, they might fail in competition to those who\nare more efficient.\n\n **P:** I agree: businesses respond to incentives, and they do only the bare\nminimum the law requires, no more! That is exactly my point: capitalism gives\nthem _powerful and dangerous_ incentives, which increase real wages, but at a\nterrible and deadly cost. That\u2019s exactly why corporations need to be reined in\nby laws that protect workers.\n\n **C:** Well, I agree that capitalism rests on a legal foundation that\nincludes protecting people\u2019s rights! What we had here was a case where the law\nfailed, in practice, to protect the right not to be injured through the\nnegligence of others. That\u2019s why legal reform was needed. The problem here\nwasn\u2019t capitalism, it was the inadequate protection for certain rights\u2014\n_human_ rights that apply to everyone, not special \u201cworkers\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\n **P:** It\u2019s fine for you to say that now, with the benefit of hindsight. But\nit was all too easy, back then, for people to defend the status quo by saying\nthat workers\u2019 rights _were_ protected, by the existing liability laws. It was\neasy to argue against workers\u2019 comp on the grounds that not all injuries were\nthe employer\u2019s fault. And it was easy to claim that employers and workers had\nagreed to a job with known risks, and that it\u2019s not the place of the law to\ntell people what risks they should be willing to accept for what reward. So\neven if you can frame this as a simple issue of liability in retrospect, the\nreform would never have happened except for people who cared deeply for\nsomething they call \u201cworkers\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\n **C:** You\u2019re right about how easy it was to defend the status quo on\nseemingly reasonable grounds. But that doesn\u2019t mean we have to start viewing\nthe world through the lens of class warfare. This was simply a case where\nsystems thinking was required, to understand that accidents should be\nattributed to the work environment rather than to individual \u201ccarelessness.\u201d\nAnd where the mechanism of the law needed to be streamlined, to avoid costly\nlawsuits.\n\n **P:** Maybe\u2026 but employers also argued that workers had accepted the risks\nof the job. Under your laissez-faire principles, the worker has the \u201cright\u201d to\nsign a contract in which he assumes any level of risk. Indeed, this was known\nat the time as the \u201cright to die!\u201d\n\n **C:** No, you can\u2019t sign away _all_ your rights. You can\u2019t sell yourself\ninto slavery, for instance. Perhaps on a similar principle, you can\u2019t agree to\nwaive all compensation for injury.\n\n **P:** Great, I\u2019ll see you and raise you: you can\u2019t agree to waive your right\nto a living wage, shorter hours, etc.\u2026 apparently the whole progressive agenda\ncan be built on your laissez-faire foundation!\n\n **C:** No, now you\u2019re not talking about injury, but benefits. You\u2019ve flipped\nfrom negative rights, the right not to be injured, to so-called \u201cpositive\nrights\u201d, such as pay and convenient hours. I still say those issues should be\ndecided on the free market, not through intrusive, paternalistic government\nregulation.\n\n **P:** Well, I\u2019d love to debate you on that point, but let\u2019s stay focused on\nsafety for now. I\u2019ll agree that _some_ initial rise in accident rate might\nhave been inevitable in the transition to a new mode of production. But the\nsafety movement was not inevitable\u2014it was the result of progressive reformers.\nCapitalism would never have accomplished this on its own.\n\n **C:** Well\u2026 I have to admit, reformers like Eastman and Hard seem\ninstrumental in this story. Their work helped bring about the legal reform,\nand the legal reform brought about the safety departments. So, I have to give\nthem credit for that.\n\n **P:** Good.\n\n **C:** Honestly, I just bristle at most muckrakers because they\u2019re so hostile\nto business\u2014you know, the caricature they paint of the evil greedy heartless\ncapitalist. Still, if we\u2019re being intellectually honest, we have to face the\nbrutal reality of the problems that progress has created, even as we remain\noptimistic about our ability to solve them with more progress\u2014[the\n\u201csolutionist\u201d\nmentality](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/13/1028295/proud-\nsolutionist-history-technology-industry/).

If you take the job at 20 hours/day, you know\nwhat you've signed up for. You didn't sign up to be injured in an accident.\nThe liability for that needs to fall somewhere.\n\n(You could argue that workers signed up for certain risks, and this is exactly\nwhat employers used to argue in many cases. And I'm not 100% sure that's\nwrong. So I am still slightly ambivalent about this.)\n\nReply\n\n[-][Said Achmiz](/users/saidachmiz)[1h ](/posts/DQKgYhEYP86PLW7tZ/how-\nfactories-were-made-safe?commentId=9E6DKr7aMZTG94mcF)4\n\n> In 1907, according to a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the\n> overall fatality rate in the iron and steel industry was about 220 per\n> 100,000 full-time workers.

However, they\nhad to be specifically advocated for by individuals and groups who supported\nthem. I'm not familiar with the specific laws, but at least the German\nworker's compensation law originated with a socialist group and was introduced\nto placate workers. In other countries, I'm doubtful that it was the companies\nwho would have to pay significantly more afterward who supported the laws.\n\nOne of the benefits of an organization like a labor union is that it can be a\ntop-down (or at least collectively organized) organization that advocates for\nlaws like these that _make sense_ but not from the perspective of any\nindividual business owner or worker.\n\nReply\n\n[-][jasoncrawford](/users/jasoncrawford)[12h ](/posts/DQKgYhEYP86PLW7tZ/how-\nfactories-were-made-safe?commentId=pPc3vMfkoGzHFLft8)4\n\nDid you read all the way to the end? I feel this was addressed in the last few\nparagraphs.\n\n(Incidentally, many if not most businesses were in favor of the workers' comp\nlaw, even though they knew it would raise their costs. In part that was\nbecause they thought it would improve labor relations, although it also may\nhave been because they thought some reform was inevitable and they wanted\nsomething moderate to pass before something radical came along. Re labor\nunions, many of them were actually against workers' comp at first, although\nSamuel Gompers of the AFL then changed his mind and became for it.)\n\nReply\n\n[-][gbear605](/users/gbear605)[11h ](/posts/DQKgYhEYP86PLW7tZ/how-factories-\nwere-made-safe?commentId=Mv88M4PEKtjpkmnPF)1\n\nI did, and I appreciated that you (to the extent you identify with Carla the\nCapitalist) gave thanks to the people who you oppose ideologically but\nappreciate for their results anyway.\n\nAgain, I'm woefully uninformed about the history here, but: It sounds like\nthere was support for something that would solve the issues but was more\nradical than workers comp (and presumably wouldn't include the short term pain\nfor workers, and perhaps would be worse overall because of it). If workers\ncomp wound up being a middle ground that all sides would accept then it seems\ndisingenuous to discount worker support for a more radical solution when the\ncompromise worked. Of course, if that's an inaccurate view of the history and\nthe workers and their advocates were really just poorly educated and\nmisinformed about safety, let's hope that they're more informed in our modern\nday and on other issues.\n\nReply\n\n[-][jasoncrawford](/users/jasoncrawford)[8h ](/posts/DQKgYhEYP86PLW7tZ/how-\nfactories-were-made-safe?commentId=rCRHts7XRzHKZzYyT)2\n\nI'm not sure if there was a _specific_ more-radical proposal on the table, or\nif that was just a general concern of the businesses. If there was one, I\nhaven't encountered it.\n\nAgain, the labor unions actually were originally for the less-radical proposal\nof simply reforming the tort system (taking away some employer protections)\nwithout going all the way to a no-fault system.\n\nThe workers themselves seem mostly focused on pay, hours, and other more\ntangible things.\n\nReply\n\n[-][Andrew Vlahos](/users/andrew-vlahos)[16h ](/posts/DQKgYhEYP86PLW7tZ/how-\nfactories-were-made-safe?commentId=r5w7jasA3BeJvpDCE)1\n\nNot really helpful for understanding the history of factory safety, but here's\na funny German workplace safety video, Forklift Driver Klaus: (note, you do\nnot need to speak german)\n\nReply\n\n[-][gwern](/users/gwern)[16h ](/posts/DQKgYhEYP86PLW7tZ/how-factories-were-\nmade-safe?commentId=CyggLmtatrPmYF6Jy)2\n\nIt's a great video.

Seals Deal With Arcelor Mittal\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n11 September 2021\n\n[ The New Republic Liberia (Monrovia)  ](http://newrepublicliberia.com/ \"Visit\nThe New Republic Liberia \\(Monrovia\\)\")\n\n_...promises to increase production_\n\nThe Liberian government and Arcelor Mittal, the world's largest steel company\non Friday sealed another 25years Mineral Development Agreement-MDA .\n\nThe ceremony was witnessed by president George Weah and Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal,\nExecutive Chairman of Arcelor Mittal said.\n\nThe new agreement if ratified by the legislature, will enable the company to\ninvest US$800M. Already, the company's first 25 years agreement(signed in\n2005) has nine more years remaining.\n\nThe new agreement means it will triple its iron ore production. \"Our\ncommitment is very strong. We will be expanding our mining operations - in the\nfirst phase tripling our current production levels to 15 million tonnes a\nyear,\" Mittal said.\n\nMittal continued: \"We are also exploring the potential to go beyond that - up\nto 30 million tonnes a year. The product will also be higher quality and to\ndeliver this premium quality we will be constructing a new concentration plant\n- with the first concentrate expected in late 2023.\".\n\nArcelor Mittal first signed a 25-year deal with Liberia in 2005 and shipped\nthe first iron ore from its Yekepa mine in 2011.\n\nMany people from the operation areas have expressed their unhappiness over the\nperformance. This led to a strike action which resulted into the burning of\nsome of equipment and subsequent arrest during the regime of former president\n, madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.\n\nThe resumption of president Weah's government led to a call for renegotiation\nwhich lasted for two years. For instance, the government said there was need\nto ensure the multiple track use of the rail road; which will enable other\ncompanies to transshipment from neighboring Guinea into the port city of\nBuchanan.\n\n__ Close\n\n![](https://cdn07.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-\ntext-128x128.png)\n\n#### Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters\n\nGet the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\n\nTop HeadlinesLiberiaLegal AffairsMining\n\nSubmit\n\nBy submitting above, you agree to [our privacy\npolicy](/misc/info/privacy.html).\n\n####  __Success!\n\nAlmost finished...\n\nWe need to confirm your email address.\n\nTo complete the process, please follow the instructions in the email we just\nsent you.\n\n####  __Error!\n\n####  __Error!\n\nThere was a problem processing your submission.

But, ultimately, we hope that it is the people of Liberia that will\nbenefit most from this agreement.\n\nThe expansion of our operations is expected to generate thousands of jobs for\nthe local population during the construction and operating phases.\"\n\n_Read the[ **original article**](https://www.newrepublicliberia.com/gov-seals-\ndeal-with-arcelor-mittal/) on [**New\nRepublic**](http://newrepublicliberia.com/ \"Visit New Republic\")._\n\nTagged:\n\n  * [Liberia](/liberia/)\n  * [West Africa](/westafrica/)\n  * [Business](/business/)\n  * [Legal Affairs](/legalaffairs/)\n  * [Mining](/mining/)\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[Copyright](https://allafrica.com/misc/info/copyright.html) (C) 2021 [The New\nRepublic Liberia](http://newrepublicliberia.com/).

(TSX:YRI;\nNYSE:AUY; LSE:AUY) (\u201cYamana\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) today announced positive\ninitial drill results at its Wasamac project in the Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue\nRegion of Quebec, Canada, confirming the presence of the Wasa Shear zone to\nthe west of the main Wasamac zone and expanding the down-dip continuity of the\nWasa Shear in a secondary zone known as Wildcat. These initial results further\nalign with the objective to sustain 200,000 ounces per year of production at\nWasamac and achieve a strategic mine life of more than 15 years, which, in\nturn, aligns with the potential to increase the Company\u2019s average annual\nproduction in Quebec to approximately 500,000 ounces by 2028 through 2041.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsistent with the optimization strategy announced with the positive\ndevelopment decision on Wasamac on July 19, 2021, the Company is advancing an\nexploration program that focuses on expanding the current mineral resource\nenvelopes to depths below the established mineral resource and testing for\nmineralization in poorly explored gaps between mineralized zones. In addition,\nthe exploration program will target the broader Wasamac property, including\nthe adjacent Francoeur, Arntfield and Lac Fortune gold deposits (\u201cthe\nFrancoeur properties\u201d), and include an infill program to better delineate\nmining areas expected to be developed in the first three years of production.\n\nThe Company today also provided an update on its generative exploration\nprogram, announcing the discovery of a high-grade gold-copper zone at the\nLavra Velha project in Brazil and the expansion of massive sulphide copper,\ngold, and zinc mineralization over a greater than two-kilometre strike length\nat the Borborema project in Brazil.\n\nThe generative exploration program is a key component of Yamana\u2019s overall\norganic growth strategy, designed to advance the Company\u2019s most prospective\nproperties and lay the foundation for the next generation of Yamana mines. The\nCompany\u2019s generative work is focused on its large land positions in mining-\nfriendly jurisdictions in the Americas where Yamana already has producing\nmines and deep technical, geological, and operational expertise. This allows\nfor the rapid advancement of the Company\u2019s highest value projects while at the\nsame time moving the most promising early-stage properties up the exploration\npipeline. The generative exploration program thus complements and leverages\nfrom the low-capital organic growth strategy of the Company, which delivers\nreturns on investment while providing for future production growth at the\nCompany\u2019s existing operations and advancing projects.\n\nThe main objectives of the generative program are to add new inferred mineral\nresources of at least 1.5 million ounces of gold equivalent and on a longer-\nterm basis advance at least one project to a mineral inventory that is large\nenough to support a mine plan demonstrating positive economics with annual\ngold production of 150,000 ounces per year for at least eight years. Projects\nare categorized as Tier One, Tier Two, or Tier Three projects, which are\ndefined as follows:  \n\nTier One\n\n|\n\nProjects with well-defined gold mineral resources and opportunities to grow to\na potentially economic threshold in the next three years  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nTier Two\n\n|\n\nProjects that have achieved significant drill intercepts and whose geology\nalong with other factors support rapid mineral resource growth  \n  \nTier Three\n\n|\n\nHighly prospective projects with known mineralization defined with rock and\nsoil geochemistry that warrant future drill testing  \n  \nWhile the generative program continues to show significant progress,\nexploration activities only began to ramp up later in 2021 as a result of\ndelays due to COVID-19 in 2020 and early 2021. While this delay may result in\nthe deferral of the initial three-year timeline to achieve new inferred\nmineral resources of at least 1.5 million ounces of gold equivalent for some\nprojects in the generative exploration program, the Company continues to\nprioritize projects that demonstrate the best potential for more rapid\nadvancement to a standalone operation that meets the Company\u2019s long-term\nobjectives. Highlighted herein are those projects that have made the most\nsubstantive advances during the past year, including the introduction of two\nnew projects to the program where ongoing surface exploration has shown\npromising results: the Falcon project, a Tier 2 project in Santa Cruz,\nArgentina; and Las Flechas, a Tier 3 project in San Juan, Argentina.\n\nAll projects in the generative program compete for exploration funding and, as\nnoted above, the Company prioritizes projects that have the best chance of\nadvancing rapidly to a development phase. The generative program currently\nincludes Lavra Velha at a Tier 1 level. Lavra Velha is the most advanced\nproject with an inferred mineral resource that contains significant oxide\nmineralization and a large land position, which indicate strong potential to\nadvance towards development. The Company believes that Lavra Velha has the\nhighest prospect of advancing quickly through the evaluation and development\nphases with lower capital costs. While Monument Bay is another Tier 1 project,\nit has not advanced as rapidly as Lavra Velha as a result of the above-\nmentioned delays although the Company continues to evaluate the long-term\npotential of Monument Bay as an open pit operation, as originally\ncontemplated, relying on the existing mineral resources, although also as a\nhigher-grade underground deposit with deeper drilling targeting high-grade\nmineralized shoots.\n\n **Highlights, Wasamac**\n\n  *  **Wasamac** (Quebec, Canada). The Company commenced an aggressive exploration drilling program early in 2021 to expand the mineral resource envelope and test exploration targets to depth in poorly tested areas of the Wasa Shear zone.\n\n  * Drill testing in the second quarter of 2021 confirmed the presence of the Wasa Shear zone west towards the Horne Creek fault. Further drill testing is ongoing.\n\n  * Initial exploratory step out drilling in the Wildcat zone, a historic shaft and area of past exploration located approximately 300 metres south of the Wasa Shear, expanded the down-dip continuity of the known historic zones that are not included in the current mineral reserve or mineral resource, underscoring the potential for zones with higher grades to increase future production and extend mine life.\n\n    * Preliminary results from the Wildcat zone include the following estimated true width intercepts: 3.84 grams per tonne (\u201cg/t\u201d) of gold over 13.25 metres, including 6.40 g/t of gold over 7.10 metres (WS-21-508); 13.03 g/t of gold over 3.16 metres(WS-21-509); and 5.02 g/t of gold over 11.02 metres, including 10.93 g/t of gold over 2.20 metres, and including 4.47 g/t of gold over 6.57 metres (WS-21-511).\n\n  * Within the greater Wasamac\u2013Francoeur properties, compilation work is underway to develop and rank new targets. Supporting activity includes the merging and interpretation of high-resolution airborne magnetics that now cover the entire property package.\n\n  * Yamana has received the required permits to begin an extensive infill and exploration program on the main Wasamac orebodies. Infill drilling will begin this month and accelerate with additional drills being added over the next two months.\n\n  * The initial drilling results reinforce the Company\u2019s vision for a 200,000-ounce-plus per year operation with a mine life of at least 15 years.\n\n **Highlights, Generative Program**\n\n **Tier 1**\n\n  *  **Lavra Velha** (Bahia, Brazil). Exploratory drilling below Lavra Velha recently identified zones of high-grade gold-copper mineralization associated with potassic alteration below the near surface mineralized zones.\n\n    * Drilling highlights include the following estimated true width intercepts: 5.49 g/t of gold and 2.49% of copper over 7.85 metres, and 4.56 g/t of gold over 1.02 metres within a wider, 13.50 metre interval, grading 1.89 g/t of gold (FSW00025). Drilling of both the deeper sulphide mineralization and further near surface oxide targets is ongoing.\n\n  * Significant new property acquisitions in 2021 have expanded the property to the southwest, with excellent surface geochemical results for copper and gold, generating new drill targets in this extensive mineralized district.  \n  \n\n  *  **Monument Bay** (Manitoba, Canada). Drilling in 2021 has successfully intercepted the mineralized zone at depth with promising results from the Camp and Lake shoots.   \n\n    * Results include estimated true width intercepts: 2.27 metres grading 7.48 g/t of gold, with 0.39 metres at 29.00 g/t of gold (TL-21-727B); and 6.52 g/t gold over 2.22 metres, within a wider true width interval of 9.73 metres grading 2.34 g/t of gold (TL 21-732).\n\n **Tier 2**\n\n  *  **Borborema** (Pernambuco, Brazil). Drilling completed on the high-grade S\u00e3o Francisco target returned further positive results defining a mineralized corridor 2.3 kilometres in length.\n\n    * Drilling highlights include the following core length intercepts: 0.26% of copper over 40.15 metres, including 1.02% of copper over 5.16 metres (SF-026); and 0.20 g/t of gold, 1.81% of copper and 0.19% of zinc over 5.00 metres (SF-020).\n\n  * Drill holes SF-020 and SF-026 are located approximately 1.5 kilometres apart along strike, with the intervening strike length untested. A planned high-resolution airborne geophysical survey and further geochemical sampling in the current year are expected to significantly advance existing targets and identify new gold and polymetallic targets for drill testing on this highly prospective property.   \n  \n\n  * **Jacobina Norte** (Bahia, Brazil). Drilling is limited to date but extensive surface work has defined six-kilometre-long sector of conglomerates that contain significant surface gold mineralization over 1.00 g/t gold, suggesting excellent potential for the discovery of a standalone Jacobina-type system.   \n  \n\n  * **Falcon** (Santa Cruz, Argentina). Previous drilling intercepted significant low-grade mineralization over wide widths from surface, and ongoing surface work has defined a gold-in-soil anomaly (more than 25 parts per billion gold) over 1,300-by-500 metres as well as a second parallel zone that has returned significant gold-in-rock samples along a 1.2 kilometre trend. The property, located near the Company\u2019s Cerro Moro operation, demonstrates significant geological potential.  \n\n **Tier 3**\n\n  *  **Las Flechas** (San Juan, Argentina). Located along the Central Andean Miocene volcanic belt of Chile-Argentina, one of the most prolific geological environments globally for large gold and copper systems, and host to several major gold and gold-copper mines and deposits. The style of mineralization evident at Las Flechas is consistent with a large Miocene epithermal to porphyry gold copper system. Ongoing work has identified new potential sectors with good surface results for gold-in-rock and soil sampling, defining new drill targets.   \n  \n\n  * **Colider** (Mato Grosso, Brazil). Preliminary results at Colider are supportive of a fertile geological system with the potential to host epithermal and porphyry type deposits. Surface work has been completed and preliminary drill testing will be completed before year-end 2021.  \n\n **Figure 1: Project Location Map.  \n**<https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/43dc3222-bbfe-416d-97b4-7418198358ef>\n\n **Wasamac**\n\nWasamac is a development-stage underground gold project located 15 kilometres\nwest of Rouyn-Noranda in the prolific Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue region of the\nmining-friendly province of Quebec. The project is well located, adjacent to\nthe Trans-Canada highway and Ontario Northland rail line and 100 kilometres\nwest of the Company\u2019s 50%-owned Canadian Malartic mine. The project has proven\nand probable mineral reserves of 1.91 million ounces of gold at an average\ngold grade of 2.56 g/t, with expected average annual production of 169,000\nounces of gold over an initial mine life of 10 years, and 200,000 ounces per\nyear over four years after ramp-up. The Company announced a positive\ndevelopment decision on Wasamac on July 19, 2021. (Please see the press\nrelease titled \u2018Yamana Gold Announces Positive Development Decision on its\nWholly-Owned Wasamac Project\u2019, available at\n[www.yamana.com](http://www.yamana.com)).\n\nThe Wasamac ore body is an Archean age shear-related orogenic gold system.\nMineralization occurs as a continuous shear-hosted zone, the Wasa Shear, with\nconsistent grade distribution and wide mining widths. Gold is associated with\ndisseminated pyrite within sheared albite-sericite-carbonate alteration zones\nand pyrite rich stockwork. The Wasamac, Francoeur, and Arntfield historic\nmines have past production of over 720,000 ounces of gold, with Francoeur and\nArntfield contributing ounces at grades of 6.2 g/t and 4.0 g/t of gold,\nrespectively. The amalgamated Wasamac and Francoeur properties covers 12\nkilometres of the Wasa Shear, with excellent exploration potential, as well as\na number of shear-hosted targets located south of the Wasa Shear and north of\nthe Cadillac Larder fault zone.\n\nIn early 2021, the Company commenced a planned infill and exploration drilling\ncampaign to generate additional mineral reserves, expand the current mineral\nresource envelopes to depth and in poorly tested areas, and to test extensions\nof the Wasa Shear zone, a subsidiary structure of the Cadillac-Larder Lake\ntectonic zone. Another key objective is to develop secondary targets, such as\nthe Wildcat zone, on the broader Wasamac property. Exploration expenditures\nfor 2021 and 2022 are estimated at $15 million with 120,000 metres of drilling\nplanned. Infill drilling will include at least 68,000 metres and the balance\nwill be exploration drilling, both on the Wasamac and Francoeur projects. The\nprogram is anticipated to ramp up to four drill rigs by late 2021.\n\nExploratory drilling on satellite targets was initiated at Wasamac in the\nsecond quarter of 2021. An initial two drill holes tested for the extension of\nthe Wasa Shear zone towards the Horne Creek fault, confirming the presence of\nthe shear zone and this area. This target will be tested further in ongoing\ndrilling. Drilling was also initiated at the Wildcat zone, an historic shaft\nand area of past exploration located approximately 300 metres south of the\nWasa Shear. Initial exploratory step out drilling at this target expanded the\ndown-dip continuity of the known historic zones that are not included in the\ncurrent Wasamac mineral reserve or mineral resource, underscoring the\npotential to advance zones of higher grade and significantly increase future\nproduction and extend mine life, close to planned mine infrastructure,\nconsistent with the Company\u2019s objective of sustaining a production level of\n200,000 ounces per year and extending the strategic mine life to more than 15\nyears.\n\nHighlights from initial drilling at Wildcat include the following uncut\nestimated true width intercepts: 1.65 g/t of gold over 14.91 metres, including\n3.07 g/t of gold over 2.56 metres, and 3.68 g/t of gold over 2.57 metres\n(WS-21-504); 3.84 g/t of gold over 13.25 metres, including 6.40 g/t of gold\nover 7.10 metres (WS-21-508); 3.16 g/t of gold over 5.35 metres, including\n5.96 g/t of gold over 2.45 metres, and 13.03 g/t of gold over 3.16 metres\n(WS-21-509); and 5.02 g/t of gold over 11.02 metres, including 10.93 g/t of\ngold over 2.20 metres, and 4.47 g/t of gold over 6.57 metres (WS-21-511).\nMineralization is associated with quartz-carbonate-albite-pyrite-hematite\nveinlets, veining and stockwork zones, and disseminated and vein-hosted\nsulphide mineralization with rare visible gold hosted by zones of strongly\naltered, sheared and brecciated gabbro and mafic to intermediate dykes and\nvolcanic units. The zone is currently interpreted to follow a northeast\ntrending shear zone but individual vein orientations vary and modelling\nremains in progress. See Table 1 and Figures 2 and 3 for further details.\n\nWithin the greater Wasamac\u2013Francoeur properties, compilation work is underway\nto develop and rank new targets. Supporting activity includes the merging and\ninterpretation of high-resolution airborne magnetics that now cover the entire\nproperty package. Yamana has received the required permits to begin an\nextensive infill and exploration program on the main Wasamac orebodies. Infill\ndrilling will begin this month and accelerate with additional drills being\nadded over the next two months.  \n\nThe initial drilling results reinforce the Company\u2019s vision for a\n200,000-ounce-plus per year operation with a strategic mine life of at least\n15 years. Building on the initial mineral reserve mine life of 10 years, as\noutlined in the recently completed feasibility study, the internal 15-year\nstrategic mine plan incorporates a portion of the 326,000 ounces of indicated\nmineral resources and 258,000 ounces of inferred mineral resources, which are\nexpected to be converted to mineral reserves through infill drilling and\nadditional engineering. The balance of the 15-year production profile is based\non a conservative estimate of exploration potential including extension of the\nWasa Shear at depth and along strike and inclusion of satellite deposits\noutside of the core mineral reserves footprint, of which the Wildcat zone is\njust the first of many exploration targets that the Company will test in the\ncoming months and years. At minimum, conversion of mineral resources and\nexploration potential is expected to extend mine life and sustain a gold\nproduction profile of approximately 200,000 ounces per year. A possible upside\nis that the added mineralization could be higher grade than the current\naverage mineral reserve grade of 2.56 g/t, which would unlock opportunities to\nincrease feed grade and raise annual production beyond 200,000 ounces per\nyear. The grades from initial drilling results at Wildcat and historic mining\ngrades from the Francoeur properties are positive indicators in this regard.\n\nExtending the Wasamac mine life from 10 to 15 years, and sustaining a gold\nproduction rate of 200,000 ounces per year, would have a significant impact on\nthe value of the project. Using only mineral reserves, the feasibility study\n10-year mine plan delivers robust economics with a post-tax net present value\n(\u201cNPV\u201d) of $254.4 million at a 5% discount rate and internal rate of return\n(\u201cIRR\u201d) of 16.1% at the base case assumptions of $1,550 per ounce of gold and\na 1.28 Canadian-US dollar exchange rate. At a gold price of $1,850 per ounce,\nNPV and IRR increase to $469.6 million and 24%, respectively. The 15-year\nstrategic plan is estimated to more than double the NPV from the feasibility\nstudy scenario, resulting in an NPV of $850 million to $900 million using a\ngold price assumption of $1,850 per ounce.\n\n **Table 1: Wasamac Project, 2021 Drilling Highlights for Intervals Greater\nThan 5.0 Gram*Metres (Gold g/t Uncut Multiplied by Estimated True Width in\nMetres).**\n\n **Hole**\n\n|\n\n **Including**\n\n|\n\n **From  \n(m)**\n\n|\n\n **To**  \n **(m)**\n\n|\n\n **Core  \nLength  \n(m)**\n\n|\n\n **Est.

Lavra Velha is\nlocated about 300 kilometres from Jacobina and could share potential synergies\nwith the mine administration and overhead. The generative exploration program\nhas already identified inferred mineral resources at Lavra Velha of 3.93\nmillion tonnes at 4.29 g/t of gold for 543,000 ounces of goId, which\nrepresents one-third of the 1.5 million ounces of inferred mineral resources\nbeing targeted by the Company under the generative exploration program.\n\nExploration continues to generate and test new and existing advanced\nprospective areas within and around the Lavra Velha deposit with the aim of\ndefining new shallow oxide mineralization and exploring for new mineral\ndiscoveries in the district. The Lavra Velha and Lavra Velha SW deposits are\nhosted by northeast-southwest trending low-angle ductile-brittle structures\nthat play an integral role in localizing mineralization on the property, and\nwhich provide a first-order guide to exploration along trend and to depth.\n\nExploratory drilling targeting the down-dip continuity of these systems has\nintercepted high-grade gold-copper mineralization related to a sulfide rich\nzone below the Lavra Velha SW deposit. Drilling highlights from this area\ninclude the following estimated true width intercepts: 5.49 g/t of gold and\n2.49% of copper over 7.85 metres, and 4.56 g/t of gold over 1.02 metres,\nwithin a wider 13.50-metre interval, grading 1.89 g/t of gold (hole FSW00025,\nstarting at 166.11 metres down hole). The mineralized interval, represented by\niron-oxide and sulfide-rich breccia bodies and associated potassic\nhydrothermal alteration, opens up a significant new high-grade gold-copper\ntarget for exploration below shallow oxide gold mineralization on the\nproperty. Additional drilling is in progress. See Figure 4 and Table 2 for\nadditional details.\n\nAt Anomalia Central, located 2.5 kilometres south of the Lavra Velha deposit,\nexploratory drilling intercepted a wide zone of strong sericitic alteration\ncorresponding with surface gold geochemical anomalies in proximity to a second\nnortheast striking low-angle fault structure. Initial drilling returned the\nfollowing estimated true width intercept: 1.08 g/t of gold over 3.14 metres,\nincluding 4.52 g/t of gold over 0.72 metres (starting at 78.80 metres down\nhole) in drill hole FLV00169. These results highlight the presence of a large,\nstructurally-controlled mineralized system with potential for the discovery of\nsignificant shallow oxide mineralization in this sector. See Figure 4 and\nTable 2 for additional details.\n\nAt the Matinos District, located approximately 48 kilometres south of the\nLavra Velha deposit, recent exploration has focused on the advancement of a\nportfolio of prospective mineral concessions totaling 9,330 hectares in nine\nexploration permits acquired through auction from the Brazilian Mining\nAgency\u2019s public tender process. Geologically, these concessions are located\nwithin a Proterozoic granite terrain, a similar geological context to the\nLavra Velha District. Initial field work, including surface rock and soil\nsampling, has identified new anomalies represented by clusters of rock samples\nhaving greater than 1.00 g/t of gold and corresponding with zones of strong\nhydrothermal alteration, iron oxide, quartz veining and sulfides, which are\nsimilar features to those found at the Lavra Velha and Lavra Velha SW\ndeposits. Several sectors have been identified including Manga Grande, Pinha\nPreta, and Alvinop\u00f3lis which may be tested in future drilling campaigns. See\nFigure 5 for further details.\n\nThe significant exploration advances at Lavra Velha during the reporting\nperiod, including the discovery of high-grade gold-copper mineralization below\nLavra Velha SW, the identification of important shallow oxide gold\nmineralization in new drilling at the Anomalia Central target, and the\naddition of a large, prospective land package with developing drill targets\nunderscore the excellent upside potential of the project.\n\n **Figure 4: Lavra Velha Plan Map Showing Geology, Lavra Velha and Lavra Velha\nSW Deposits, and 2021 Drilling Highlights, as Discussed in Text.  \n**<https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/dbda8c62-d412-4112-876b-c73432e9338f>\n\n **Figure 5: Plan Map of Key Regional Geology Features, Main Targets and\nSurface Rock Gold Geochemistry, Lavra Velha and Matinos Districts.  \n**<https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/a083aeb3-d3c6-465b-8601-88ecfb52e9a1>\n\n **Table 2: Lavra Velha 2021 Drilling Highlights for Intervals Greater Than\n3.0 Gram*Metres (Gold g/t Multiplied by Estimated True Width in Metres).**\n\n **Hole**\n\n|\n\n **Sector**\n\n|\n\n **Including**\n\n|\n\n **From**  \n **(m)**\n\n|\n\n **To**  \n **(m)**\n\n|\n\n **Core  \nLength**  \n **(m)**\n\n|\n\n **Est.

The Twin Lakes deposit continues to be evaluated as\nan open pit operation but is also being re-evaluated as an underground project\nbased on encouraging results from an internal study and a revised deposit\ninterpretation that indicates the presence of steeply plunging higher-grade\nshoots. The Company continues with deeper drilling targeting high-grade\nmineralized shoots.\n\nEncouraging previously reported drill results from 2020 include the following\nestimated true width intercepts: 14.86 metres at 3.32 g/t of gold, including\n7.20 metres at 5.58 g/t of gold (TL-20-703); 7.46 metres at 6.68 g/t of gold\n(TL-20-712); 4.06 metres at 8.64 g/t of gold, including 3.07 metres at 10.73\ng/t of gold (TL-20-715); and 4.64 metres at 5.29 g/t of gold (TL-20-702). For\nadditional details, see the Yamana press release titled \u2018Yamana Gold Advances\nProjects in its Generative Program\u2019 published December 3, 2020, available at\nwww.yamana.com.\n\nWinter drilling in 2020-2021 continued to test the projections to depth of\nmineralized shoots, confirming the presence of characteristic deposit\nmineralization, lithologies and alteration features at depth, with preliminary\nassociated anomalous gold values. Drilling results include the following\nestimated true width intervals: 1.05 g/t of gold over 12.16 metres, and 3.49\ng/t of gold over 7.61 metres, including a higher-grade core over 2.27 metres\ngrading 7.48 g/t of gold, with 0.39 metres grading 29.00 g/t of gold\n(TL-21-727B); and 2.34 g/t of gold over 9.73 metres, including 6.52 g/t gold\nover 2.22 metres (TL 21-732).

Exploration at Borborema led to the recent discovery\nand ongoing delineation of a copper rich mineralized body. Massive to semi\nmassive copper rich sulphides occur in a wider panel of disseminated\nmineralization.\n\nExploration drilling in the high-grade S\u00e3o Francisco target completed in late\n2020 and the first quarter of 2021 has successfully extended the mineralized\nzone over an additional 1,000 metres along strike in an east-west direction.\nMineralization is currently defined semi-continuously along a 2.3-kilometre\ncorridor. Both disseminated and massive sulfide zones remain open for\nexpansion down-dip and along strike, and indicate potential for development of\na significant polymetallic system with associated gold.\n\nRecent drilling results highlight a wide, lower-grade mineralized envelope\nbordering massive sulphide horizons not previously recognized. Drilling\nhighlights include the following core length intercepts: 0.26% of copper over\n40.15 metres, including 1.02% of copper over 5.16 metres (SF-026, starting at\n261.00 metres down hole); and 1.03% of copper, 0.10 g/t of gold and 0.17% of\nzinc over 9.24 metres, including 0.20 g/t of gold, 1.81% of copper and 0.19%\nof zinc over 5.00 metres (SF-020, starting at 115.11 metres down hole).\n\nDrill holes SF-020 and SF-026 are located approximately 1.5 kilometres apart\nalong strike, with the intervening strike length untested. A second low-grade\ndisseminated sulfide horizon intercepted in the S\u00e3o Francisco footwall could\nindicate a new, parallel sulphide lens at depth. See Figure 6 and Table 4 for\nadditional details.\n\nExploration is ongoing to define and develop new targets at S\u00e3o Francisco and\non the wider Borborema property. High priority targets for follow-up include\nseveral gold and base-metal surface geochemistry anomalies associated with\nareas of hydrothermal alteration and sulfide mineralization, suggesting\npotential for the discovery of additional, similar zones of mineralization\nnear S\u00e3o Francisco. Airborne magnetic and radiometric geophysical surveys are\nscheduled for this year and expected to provide a highly effective exploration\ntool in generating and delineating targets to guide ongoing exploratory work.\n\nResults to date have successfully demonstrated that S\u00e3o Francisco represents a\nlarge, shallow gold-enriched polymetallic system, continuous over more than\ntwo kilometres in strike and open for expansion in all directions. Multiple\nsurface geochemical anomalies indicate the possibility for additional gold and\npolymetallic discoveries.\n\n **Figure 6: Borborema Project, S\u00e3o Francisco** **Sector Details, District\nTargets and Geology.  \n**<https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d946c360-d006-48cb-a5e2-3b0aabce77b0>\n\n **Table 4: Borborema 2021 Drilling Highlights for Intervals Greater Than 2.5%\nCopper*Metres (Copper % Multiplied by Core Length in Metres).**\n\n **Hole**\n\n|\n\n **Sector**\n\n|\n\n **Including**\n\n|\n\n **From (m)**\n\n|\n\n **To (m)**\n\n|\n\n **Core Length**  \n **(m)**\n\n|\n\n **Gold**  \n **(g/t)**\n\n|\n\n **Copper**  \n **(%)**\n\n|\n\n **Zinc**  \n **(%)**  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \nSF-020  \n\n|\n\nS\u00e3o Francisco  \n\n| |\n\n115.11\n\n|\n\n124.35\n\n|\n\n9.24\n\n|\n\n0.10\n\n|\n\n1.03\n\n|\n\n0.17  \n  \nIncl.\n\n|\n\n116.00\n\n|\n\n121.00\n\n|\n\n5.00\n\n|\n\n0.20\n\n|\n\n1.81\n\n|\n\n0.19  \n  \nSF-024  \n\n|\n\nS\u00e3o Francisco  \n\n| |\n\n138.08\n\n|\n\n143.92\n\n|\n\n5.84\n\n|\n\n0.04\n\n|\n\n0.61\n\n|\n\n0.08  \n  \nIncl.\n\n|\n\n140.85\n\n|\n\n142.55\n\n|\n\n1.70\n\n|\n\n0.16\n\n|\n\n1.96\n\n|\n\n0.13  \n  \nSF-025\n\n|\n\nS\u00e3o Francisco\n\n| |\n\n236.00\n\n|\n\n265.28\n\n|\n\n29.28\n\n|\n\n0.04\n\n|\n\n0.10\n\n|\n\n0.02  \n  \nSF-026  \n\n|\n\nS\u00e3o Francisco  \n\n| |\n\n261.00\n\n|\n\n301.15\n\n|\n\n40.15\n\n|\n\n0.01\n\n|\n\n0.26\n\n|\n\n0.04  \n  \nIncl.\n\n|\n\n294.54\n\n|\n\n299.70\n\n|\n\n5.16\n\n|\n\n0.05\n\n|\n\n1.02\n\n|\n\n0.09  \n  \nSF-031  \n\n|\n\nS\u00e3o Francisco  \n\n| |\n\n257.53\n\n|\n\n285.00\n\n|\n\n27.47\n\n|\n\n0.01\n\n|\n\n0.22\n\n|\n\n0.03  \n  \nIncl.\n\n|\n\n265.18\n\n|\n\n272.41\n\n|\n\n7.23\n\n|\n\n0.02\n\n|\n\n0.46\n\n|\n\n0.03  \n  \n **Jacobina Norte**\n\nThe Jacobina Norte project, located in Brazil\u2019s Bahia State and contiguous\nwith and to the north of the Company\u2019s Jacobina mine property, comprises a\ntotal of 78,000 hectares of exploration concessions, covering a 150-kilometer\nstrike extent of the favourable Serra do Corrego formation, which host the\npaleoplacer gold deposits of the Jacobina mine.\n\nPreliminary work, including mapping the favourable conglomerate reefs and the\ncollection of over 7,000 rock samples, has outlined a continuous six-kilometre\ntrend with drill targets defined by 140 rock samples that have returned over\n1.00 g/t gold. Follow-up drilling was recently initiated to test multiple\ntargets, such as Barroc\u00e3o, Barroc\u00e3o Velho, Angicos, and Andorinhas. These\ntargets are defined by gold values in surface rock samples above 1.0 g/t and\nranging up to 5.8 g/t of gold related to multiple, continuous conglomerate\nhorizons that are geologically comparable to those hosting paleoplacer gold\nmineralization at the Jacobina mine.\n\nSelect historic drill results from Jacobina Norte reported as core length\ninclude: 5.38 metres at 3.97 g/t of gold, 2.50 metres at 2.58 g/t of gold; and\n4.13 metres at 2.34 g/t of gold. An initial six drill holes completed to date\nhave successfully intersected the down-dip extension of conglomerate reefs in\nall areas tested, returning anomalous gold values in most holes, including the\nfollowing core length intercept: 0.32 metres at 6.91 g/t of gold (BRC-005\nhole, starting at 188.78 metres down hole), testing the Barroc\u00e3o Velho sector.\nSee Figure 7 for additional details. Drilling will continue to test multiple\nwidely spaced targets on the property to rapidly define the highest priority\nareas.\n\nWhile the drilling program advances, ongoing exploration continues to develop\nnew sectors, such as Arapongas, in the south portion of the trend, represented\nby extensive occurrences of conglomerate sequences that extend continuously\nalong an approximately 1.0-kilometre corridor. Arapongas contains individual\nconglomerate lenses reaching up to 20 metres in width and returning gold\nvalues in surface rock samples ranging up to 11.0 g/t of gold. The sector\nrepresents the largest conglomerate sequence identified at Jacobina Norte and\nis an important target for drill testing.\n\nResults to date at Jacobina Norte continue to demonstrate the impressive\nexploration potential of the property, with extensive wide, continuous\nsequences of mineralized Serra do Corrego formation conglomerate exposed at\nsurface, and geological features similar to those found at the multi-million\nounce Jacobina mine deposit.\n\n **Figure 7: Jacobina Norte Project Plan Map Showing Main Target Areas, Rock\nGold Geochemistry and Drilling.  \n**<https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/7ea4ab5a-87c4-47ac-893b-a3b8c96d8fa5>\n\n **Falcon**\n\nThe Falcon property is a 20,000-hectare land package located in Santa Cruz\nProvince in southern Argentina approximately 90 kilometres northwest of\nYamana\u2019s Cerro Moro mine. The project is located in a similar geological\nenvironment to the Cerro Moro vein system, represented by the sequence of well\nstratified, shallow-dipping, sub-aerial felsic pyroclastic and epiclastic\nrocks of the Jurassic age Chin Aike formation.\n\nThe main area of interest is a zone of low-grade near-surface mineralization\nalong a 1.0-kilometre long northeast trend associated with brecciated\nignimbrites and sedimentary breccia. Historic drilling has generated the\nfollowing significant core lengths intercepts: 1.20 g/t of gold and 32.6 g/t\nof silver over 48.00 metres (starting at 3.00 metres downhole; FD-0004); 0.72\ng/t of gold and 10.2 g/t of silver over 71.00 metres (starting at 89.00 metres\ndown hole; FD-0002); and 0.60 g/t of gold and 7.2 g/t of silver over 80.50\nmetres (starting at 43.00 metres down hole; FD-0005).  \nExploration results suggest the project has significant potential to host a\nnear-surface bulk-tonnage gold-silver deposit. Preliminary metallurgical\nstudies and geological modelling are underway.\n\nSystematic exploration of the property conducted in 2021 identified additional\nanomalous sectors such as a new, parallel northeast trending structural zone\nadjacent to the main Falcon trend. Initial surface rock samples in this zone\naveraged 2.6 g/t of gold, with individual samples ranging up 12.9 g/t of gold,\ndefining a new anomalous trend 1.2 kilometres in length. A recently completed\nsoil survey has outlined a gold-in-soil anomaly with greater than 25 parts per\nbillion gold over 1,300 by 500 metres, expanding the near-surface, low-grade\nmineralization target substantially. See Figure 8 for additional details.\n\nThe Falcon project represents a significant opportunity for the Company in\nlight of its proximity to and potential synergies with the Cerro Moro\noperation. The characteristics of the mineralization suggest the potential for\na low-cost, bulk open pit heap leach mining operation with significant upside\npotential and large areas of the property open to exploration.\n\n **Figure 8: Falcon Project Location Map Showing Main Areas of Interest As\nDiscussed in Text.  \n**<https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/23795da1-1458-47b3-a8a2-98c152c8694e>\n\n **TIER THREE PROJECTS**\n\nYamana controls a number of prospective land packages with mineralization on\nsurface and limited or no drilling completed to date. These Tier Three\nprojects represent an important pipeline of opportunities, where the Company\nbelieves they could quickly reach the next exploration stages, providing\norganic growth of new advanced exploration projects over the next decade.\nNotable Tier Three projects include Las Flechas in Argentina and Colider in\nBrazil.\n\n **Las Flechas**\n\nThe Las Flechas Project, located in San Juan province, Argentina, is comprised\nof approximately 30,000 hectares of exploration concessions. The property is\nsituated along the Central Andean Miocene volcanic belt of Chile-Argentina,\none of the most fertile geological environments globally for large epithermal\nand porphyry gold and copper-gold systems, and host to several major mines and\ndeposits including El-Indio, Veladero, and Pascua Lama. The Las Flechas\nproperty is situated 25 kilometres south of the Filo Del Sol project in\nArgentina.\n\nThe current exploration program has focused on the Cerro Dante target area,\nthe site of a significant gold soil anomaly and historic drilling results\nincluding the following core length intercepts in drill hole LFS-DANT 0006:\n1.20 g/t of gold over 34.0 metres (starting 8.0 metres downhole) and 0.33 g/t\nof gold over 92.0 metres, including 0.50 g/t of gold over 24.0 metres\n(starting at 114.0 metres downhole).\n\nThe area hosts a large, north-south elongate breccia complex bordering a\ndacite porphyry stock. Mineralization is interpreted as a breccia-related\nhigh-sulphidation gold system related to an exposed porphyry copper-gold\ncentre. Work in 2021 has focused on mapping, geochemical sampling, and target\ndelineation. This work has led to the discovery of a second breccia complex\nand a new mineralized zone, Silica Este, located 3.5 kilometres east of Cerro\nDante. Soil samples demonstrate gold greater than 25 parts per billion in an\n800 metre by 600 metre area. Follow-up select rock samples have assayed up to\n5.47 g/t of gold and 39.8 g/t of silver from samples of strong silicification\nand extensive breccia. See Figure 9 for additional details. Drill permitting\nis in progress with drilling expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nLas Flechas represents a large prospective land package hosting a robust\nhydrothermal system strategically located in one of the most important\ngeological regions globally for discovery of major high-sulphidation and\nassociated porphyry gold and copper deposits.\n\n **Figure 9: Las Flechas Project Location Map Showing Main Areas of Interest\nDiscussed in Text.  \n**<https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/7d11249b-5290-4944-a30e-dc3a20afd5a2>\n\n **Colider**\n\nColider is an early stage project located in Brazil\u2019s Mato Grosso State in the\nnewly developing Juruena polymetallic District, which has recently been\nexplored for porphyry copper and precious metals deposits by several major and\njunior mining companies. The property consists of approximately 20,000\nhectares and encompasses a sector of the prospective Proterozoic volcanic\nColider sequence, where current exploration has identified several areas of\ninterest defined by large areas of anomalous gold and copper contents in\nsurface geochemical samples. Several drill ready targets have been defined,\nrepresenting a significant opportunity in this new unexplored geological\nenvironment.\n\nInitial exploratory drilling is ongoing at Colider, testing high-grade gold\nand polymetallic soil anomalies hosted in volcanic rocks at the Aruan\u00e3, Inaj\u00e1,\nand Cambar\u00e1 targets. Results are pending. See Figure 10 for additional\ndetails.\n\n **Figure 10: Colider Project Map Showing Main Areas of Interest Discussed in\nText.  \n**<https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/5fd9da14-ac45-4e36-af0d-86e09fad4be2>\n\n **Qualified Persons**  \nScientific and technical information contained in this press release has been\nreviewed and approved by Henry Marsden (P.

On the show, about a middle-class Black household in\nChicago, Winslow (played by Reginald VelJohnson) loved being a police officer\nalmost as much as he hated seeing the family\u2019s pesky neighbor, Steve Urkel\n(Jaleel White), popping up in his home. Carl was a quintessential TV-sitcom\ncop, doughnut clich\u00e9s and all. In one scene, he announces that he\u2019s just had\nthe worst day of his life: \u201cI was in a high-speed car chase and ran out of\ngas.\u201d The humor did not always break new ground.\n\nThe cast of _Family Matters_ was predominantly Black, but the series was\nwritten and conceptualized mainly by white people. A 1994 episode, \u201cGood Cop,\nBad Cop,\u201d illustrates the degree to which a Black writer could be sidelined,\neven on a show about a Black family. In the episode, Carl\u2019s teenage son, Eddie\n(Darius McCrary), storms into the house, visibly upset about a run-in with the\npolice. Yet Carl insists that Eddie\u2019s account of being harassed and forced to\nthe ground doesn\u2019t add up: \u201cThat\u2019s unusual procedure\u2014unless you provoked it.\u201d\nCarl\u2019s response is jarring. He may be Officer Winslow when he\u2019s on duty, but\nhe\u2019s still a Black father\u2014one who ought to know how police in America often\ntreat young Black men. Eddie walks away angry.\n\nFelicia D. Henderson, a Black producer and screenwriter who worked on _Family\nMatters_ from 1994 to 1996 before moving on to _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_ ,\n_Soul Food_ , and _Empire_ , recalls the tension in the writers\u2019 room when the\nepisode was being workshopped. Television shows are typically written by a\nstaff that collaborates on scripts; trading ideas and criticism around a table\nis an integral and sometimes raucous part of the process. Yet there\u2019s a\nhierarchy in the room: The senior writers hold sway and the showrunner is\nultimately in charge. _Family Matters_ was no different. Then a junior writer,\nand one of only a few Black staffers on a team of more than a dozen, Henderson\nwas at first hesitant to weigh in when a white writer tossed out the\npossibility of Carl responding the way he did. But the line felt wrong to her,\nand she spoke up. \u201cI just said, \u2018Well, no Black father would tell his Black\nson that,\u2019 \u201d Henderson told me recently. \u201cAnd the room got silent. I mean, you\ncan hear a pin drop.\u201d The white showrunner defended the line, and it went in.\n\u201cIt was clear in the room and in the moment that I had offended them,\u201d\nHenderson recalled. \u201cLike, \u2018What, are you saying\u2014we\u2019re racist?\u2019 No, but I _am_\nsaying that\u2019s not realistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood Cop, Bad Cop\u201d ends with Carl confronting the officer and reconciling\nwith Eddie. Viewers get the kind of safe conclusion that wraps up a \u201cvery\nspecial episode\u201d: Eddie was right to be upset, because _some_ police officers\nreally are racists. Last year, a month after George Floyd was killed by a\nMinneapolis police officer, the _Family Matters_ cast reunited on Zoom to look\nback at the story line from 25 years ago. \u201cWhen they wrote the episode, we\ndidn\u2019t realize it would be so revealing and telling today,\u201d VelJohnson said.\n\nRevealing and telling, yes, but maybe not in the way he thought. For\nHenderson, working on _Family Matters_ offered an introduction to a defining\nfeature of her long career in Hollywood. _Negotiated authenticity_ is the\nphrase she uses to describe what many Black screenwriters are tasked with\nproducing\u2014Blackness, sure, but only of a kind that is acceptable to white\nshowrunners, studio executives, and viewers.\n\n![Still from 'Family Matters' with characters Eddie Winslow, Steve Urkel with\narms extended, and Carl Winslow in uniform.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg\nxmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 655 437' /%3E) _From left to\nright_ : Eddie Winslow (Darius McCrary), Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), and Carl\nWinslow (Reginald VelJohnson) in _Family Matters_. The sitcom\u2019s cast was\npredominantly Black, but the series was written and conceptualized mainly by\nwhite people. (ABC / Everett Collection)\n\nThe nature of the \u201cnegotiation\u201d that Black writers must conduct has shifted\nover the years. Half a century ago, just getting Black characters on TV was a\nhurdle, and Black screenwriters were few. Today, as more networks and\nstreaming platforms advertise the Black shows they\u2019ve lined up\u2014you\u2019d be\nforgiven for thinking that every month is Black History Month\u2014it is tempting\nto believe that Black performers and writers [now have a wealth of\nopportunities](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/01/claiming-\nthe-future-of-black-tv/514562/), including wide creative latitude for those\nwho make it to the top. This era of \u201cpeak TV,\u201d in which the entertainment\nlandscape is saturated with more high-quality series than ever before, _has_\nbeen a boon in some respects. According to data collected in UCLA\u2019s 2020\n\u201c[Hollywood Diversity Report](https://socialsciences.ucla.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/10/UCLA-Hollywood-Diversity-\nReport-2020-Television-10-22-2020.pdf),\u201d an annual study of the entertainment\nindustry\u2019s progress, or lack of it, nearly 10 percent of lead roles on TV were\nfilled by Black actors, likely the closest the industry has ever come to\nproportional representation (which would be about 13 percent). Shonda Rhimes,\nas titanic as any creative figure in the industry, is the force behind several\nof the most successful series in recent memory, ratings juggernauts such as\n_Grey\u2019s Anatomy_ , _Scandal_ , and _How to Get Away With Murder_. Kenya\nBarris, the creator of _Black-ish_ , has produced comedic series that take on\ndeadly serious issues of race while appealing to a diverse group of viewers.\n\nYet for all the strides that figures like Rhimes and Barris have made, the\npower in the television industry still rests mostly in the hands of white\nexecutives. The UCLA diversity report revealed that less than 11 percent of\nbroadcast scripted-show creators, less than 15 percent of cable scripted-show\ncreators, and less than 11 percent of digital scripted-show creators come from\n_any_ underrepresented racial group. (These groups, taken together, make up\nroughly 40 percent of the U.S. population.) At Netflix, for which Rhimes\nproduces shows and Barris did until recently, only 12 percent of scripted-\nseries creators are people of color\u2014this [from a study commissioned by Netflix\nitself](https://assets.ctfassets.net/4cd45et68cgf/3lLceJCJj7NJsKUeIJHrKG/920c17c6207bd4c3aa7f5a209a23f034/Inclusion_in_Netflix_Original_Series_and_Films_2.26.21.pdf).\nAccording to [a 2017 survey of the industry as a\nwhole](https://hollywood.colorofchange.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/03/COC_Hollywood_Race_Report.pdf), 91 percent of shows\nare led by white showrunners. Too often, as Henderson put it to me, \u201cit\u2019s\nstill white people determining what the Black experience is and then hiring\nBlack writers to \u2018authenticate\u2019 it.\u201d\n\nSince its invention, television has shaped this country\u2019s self-image. To the\nextent that we share notions of \u201cnormal,\u201d \u201cacceptable,\u201d \u201cfunny,\u201d \u201cwrong,\u201d and\neven \u201cAmerican,\u201d television has helped define them. For decades, Black writers\nwere shut out of the rooms in which those notions were scripted, and even\ntoday, they must navigate a set of implicit rules established by white\nexecutives\u2014all while fighting for the power to write rules of their own.\n\n### II. _Othello_ in Watts\n\nThe history of significant Black representation on television is a short one.\nThe medium\u2019s racial progress has been like that of most other American\nindustries: slow, cyclical, uneven. In the early years, Black Americans turned\non their TV sets and found themselves written out of the American story\u2014or,\nworse, appearing only as caricatures. Not long ago, I came across a photograph\nof the 1963 March on Washington that made clear how starved Black audiences\nwere to see their lives depicted on TV. In the photo, [a protest\nsign](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/civil-rights-march-on-\nwashington-dc-august-28-1963-more-news-photo/185576233), referring to the\npopular program _Lassie_ , reads: Look Mom! Dogs have TV shows. Negroes\ndon\u2019t!!\n\nThat wasn\u2019t completely true. In the 1950s and \u201960s, African Americans like Nat\nKing Cole and Sammy Davis Jr. headlined variety shows. But the discontent\nexpressed in messages like that March on Washington sign spoke to something\nbigger than token representation: a belief, at least among the middle class,\nthat most existing television shows didn\u2019t account for the political or\ncultural interests of Black people. At the time, comedies and dramas with\nBlack writers and actors were virtually nonexistent. The few early roles\navailable for actors of color drew on offensive stereotypes and outright\nminstrelsy\u2014 _Amos \u2019n\u2019 Andy_ , which aired from 1951 to 1953, was the most\nnotorious example. White television executives were reluctant to sign off on\nstory lines that featured Black people in complex roles or depicted them as a\ncentral part of American society. TV advertising was aimed at the white middle\nclass.\n\nIn 1968, NBC debuted _Julia_ , starring Diahann Carroll as a single mother\nraising a son while working as a nurse. Julia was the first middle-class Black\nwoman to be featured as the lead character in a prime-time series, and given\nthe show\u2019s conceit\u2014she had been widowed when her husband was killed in\nVietnam\u2014it might have offered a pointed commentary on the politics of the\nmoment. In practice, however, the series stuck to easy laughs about family\nlife, rarely touching on race except to make jokes that Carroll in a memoir\ncharacterized as \u201cwarm and genteel and \u2018nice.\u2019 \u201d The show\u2019s creator, Hal\nKanter, was white, and as he told _Ebony_ in 1968, he wanted \u201centertainment,\u201d\nnot \u201cagony.\u201d In a cover interview for _TV Guide_ , published eight months\nafter the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Carroll acknowledged the\nshow\u2019s shortcomings. \u201cAt the moment,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019re presenting the white\nNegro. And he has very little Negro-ness.\u201d She would later tell Kanter that\nthe stress of playing a role so far removed from the Black life she knew had\nmade her physically ill.\n\nNot until 1972 did a network attempt something more daring. That year, Norman\nLear, the creator of [the hit series _All in the\nFamily_](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/03/how-all-family-\nchanged-american-tv-forever/618353/), and the producer Bud Yorkin launched\n_Sanford and Son_ , an adaptation of the BBC\u2019s _Steptoe and Son_. The show\nstarred the Black actors John Elroy Sanford (better known as Redd Foxx) and\nDemond Wilson as father-son junk dealers Fred and Lamont. The Sanfords were\nhardly the archetypal family next door. They lived in Watts, a Los Angeles\nneighborhood that existed to most non-Black viewers as the focal point of the\n1965 police-brutality protests that escalated into a week of violence. The\nseries regularly addressed the racism its characters faced as Black men\nnavigating a post-civil-rights-era America, and the passage of time has not\nblunted its edge. In one episode, Lamont, who dreams of the stage, is\npreparing to act in _Othello_. He has the title role\u2014the dark-skinned \u201cMoor.\u201d\nA white woman plays Desdemona. When Fred stumbles on a rehearsal of the play\u2019s\nmurderous climax, he pulls his Black son and the white woman apart. He isn\u2019t\nreassured when he\u2019s told that it\u2019s just a play. \u201cWell you better have the\nNational Guard standing by,\u201d he warns.\n\nFor many Black viewers, seeing that kind of exchange between father and son in\nprime time was thrilling, a fact that Lear picked up on when he looked out at\nhis studio audience. By then, he had been working in television for two\ndecades; he knew firsthand how white most of those audiences were. The live\naudience for _Sanford and Son_ was different. \u201cThere\u2019s no experience like\nstanding behind an audience composed like that\u2014half Black, or half Black and\nbrown, but all kinds of people\u2014and watching them laugh hard, like, belly\nlaugh,\u201d Lear, who is 99, told me recently. \u201cI\u2019m very confident that added time\nto my life.\u201d\n\n _Sanford and Son_ soared to the top of national ratings, challenging the\nlong-held industry assumption that white audiences wouldn\u2019t tune in to a\nseries about Black characters. To some degree, this was a function of Lear\u2019s\nearlier successes: Fred Sanford drew easy comparisons to Archie Bunker, the\nblue-collar patriarch of _All in the Family_. Both characters were\ncantankerous middle-aged men; both tossed around racial slurs and misogynistic\ncommentary. Some of the humor has not aged well. Still, the later series,\nwhich ran for six seasons, exposed the prime-time audience to Black performers\nand Black modes of comedy. Foxx didn\u2019t regularly write for the show, but\n_Sanford_ \u2019s incisive commentary on the indignities and joys of Black life in\nAmerica worked so well thanks to his training as a stand-up comedian, with a\nstyle and sensibility the writers could channel. \u201cHe was a lounge act in Las\nVegas, and we happened on him and couldn\u2019t get over how much he belonged on\ntelevision,\u201d Lear recalled. _Sanford_ brought the creative genius of Black\ncomics to viewers who would never set foot in the kinds of clubs where Foxx\nand his peers performed. The show later pulled in the writing skills of other\nBlack comics, including Paul Mooney and Richard Pryor, and employed Ilunga\nAdell, one of the first Black writers to work full-time on a network series.\n\n![3 video stills: Lamont and Fred Sanford clasping hands and laughing; Julia\nand her son talking; George and Louise Jefferson talking in their living\nroom](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0\n0 655 1132' /%3E)Julia (Diahann Carroll, _middle_ ) was the first middle-class\nBlack woman to be featured as the lead character in a prime-time series. The\nNorman Lear\u2013produced shows _Sanford and Son_ ( _top_ ) and _The Jeffersons_ (\n_bottom_ ) proved that series with predominantly Black casts could be hits.\n(Everett Collection; RGR Collection / Alamy; Columbia TV / Everett Collection)\n\n _Sanford and Son_ made possible the spate of Black sitcoms that followed,\nincluding others from Lear. _The Jeffersons_ had a direct _All in the Family_\nconnection: George (Sherman Hemsley) and Louise (Isabel Sanford) owned a dry-\ncleaning chain in Queens and had lived next door to the Bunkers. [Their own\nseries saw them\nshine](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/08/what-the-\njeffersons-taught-me-about-being-an-american/260812/), as business success\nallowed the couple to move from Queens to that \u201cdeeeeluxe apartment in the\nsky,\u201d on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. Black writers on the series included\nSara Finney-Johnson, who would go on to co-create the sitcom _Moesha_ , and\nBooker Bradshaw, an actor who later wrote for _Good Times_ and _The Richard\nPryor Show_.\n\n _Sanford and Son_ and _The Jeffersons_ proved that series with predominantly\nBlack casts could be hits. Yet white executives continued to view Black shows\nas too much of a gamble. They didn\u2019t want to risk losing a large, affluent\nwhite audience by appealing to what they dismissed as a smaller, poorer Black\none. Television therefore remained almost entirely white; to be a Black writer\nor actor in the TV industry of the 1970s was to face exclusion at nearly every\nturn. When it came to staffing creative teams, the presumption was that white\nwriters could write anything at all, but Black writers could contribute only\nto Black shows.\n\n### III. Damned If You Do, Damned If You Don\u2019t\n\nThe 1980s produced little programming that focused on Black performers, and\nfew of the shows lasted more than a single season. At the time, _JET_ magazine\npublished a weekly list of every Black appearance on television, a list that\ngenerally showed African Americans playing \u201ccomic support\u201d or \u201cminority\nsidekick\u201d roles. The August 13, 1984, issue included the following: Kim Fields\nas the precocious Dorothy \u201cTootie\u201d Ramsey on _The Facts of Life_ , Roger E.\nMosley as the helicopter pilot T.C. on _Magnum P.I._ , Tim Reid as Lieutenant\n\u201cDowntown\u201d Brown on _Simon & Simon_, and Paula Kelly as the public defender\nLiz Williams on _Night Court_.\n\nThe lack of opportunities can partly be explained by the waning dominance of\nsitcoms, where Black writers and actors had made some inroads. Some of the\nexplanation is cultural. Ronald Reagan was president. _Family Ties_ , with its\nformer-hippie parents raising a conservative son, was a reverse _All in the\nFamily_ , but there was no _Sanford_ -style counterpart. On both _Diff\u2019rent\nStrokes_ , which ran from 1978 to 1986 on NBC, and _Webster_ , which ran from\n1983 to 1989 on ABC, Black youngsters (played by Gary Coleman and Emmanuel\nLewis, respectively) were essentially rescued from poverty by rich white\nfamilies, a parable of trickle-down harmony. The Blackness of the two boys\nexisted in opposition to the white affluence surrounding them.\n\n _The Cosby Show_ was the great exception. Today, Bill Cosby\u2019s name is\nsynonymous with his crimes: The 84-year-old actor was convicted of felony\nsexual assault in 2018 and sentenced to a prison term of up to 10 years.\n(Earlier this year, he was released from prison after Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme\nCourt overturned the conviction.) But _The Cosby Show_ remains a touchstone.\nIt was one of the few television shows in the 1980s with a predominantly Black\ncast. It was also hugely successful\u2014among the highest-rated shows in the\nhistory of the medium.\n\nCosby told one producer: \u201cWe\u2019re leaving all of the racial issues up to\n_Newhart_.\u201d\n\nBy the time he developed his eponymous show, Cosby was a beloved comedian, and\nhad co-starred with Robert Culp in the 1960s drama _I Spy_ , a show whose\ninternational settings provided a convenient topical distance from civil-\nrights protests and urban strife in the U.S. Given this background, Cosby had\nfar more control than other Black creators and performers in the industry. He\nenvisioned his new series as a portrait of a family that any American could\nrelate to. \u201cI want to show a family like the kind I know: children who are\nalmost a pain in the neck, and parents who aren\u2019t far behind,\u201d he told _TV\nGuide_ in 1984. The series presented a rare vision of upper-middle-class Black\nlife on TV. Cliff Huxtable (Cosby), a doctor, and his lawyer wife, Clair\n(Phylicia Rashad), lived in a Brooklyn brownstone and guided their children\ntoward aspirational excellence\u2014television\u2019s very own Du Boisian \u201cTalented\nTenth.\u201d\n\nCosby\u2019s determination to depict an affluent Black family was radical in its\nway. For one, it challenged viewers who could only conceive of a Black\nhousehold that looked like Fred and Lamont Sanford\u2019s junk-strewn living\nroom\u2014or, at best, the bootstrapping success of the Jeffersons. But it also\npushed back on a pernicious idea that had taken hold among television\nexecutives and critics alike: that Black programs must not only be compelling\ncreative productions\u2014good TV shows\u2014but also somehow manage to capture Black\nlife in a way that white people deem \u201crealistic.\u201d Susan Fales-Hill, one of\njust a handful of Black writers on Cosby\u2019s creative staff, recalls a white\nViacom executive dismissing the Huxtables as not representative of Black life:\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a good show, but this family is not Black; they\u2019re white.\u201d When\nFales-Hill asked him what made them white, the executive said, \u201cWell, look at\nthat house they live in.\u201d Fales-Hill replied, \u201cMy mother grew up in Brooklyn\nin a house that looked a lot like that, taking violin lessons while her sister\ntook piano lessons.\u201d\n\nThe writer John Markus, who is white and was an executive producer on _Cosby_\n, remembers the show\u2019s star explicitly pushing back against the expectation\nthat his show be \u201cBlack\u201d in a way that conformed to the perceptions of people\nwho aren\u2019t. Cosby also resisted the demand that a series about Black Americans\nbe about race. The characters occasionally made references to global events,\nsuch as anti-apartheid demonstrations in South Africa, but they were rarely\nseen having experiences with homegrown racism, despite living in a deeply\nsegregated city. An episode that aired close to Martin Luther King\u2019s birthday\ndidn\u2019t dwell on the politics of the holiday, instead marking the occasion more\nsubtly: A squabble over borrowed clothing is exposed for its pettiness when\nthe family becomes transfixed by King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech playing on the\nHuxtables\u2019 TV set. At the start of the second season, Markus told me,\njournalists \u201cwanted an answer to the question \u2018When will the show get into\nissues like multiracial dating\u2014like, when are these kids going to date a\nwhite; when are you going to do that story?\u2019 And at some point I said, \u2018I\u2019ve\ngot to go talk to Bill about this,\u2019 and I went to his dressing room. He didn\u2019t\neven hesitate. He looked me in the eye and he said, \u2018You go back to each one\nof them and tell them we\u2019re leaving all of the racial issues up to _Newhart_\n,\u2019 which was the whitest show on the planet.\u201d\n\nWhite executives weren\u2019t alone in thinking that _Cosby_ was an unrealistic\nrepresentation of Black life. The series elicited barbed reactions from some\nBlack critics as well. Ostensibly a \u201cpositive\u201d image of a Black family, the\nshow was criticized for inviting white viewers to believe that racial progress\nhad already been achieved. \u201cAs long as all blacks were represented in\ndemeaning or peripheral roles, it was possible to believe that American racism\nwas, as it were, indiscriminate,\u201d the Harvard historian and literary critic\nHenry Louis Gates Jr. [wrote in a 1989 column in _The New York\nTimes_](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/12/arts/tv-s-black-world-turns-but-\nstays-unreal.html). \u201cThe social vision of \u2018Cosby,\u2019 however, reflecting the\nminuscule integration of blacks into the upper middle class (having \u2018white\nmoney,\u2019 my mother used to say, rather than \u2018colored\u2019 money), reassuringly\nthrows the blame for black poverty back onto the impoverished.\u201d\n\nGates\u2019s critique and the white executive\u2019s incredulous reaction to the\nHuxtables\u2019 lifestyle reflected the damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don\u2019t\ndilemma that _Cosby_ writers faced: Be Black, but not too Black. Or: Be Black,\nbut not like that. White writers were never whipsawed this way. The characters\non _Three\u2019s Company_ or _Cheers_ were not expected to convey some universal\nwhite experience. As even Gates allowed, the problem was bigger than Bill\nCosby: \u201cIt\u2019s not the representation itself (Cliff Huxtable, a child of\ncollege-educated parents, is altogether believable), but the role it begins to\nplay in our culture, the status it takes on as being, well, truly\nrepresentative.\u201d A television landscape with a single prominent Black series\ngave viewers a single perspective on Black life.\n\nAt first, the _Cosby_ spin-off _A Different World_ seemed unlikely to escape\nthis bind. The show followed Denise Huxtable (Lisa Bonet) to Hillman College,\nthe fictional historically Black institution that Cliff and Clair Huxtable had\nattended. When that series was first conceived, it focused just as much on a\nwhite student at Hillman (and the bias she experienced) as it did on Denise.\nOnly later did the premise change, with Denise becoming the central character\nand her white roommate, an aspiring journalist played by Marisa Tomei, taking\na supporting role. Throughout its first season, _A Different World_ depicted a\ncollege atmosphere that failed to capture the spirit and nuances of HBCU life.\nJasmine Guy, who played the snobbish Whitley Gilbert, remembers an early\nscript in which students called professors by their first names. \u201cMy father\ntaught at Morehouse,\u201d Guy told me. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way.\u201d\n\nThe tone changed when Debbie Allen, an alumna of Howard University, was\nbrought on as executive producer and director. \u201cWhen Debbie came on board,\u201d\nSusan Fales-Hill told me, \u201cshe was the one who really shook it up.\u201d Allen was\na formidable presence. While Cosby\u2019s show largely ignored issues of race,\nAllen told Cosby that people on her show needed to talk about Blackness and\nabout the issues of the day. \u201cI almost fell off my chair,\u201d Fales-Hill\nrecalled, \u201cwhen he said, \u2018Yeah, you\u2019re right.\u2019 \u201d\n\n![Still of Whitley Gilbert in profile talking with Dwayne Wayne, with\nsunglasses flipped up](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg\nxmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 655 437' /%3E)Whitley Gilbert\n(Jasmine Guy) and Dwayne Wayne (Kadeem Hardison) in the _Cosby Show_ spin-off\n_A Different World_. Though it never occupied the place in popular culture\nthat Cosby did, it was far more radical, exploring racism, AIDS, and\nhomelessness. (Carsey-Werner Co. / Everett Collection)\n\nUnder Allen, _A Different World_ went all the places its progenitor wouldn\u2019t.\nThe series never occupied the place in popular culture that _The Cosby Show_\ndid. But it was far more radical, subtly altering the trajectory of\ntelevision\u2014both through its handling of race and through the opportunities it\ngave to Black writers who have shaped the industry in the decades since.\n\n _A Different World_ explored racism, AIDS, homelessness, and rape, grounding\nits treatment of these subjects in the experiences of characters who varied in\npersonality, appearance, and social status. Denise, of course, came from a\ncomfortably upper-middle-class family. Her other roommate, Jaleesa Vinson\n(Dawnn Lewis), had enrolled at Hillman at the age of 25, after a failed\nmarriage; she was typically shown working at a job. Guy\u2019s Whitley Gilbert was\nthe daughter of well-to-do Hillman alumni; she had arrived at school with the\nexpress intention of finding a husband. Other characters included the playboy\nRon Johnson (Darryl M. Bell), the freewheeling activist Freddie Brooks (Cree\nSummer), the athletic graduate student Walter Oakes (Sinbad), and Whitley\u2019s\neventual romantic interest, the lovable nerd Dwayne Wayne (Kadeem Hardison).\n\u201cWhat I loved about doing _A Different World_ was the diversity of Black\npeople that we had on the show,\u201d Guy told me. \u201cSo none of us felt the burden\nof being all things to all people.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that the series avoided the scrutiny of white executives.\nFales-Hill remembered an encounter with the network over a scene in which\nWhitley and Dwayne were arguing about the Amistad, the slave ship whose Black\ncaptives took control but were eventually apprehended and put on trial. She\nrecalled, \u201cThe network came to us and said, \u2018You know, can\u2019t Whitley and\nDwayne be arguing about their date on Saturday night?\u2019 \u201d\n\nOne writer recalled white colleagues looking her way and asking, \u201cDoes that\nsound right to you?,\u201d as though there were a single way to be, or to sound,\nBlack.\n\nIn 1992, Allen and the show\u2019s writers wanted to take on the riots in Los\nAngeles that followed the acquittal of the police officers involved in the\nbeating of Rodney King. For the white executives to whom Allen, Fales-Hill,\nand the other writers reported, the riots were dangerous narrative territory.\nThe Los Angeles that the executives knew best looked very different from\nKing\u2019s Los Angeles; they saw the riots as an ugly chapter in the city\u2019s\nhistory, something to get past, not memorialize. Eventually, Allen and Fales-\nHill persuaded the network to let them write a two-part episode that directly\naddressed the riots. Fales-Hill remembered having an ominous feeling after the\nmeeting\u2014as if it had been a pyrrhic victory. \u201cThey backed off, and she and I\nleft that meeting going, \u2018Okay, Thelma and Louise\u2014we\u2019ve driven off the cliff\nhere.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe two-part episode, \u201cHoneymoon in L.A.,\u201d opened the show\u2019s sixth season.\nWhitley and Dwayne are on their honeymoon in Los Angeles, and the couple is\nseparated just as the city erupts. Whitley, ever the sheltered southern belle,\ntakes refuge in the luxury-goods section of a department store; at one point,\nshe pretends to be a mannequin. Dwayne, meanwhile, unwittingly helps some\nlooters. Thirty years later, some of the dialogue feels trite or didactic;\nSister Souljah makes a guest appearance to inform Whitley that \u201cthey can beat\nus, kill us, do whatever they wanna do\u2014and get off, just like they always\nhave.\u201d But for Allen, the writers, and the cast, the episode was an important\nreflection of the reality that Black people, especially young Black people,\naround the country were experiencing. Getting such raw material onto prime-\ntime television meant affirming that pain\u2014and showing white viewers how the\nverdict had reverberated across Black households. At the end of the sixth\nseason, the series was canceled.\n\n### IV. \u201cUnder-Paid Negroes\u201d\n\nThe writers who came through _A Different World_ went on to create some of the\nmost prominent Black sitcoms of the \u201990s, a period that proved to be a golden\nera for the form. Among these alumni were Yvette Lee Bowser, the [force behind\n](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/08/how-the-90s-kinda-\nworld-of-living-single-lives-on-today/567880/)_[Living\nSingle](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/08/how-\nthe-90s-kinda-world-of-living-single-lives-on-today/567880/) _(the first\nprime-time TV show created by a Black American woman), and Cheryl Gard, a\nproducer of _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_. Those series ran on Fox and NBC,\nrespectively, and won the wide audiences that more traditional broadcast\nnetworks could still command. Opportunities for other Black creators came from\nthe newer networks UPN and The WB. An early example of the market\nfragmentation that was to come, these new outlets were less concerned with\nbringing as many viewers as possible to national advertisers. Rather, they\nwere content\u2014in their first few years, at least\u2014to reach specific demographic\ngroups and build intense loyalty.\n\n[Read: How the \u201990s kinda world of _Living Single_ lives on\ntoday](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/08/how-\nthe-90s-kinda-world-of-living-single-lives-on-today/567880/)\n\nBy the late \u201990s, UPN and The WB had evening slates full of Black shows and\nemployed a disproportionate share of the writers of color in the television\nindustry. In 1996, UPN debuted _Moesha_ , starring the R&B singer Brandy\nNorwood. With her dark skin and braids, the title character of _Moesha_\nwas\u2014and still is\u2014a rarity in the coming-of-age subgenre. (While _Moesha_ was\non the air, and for several years afterward, Brandy\u2019s photo seemed to be\ntacked up on the wall of every Black beauty salon in America.) The WB was home\nto family shows such as _The Parent \u2019Hood_ and _Smart Guy_ , which mostly\nserved up earnest lessons and tender moments, though they occasionally took on\nweightier issues such as substance abuse and racism in sports. In 1995, the\nnetwork also picked up _Sister, Sister_ from ABC, a teen comedy co-created by\nthe writer and director Kim Bass.\n\nFor Black writers, especially those who\u2019d previously worked only on series\nwith white showrunners, these new opportunities were a revelation\u2014a chance to\nlearn the craft in a space where at least some of the others in the room\nunderstood the lives of the characters they were tasked with depicting. During\nthe season that they worked together on _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_ ,\nFelicia Henderson and Larry Wilmore were the only Black writers on the show,\nwhich had been created by a white couple, Susan and Andy Borowitz. When we\nspoke, Henderson recalled that much of her job amounted to answering a single\nquestion: \u201cIs that what Black people do?\u201d She remembers white colleagues on\nanother show looking her way and asking, \u201cDoes that sound right to you?,\u201d as\nthough there were a single specific way to be, or to sound, Black. Henderson\nwould reply, \u201cI was at a meeting of the All Black Writers Who Know What All\nOther Black People Think just last night \u2026\u201d\n\nHenderson later went to work on _Moesha_ \u2014a very different atmosphere. Working\nunder the creators, Sara Finney-Johnson, Vida Spears, and Ralph Farquhar,\nHenderson at last felt the creative freedom that comes from not having to\nexplain yourself: \u201cThey made the decision that the room would reflect the\npeople who knew the experience of the star.\u201d\n\nWorking in such an environment required a trade-off, however. As the share of\nthe audience claimed by the traditional Big Three networks continued to erode,\nTV was becoming less a single country than a collection of neighborhoods, and\nthe neighborhoods where Black writers were welcome were shabbier than the\nwhite ones. The pay scale on many Black shows left something to be desired. A\n[2007 report](https://www.wga.org/uploadedFiles/who_we_are/HWR07.pdf) released\nby the Writers Guild of America, West, found that the gap in median annual\nsalary between white and Black writers was nearly $15,000 in 2005. The grim\njoke among Black writers and performers was that UPN stood for \u201cUnder-Paid\nNegroes.\u201d\n\n![Stills from 'Sister, Sister' and 'Moesha'](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg\nxmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 655 437' /%3E)By the late\n\u201990s, UPN and The WB had evening slates full of Black shows like  \n_Sister, Sister_ ( _left_ ) and _Moesha_ ( _right_ ). The short-lived networks\nemployed a  \ndisproportionate share of the writers of color in the industry. (R. Cartwright\n/ Paramount Television / Everett Collection; PictureLux / The Hollywood\nArchive / Alamy)\n\nBlack writers who tried to work on shows that weren\u2019t pitched to Black\naudiences ran into a familiar double standard: White writers could\u2014and\ndid\u2014work on Black shows. But Black writers on white projects remained rare.\nKim Bass recalled being asked by a white executive to rewrite the screenplay\nof a buddy comedy\u2014with the caveat that he touch only the Black character\u2019s\ndialogue. Another executive once worried that Bass couldn\u2019t \u201cwrite white.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, after years of struggling to make money and attract audiences, UPN\nand The WB were dissolved in a merger. The move coincided with the early days\nof peak TV, when cable networks, which by the turn of the century were\nreaching some 65 million homes, began producing an array of sophisticated\nseries that have been compared to great cinema and even high literature. But\nfew of these shows afforded more opportunities to Black writers or performers\nthan many of the prestige broadcast series had. _The Sopranos_ on HBO,\n_Dexter_ on Showtime, _Mad Men_ on AMC\u2014these were shows created and performed\nprimarily by white talent. Even HBO\u2019s _The Wire_ , which explored the drug\ntrade in Baltimore and provided ample roles for Black actors, was scripted\nprimarily by white writers. (The series creator, David Simon, has said that\nthe late writer David Mills referred to himself as the \u201c[lone\nNegro](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/megcramer/how-david-simon-builds-\na-writing-team)\u201d in the writers\u2019 room.) Most Black writers didn\u2019t have the\nluxury of wringing their hands over \u201crepresentation\u201d or \u201cauthenticity,\u201d\nhowever. They were worried about their livelihood.\n\n### V. The Shonda Effect\n\nOn a recent morning, I sat down with Kim Bass at the Four Seasons in Beverly\nHills, where he sometimes meets with independent producers who have the power\nto finance his projects. We talked over breakfast about the ways in which\nHollywood has shifted when it comes to Black America, a set of changes that\nBass, 65, could not have imagined when he first broke into the business.\n\nDuring the heyday of Black sitcoms, Bass created two multiseason series built\naround Black characters: _Sister, Sister_ and _Kenan & Kel_, which made the\nyoung comedians Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell into beloved figures.\n(Thompson, long a fixture on _Saturday Night Live_ , now also has his own\nseries, _Kenan_ , on NBC.) _Sister, Sister_ , which ran from 1994 to 1999,\nrevolved around twins who were adopted by different parents as infants and\nthen encountered each other unexpectedly as teens. Bass recalled describing\nthe character Ray (Tim Reid), the adoptive father of one of the twins, as a\nsuccessful businessman whose name graced his company\u2019s headquarters. A white\nexecutive insisted that no one would believe a Black man could be a\nmillionaire. Ray\u2019s corporate business would have to become a limousine\nservice.\n\n[Read: The unsung legacy of Black characters on soap\noperas](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/03/soap-operas-\nthe-forgotten-birthplace-of-complex-black-characters-on-tv/388907/)\n\nIn part because of his landmark \u201990s productions, Bass told me, he hears from\na lot of aspiring Black screenwriters, who at last have a significant cadre of\nBlack creators they can reach out to for career advice. For Bass and for\nothers who elbowed into the industry at a time when there were far fewer\nopportunities, mentoring a new generation of talent is both a responsibility\nand a challenge. \u201cI feel for each and every one of them,\u201d Bass said. He tries\nto help as much as he can, but he noted another reality: \u201cIf I spent my time\nfocused on what everyone is trying to get me to do, well, I wouldn\u2019t have time\nto do what I do.\u201d\n\nSome of the biggest changes Bass has seen in the industry are tied to the\nsuccess of one woman: Shonda Rhimes. Rhimes came to television from the\nmovies; she wrote her first TV pilot for ABC in 2003. The network didn\u2019t move\nforward with that series, about female war correspondents, but it did take an\ninterest in her next idea: a drama set in a Seattle hospital. _Grey\u2019s Anatomy_\nbecame an immediate hit\u2014it is still on the air after an astonishing 17\nseasons\u2014and one of the rare major network shows led by a Black showrunner. It\nfollows a diverse group of doctors navigating chaos both medical and\ninterpersonal. The staff of Seattle Grace Hospital rarely deals with capital-\n_I_ Issues of race or gender; more often, they are just trying to keep their\npatients alive and their relationships afloat. _Grey\u2019s Anatomy_ isn\u2019t a \u201cBlack\nshow\u201d\u2014it is a mainstream hit that has made careers (Ellen Pompeo, Sandra Oh,\nJesse Williams). By 2014 Rhimes had three shows airing back-to-back on\nThursday evenings on ABC: _Grey\u2019s Anatomy_ ; the political drama _Scandal_ ,\nstarring Kerry Washington; and the legal mystery _How to Get Away With Murder_\n, starring Viola Davis. For a time, Rhimes was producing roughly 70 hours\u2019\nworth of television annually and generating more than $2 billion a year for\nDisney, which owns ABC.\n\nRhimes has spoken about [her dislike of the word\n_diversity_](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/11/behind-\nthe-scenes-in-shondaland/415107/), noting that her emphasis on creating\ncomplex characters of color, especially women, shouldn\u2019t be thought of as\nsomething out of the ordinary. It is merely a reflection of the world around\nher. But by television standards, Rhimes\u2019s approach\u2014demanding a multiethnic\nensemble in her writers\u2019 room as well as on-screen\u2014was remarkable, and had\nobservable consequences. In the years following her breakaway success, the\nindustry green-lit a wave of new series by and about people of color, a\nseismic change that has been called \u201cthe Shonda effect.\u201d\n\nOne of those series was _Black-ish_ , created by Kenya Barris. The show\ncenters on Dre Johnson (Anthony Anderson) and his biracial wife, Rainbow\n(Tracee Ellis Ross), as they raise their children in a predominantly white,\nupper-middle-class neighborhood. If the milieu resembles that of _The Cosby\nShow_ , the similarities end there. Its writers\u2019 room has been staffed mostly\nwith people of color. And from its inception, in 2014, the series has tackled\nsocial issues head-on, mining family-friendly yet acerbic humor from subjects\nsuch as gun control, class inequality, and the question of who can use the\nN-word.\n\nPeter Saji wrote for _Black-ish_ and went on to co-create the spin-off _Mixed-\nish_ , about Rainbow\u2019s childhood. Earlier in his career, Saji had written for\nother series with less diverse writers\u2019 rooms, and he recounted for me an\nincident that typified the experience. On his first day on a series, a veteran\nwhite writer told a joke in which the punch line was a white woman calling a\nBlack performer the N-word. To Saji, it felt like a test, as if his reaction\nwould determine whether he\u2019d be welcome in the room. \u201cThat was like my Jackie\nRobinson moment, right? Like, _I just got cleated\u2014how do I take this?_ \u201d he\nremembered thinking. He didn\u2019t voice his discomfort. \u201cIn that moment, I felt\nlike, _I understand psychologically what you\u2019re trying to do_. And as fucked-\nup as it is, the onus is on me to do well and not blow this opportunity for\neveryone that\u2019s coming behind me.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, the _Black-ish_ writers\u2019 room was, in Saji\u2019s words, his Hollywood\nHBCU. Saji felt he had space to hone his craft and to dramatize the challenges\nhe and others in the room had faced in their personal and professional lives.\nThe series also responded, in something like real time, to the world around\nit. In 2016, it [aired an episode titled\n\u201cHope,\u201d](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/02/black-ish-\ndiscusses-police-brutality/470922/) in which the family learns of the shooting\nof a Black man by a white police officer. The incident is fictional, but the\nscript evokes the real-life deaths of Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, and Sandra\nBland; Barris has said that the episode was inspired by his struggle to\nexplain the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, to his own\nchildren. Dre and \u201cBow\u201d differ over how to help their children process the\nshooting\u2014and the eventual acquittal of the police officer. Dre insists that\nthe police are an instrument of systemic racism, and the couple\u2019s children\n\u201cneed to know the world that they\u2019re living in\u201d as young Black people. Bow\ntries to find a way to condemn the violence while preserving their children\u2019s\ninnocence so they can \u201cbe kids for a little while longer.\u201d Barris\u2019s\nsensibilities are idiosyncratic, and the series doesn\u2019t always achieve its\naims (or land its jokes). But \u201cHope\u201d is a \u201cvery special episode\u201d that manages,\ndespite some awkward moments, to tackle a serious issue without making the\nentire viewing experience feel like a lesson, or a sermon.\n\n[Read: _Black-ish_ and how to talk to kids about police\nbrutality](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/02/black-\nish-discusses-police-brutality/470922/)\n\nCompared with the handling of police brutality in _Family Matters_ two decades\nearlier, \u201cHope\u201d looks like a great leap forward. Yet Saji noted that \u201cHope\u201d\ncould happen only because earlier shows had introduced white viewers to the\nsubject. Many of the writers of _Black-ish_ were aware of the work that shows\nsuch as _A Different World_ and even _Family Matters_ had done to clear some\nof that space for their own series. The treatment of police violence in\n_Family Matters_ may have been far from perfect, Saji observed, but \u201cI know\nthe kinds of fights they would\u2019ve had to have to even do that.\u201d\n\n### VI. \u201cDon\u2019t You Have Enough?\u201d\n\nDespite the acclaim _Black-ish_ earned for its unflinching treatment of\nrace\u2014no less a TV critic than Michelle Obama told Anderson it was her favorite\nshow\u2014Barris felt constrained by ABC and its parent company, Disney. In one\ninstance, he was asked\u2014and agreed\u2014to put aside a story line based on the\narrest of Henry Louis Gates outside the Harvard professor\u2019s home. In 2017,\nBarris produced an episode\u2014\u201cPlease, Baby, Please\u201d\u2014that explored the fear many\nBlack Americans felt following the election of Donald Trump. The episode was\nshelved after a weeks-long battle that eventually involved Disney CEO Bob Iger\nhimself. Barris and ABC framed the decision as an issue of \u201ccreative\ndifferences,\u201d but some in the industry believed the network objected to the\nepisode\u2019s positive treatment of the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had been\nkneeling during the national anthem before football games to protest police\nviolence against Black Americans. (ABC denied this explanation.) Barris\nultimately left ABC for Netflix with three years left in his network contract.\n\nEven Rhimes, the most successful showrunner of her generation, eventually came\nto feel stifled by network television. Last year, she told _The Hollywood\nReporter_ that her later years with ABC [had been filled with\nconflict](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/shonda-\nrhimes-is-ready-to-own-her-s-the-game-changing-showrunner-on-leaving-abc-\nculture-shock-at-netflix-and-overcoming-her-fears-4079375/) over content,\nbudgets, and even her support of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. But\nthe breaking point came in 2017, when a Disney executive balked at her request\nfor an additional pass to Disneyland. \u201cDon\u2019t you have enough?\u201d he reportedly\nasked. Soon after, [Rhimes signed a nine-figure deal with\nNetflix](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/08/what-\nnetflix-can-offer-shonda-rhimes/537738/).\n\n![Stills from the shows 'Scandal,' 'Black-ish,' and\n'Insecure'](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'\nviewBox='0 0 655 1132' /%3E)The success of Shonda Rhimes shows like _Scandal_\n( _top_ ) helped pave the way for series like _Black-ish_ ( _middle_ ) and\nlater _Insecure_ ( _bottom_ ). Yet even as Black writers and producers have\nbeen afforded more opportunities, they continue to hit the same walls. (Danny\nFeld / ABC / Everett Collection; Kelsey McNeal / ABC / Everett Collection;\nLisa Rose / HBO / Everett Collection)\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Black writers and producers are heading to Netflix, Amazon\nPrime Video, and other streaming platforms: The business model of streaming\ndoesn\u2019t depend as heavily on ratings. In essence, these platforms are selling\ngift baskets of content; all they need is for subscribers to want one thing in\nthe basket. Darnell Hunt is a professor and dean at UCLA and the lead author\nof the \u201cHollywood Diversity Report.\u201d \u201cWhen you buy a subscription to Hulu or\nNetflix or Amazon Prime or whatever it is,\u201d he told me, \u201cyou get everything\nthey offer. So from their perspective, the broader their portfolio of titles,\nthe better. If they have a show that African Americans really, really like in\na cultlike fashion, and no one else likes, the show may be retained anyway if\nit draws in enough Black subscribers who might not otherwise subscribe to the\nplatform.\u201d\n\nFrom Rhimes, of course, Netflix hoped for a demographic-spanning hit, which it\ngot in the form of _Bridgerton_. The Regency-era romance series, based on the\nnovels by Julia Quinn, is the platform\u2019s most popular original show ever,\npulling in viewers from an astounding 82 million households in its first 28\ndays on the site. From other Black writers and producers, however, the company\nis happy to have a series that has the niche appeal of a \u201990s-era Black\nsitcom. Indeed, streaming services have been snapping up the distribution\nrights to series from that decade. Last summer, Netflix announced that it\nwould be streaming a collection of Black sitcoms from the \u201990s, _Sister,\nSister_ and _Moesha_ among them. Hulu put new emphasis on its \u201cBlack Stories\u201d\nhub, which features shows such as _The Jeffersons_ , _Living Single_ , and\n_Family Matters_. In August 2020, the Disney-owned streaming service even\naired the Trump-themed episode of _Black-ish_ that had been too hot for ABC\nthree years earlier.\n\nAnd yet Black writers and showrunners say they still hit the same old walls.\nIssa Rae first attracted industry interest after her YouTube series [_The\nMisadventures of Awkward Black Girl_](http://awkwardblackgirl.com/) became an\nunexpected hit. In that low-budget comedy, which premiered in 2011, Rae plays\na woman named J who makes it through the drudgeries of her post-college life\nin Los Angeles in part by rapping to herself in a mirror for confidence\nboosts. The show was delightfully silly and drew a large, dedicated audience.\nRae\u2019s J wasn\u2019t a hypersexual reality star; she wasn\u2019t the silent or sassy best\nfriend of a white protagonist. She was, like the _Different World_ and _Living\nSingle_ characters before her, just a young Black woman trying to figure\nherself out. But when Rae was approached about turning the viral hit into a\ntelevision series, she was continually told by non-Black Hollywood executives\nthat her stories weren\u2019t truly reflective of Black experiences. Perhaps they\ndoubted that huge numbers of educated Black women existed (Rae is a Stanford\ngraduate) or were worth catering to. Perhaps they wanted to stress just one\nfacet of Blackness that resonated with them, rather than portraying fully\nrounded Black characters. At the time, Rae was \u201cdeathly afraid of losing an\nopportunity by being a bit too authentic\u201d\u2014too much the person she actually\nwas.\n\n[From the May 2018 issue: An interview with Issa\nRae](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/05/issa-rae-\ninsecure/556880/)\n\nIn the end, Rae was able to portray those fully rounded characters; she had\n[amassed enough\ninfluence](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/05/issa-rae-\ninsecure/556880/) by then. Her [friendship-focused HBO dramedy,\n_Insecure_](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/10/insecure-\nhbo-review/503363/), which finished filming its fifth and final season earlier\nthis year, follows two Black women in L.A. as they navigate the romantic and\nprofessional pitfalls of their late 20s and early 30s. The women certainly\ncontend with racism and sexism in their lives, but, crucially, those issues\naren\u2019t the focus of the series. Some of the best episodes came in the fourth\nseason, when Issa (played by Rae) and Molly (Yvonne Orji) drift apart in the\npainful, all-too-common way of early-30s friendships. The show\u2019s emotional\ncenter of gravity is the love (and sometimes the enmity) they have for each\nother. Their falling-out sometimes feels more dramatic than most real-life\ndisputes among friends\u2014this is, after all, television\u2014but _Insecure_\naccomplished the rare feat of being a series that depicts Black life without\npathologizing or feeling burdened by it.\n\nDecades ago, Black visionaries were up against both market forces and\ncorporate resistance. But demographics have changed, and so has popular taste.\n\nIn some ways, Rae\u2019s early experience is typical for Black writers today. Many\nTV viewers first met Lena Waithe when she played Denise on Aziz Ansari\u2019s\n_Master of None_. Waithe wrote [one of the show\u2019s most popular\nepisodes](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/05/master-of-\nnone-season-2/525804/), in 2017, based on her own coming-out story, and it\nwould win her an Emmy. By then, she\u2019d begun to produce _The Chi_ , a drama for\nShowtime set in her native Chicago. It was a great opportunity, but like Rae,\nWaithe found that her vision was circumscribed by the executives to whom she\nhad to answer. \u201cNobody knew who I was, and there were still a lot of men\u2014a lot\nof white men\u2014who were in charge, and I just didn\u2019t have any power,\u201d Waithe\nsays of her earliest days working on the show. \u201cAnd then I won an Emmy and\nthen all of a sudden they\u2019re like, \u2018Okay, you can be in charge now.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe creator of _Julia_ , Hal Kanter, had demanded entertainment, not agony.\nFifty years later, Black writers and producers are more likely to encounter\nthe opposite problem. The Black stories that studios, networks, and streaming\nplatforms feel most comfortable adding to their slates require writers to\nexplore\u2014and sometimes re-create\u2014racial traumas. Following the killing of\nMichael Brown, a cottage industry of police-brutality dramas popped up. Fox\nhad _Shots Fired_ , which begins with a Black police officer shooting an\nunarmed white college student; in Netflix\u2019s _Seven Seconds_ , a white police\nofficer fatally strikes a Black teen cyclist with his car. Rae relayed the\nexperience of a fellow Black writer with a series in the works: \u201cIn the\ndevelopment process, they just kept on increasing the trauma to make it feel\nlike it was worth watching,\u201d she told me. Racist violence as a plot device\nhasn\u2019t been restricted to realist dramas; it extends into genre works as well.\nThe Spike Lee\u2013produced Netflix sci-fi film _See You Yesterday_ follows a young\nBlack science prodigy who creates a time machine\u2014in order to save her brother,\nwho was killed by a police officer. And then there\u2019s the new horror anthology\nseries _Them_ on Prime Video. The show follows a Black family that moves into\na white neighborhood in the 1950s; its animating terror is the lengths white\npeople will go to in order to preserve housing segregation. When the trailer\nwas released in March, many Black viewers groaned. Why are Black characters\nalways subjected to racism, even in genre productions? Can\u2019t we have a Black\n_Jeepers Creepers_?\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re still telling stories that are so focused on trauma, we\u2019re\nactually still telling stories about white supremacy,\u201d Tara Duncan, the\npresident of Freeform, Disney\u2019s young-adult-targeted cable network, told me\nwhen we met for coffee in New York City\u2019s West Village recently. \u201cWe\u2019re not\ntalking about what our lives are like and how we see the world and our hopes\nand dreams and goals and imagination. We\u2019re still talking about what life\nlooks like in proximity to whiteness.\u201d\n\nIn May, Duncan also became the president of Onyx Collective, Disney\u2019s new\ncontent brand for creators of color. She is one of the few Black executives in\nan industry that remains dominated by white men. A [2021 study by\nMcKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-\ninclusion/black-representation-in-film-and-tv-the-challenges-and-impact-of-\nincreasing-diversity) found that the bulk of opportunities afforded to Black\noffscreen talent comes from shows with at least one Black person in a senior\nrole. In other words, the work of bringing on people from historically\nmarginalized groups routinely falls to people from those same marginalized\ngroups. Black people who do make it into the business are shouldering the\nburden of diversifying the entire industry. Yvette Lee Bowser, who recently\ndeveloped and produced the Harlem-centric ensemble dramedy _Run the World_ ,\ntakes that responsibility seriously: \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I started\ncreating shows. I could actually create my own work environment and kind of\ndictate the DNA of the room and the experience that people were having in the\nroom.\u201d\n\nBut for all the prominence of Shonda Rhimes and Kenya Barris, as well as Tyler\nPerry, who heads his own studio in Atlanta, only 5 percent of TV showrunners\nare Black, according to the McKinsey study. As for the executive suite, Duncan\nand the new chair of Warner Bros. Television Group, Channing Dungey, are the\nexceptions. \u201cMost everywhere else you look, it\u2019s a white male,\u201d UCLA\u2019s Darnell\nHunt observed. The handful of Black people with real power can\u2019t undo decades\nof inequity.\n\nPerhaps for the first time, however, an alignment of forces may now be bending\ntoward something better. Decades ago, Black visionaries were up against both\nmarket factors and corporate resistance\u2014not a fair fight. But demographics\nhave changed, and so have public opinion and popular taste. For cable shows in\nparticular, ratings among all young viewers, not just those reflecting Black,\nLatino, or Asian households, are at all-time highs for shows with \u201cmajority\nminority\u201d casts\u2014shows such as _Insecure_ , Donald Glover\u2019s _Atlanta_ , and the\nMindy Kaling\u2013produced coming-of-age series _Never Have I Ever_. The television\nshows driving consistent interactions on Twitter and Instagram\u2014a new coin of\nthe realm in the industry, now that so much TV watching occurs on so-called\nsecond screens\u2014are those with casts and writers\u2019 rooms that more closely\nresemble the diversity of America.\n\nTo succeed in the country as it\u2019s evolving, traditional networks and streaming\nplatforms will need to do more than release statements about their commitment\nto principles of diversity and inclusion, or to aggregate their \u201cBlack\nStories\u201d or present viewers with a \u201cBlack Lives Matter Collection.\u201d For\nchanges to last, executives and other industry power brokers need to continue\ninvesting in creative visions that don\u2019t match their own. They\u2019ll have to cede\nthe terms of \u201cauthenticity,\u201d and any negotiations over it, to the Black\ncreators whose voices have too long been ignored.

Some connect climate change to it with\nmelting ice poles and greenhouse gases being emitted obviously uncontrolled to\nour atmosphere. We all know the pictures of suffering and dead animals with\nlarge amounts of plastic and other garbage in their insides. Others build a\nconnection towards technology and investments needed in infrastructure and\ninnovation, to overcome the obvious challenges ahead. There are those worried\nabout the future of a polluted planet for themselves, their own and other\nchildren, while many of us struggle with a different, very personal conflict:\nWhat to buy, how to live, and how to make a change.\n\nIn the end it results in every one\u2019s individual thinking and behavior. It\nworks in us continuously, until we make a decision - and beyond. 2021 will\nstick in our memory as the year of wildfires, floodings, droughts, storms, and\nsnow or massive hail in regions and times and dimensions we certainly were not\nexpecting. This is one of the reasons, why the current situation is a\nchallenge not comparable to anything before.\n\n## Business Struggle\n\nThe 17 Sustainable Development Goals, adopted by all United Nations member\nstates in 2015, clearly lead the path to go. Thanks to efforts by the United\nNations, generating transparency and offering bold education courses, more and\nmore people get a better understanding on how important it is, and how to act\nnow. Also, alliances and loud voices of all kinds of people are helping the\nworld talking about sustainability and recognizing that there is no time left.\nInvestment firms are setting the rules, forcing companies to become more\nsustainable - change is slipping into gear.\n\nAnd yet, many businesses still look at it with a project and cost oriented\nperspective. Tools are dictating the agenda as they alone would change\nanything. Such a perspective entails the risk of doing the minimum, cheapest\nand fastest to avoid disruptions and too much noise.\n\nThis is not what is needed to make a significant impact, and it is likely that\nit will add very limited value to businesses, since what we are facing is too\nbig to be solved by a project, a measure or a tool. It requires a mindset\nmany, if not most businesses are not used to. It requires a kind of\ncollaboration which goes beyond direct sales of products, sales-figures,\nfeatures & functions and outdated performance indicators. It is natural that\ncosts must be controlled, as revenue is what pays our bills. Why not look at\ncosts from a different angle, an investment angle? An investment into the\ncompany\u2019s future. The current situation is not a hype, it won\u2019t disappear, and\nit might get worse if operating models and business practices are not changed\ndetermined.\n\n\n\n**\u201cNo company, no government, no country will solve the greatest challenges of\nour time alone!** **We need to move from ego-systems to eco-systems and\noperate in networks.\u200b\u201d**\n\n_Christian Klein, CEO of SAP_\n\n\n\nThe world became more complex. While transparency makes it easy for consumers\nto understand who or what is behind a product, what good or harm it causes and\nto mobilize others to join the motion, on the other side a $2 dollar item is\nshipped around the planet without one knowing it. The decision to buy a shirt,\na car, to travel by plane or to use a virtual meeting instead, can be made on\nthe spot, and more and more the sustainability footprint has a leading role in\nthis decision process. We, the consumers, are influencing supply chains more\nthan ever, because we have the choice, access to insights and education, and\nwe have the power to mobilize and influence others with just a few clicks. In\n2019 Gartner predicted that in the next 10 years, circular economies will\nreplace linear economies.\n\nThat is why measuring business outcomes needs to be revised, as new metrics\nand influencers joined the game. It needs a bigger look to understand the\ndynamics and to tie it back to own operations and actions. The question how to\nmake a quick Dollar cannot be the leading question anymore. Instead, a\nsustainability driven approach, incorporating eco-systems with a bold end-to-\nend understanding, is required. The challenge here is not only inside a\ncompany, but especially with focus on stake- and shareholders. Although plenty\nof actions were kicked off by finance markets, there is still a way to go.\n\n  * $90t to be invested in climate-smart infrastructure by 2030\n  * 60+ carbon pricing initiatives in force or scheduled for implementation\n  * Sustainability counts as #1 concern amongst Millennial and Gen Z jobseekers\u200b\n\nAs a businessperson, ask yourself:\n\n  * How much do you know about your customers sustainability strategy and challenges?\n  * How is your product or your service tied into the strategy?\n  * Which hidden super-power can you unleash to add reliable and reusable sustainability metrics?\n  * Where are your limitations and what or who is needed to think in end-to-end scenarios?\n  * What makes you a valuable contributor, not easy to replace, and how can you measure it?\n  * How will consumers perceive the results of the whole supply chain and how will this impact your business?\n\n## Eco-Systems And Its Magic\n\nIn 2019 already, the Ellen Mac Arthur foundation came to the conclusion, that\n45% of CO2 emissions can be tackled by transforming the way goods are made and\nused. There is such a massive load of information science and professionals\ngathered in the past years, and yet the world is waiting to adapt accordingly.\nImagine what could possibly happen by uniting behind the science, together and\nwith purpose.\n\nThe power of eco-systems is widely underestimated, not saying that the eco-\nsystem model is easy to adapt. Maybe it has to with its closeness to typical\npartner networks, which are built on contracts and Service Level Agreements,\nresulting in services or projects (services for money). This is business as we\nknow it for ages.\n\nAn eco-system can be a club of problem-solving actors who are bringing their\nskills to the table. They are not acting limited by their regular business\nmodel, but instead delivering their power into the bigger picture, the task at\nhand. A contract is not the first thing they discuss. They are not the\nrecipients of demand lists; these lists are created together. Revenue comes\neither from existing business practices or as result of the larger solution in\nterms of proportionate shares or other creative benefits and earnings.\n\nOperating in such an eco-system enables members with a much larger view on the\nproblem to be solved. Experts are in the midst of activities. Imagine the\npower such an eco-system would deliver, the spark of change it could initiate.\n\n## #Sustain4Profit\n\nThe loyalty of customers, for most businesses, is imperative for profitable\ngrowth and surviving in a red ocean, crowded with competition and regulatory.\nIn the meanwhile, it is broad consent, that in order to generate loyal\ncustomers, one must go the extra mile beyond customer satisfaction.\n\nWhile the B2B world is changing in their daily operation routines,\nunderstanding even better the customer challenges beyond product and\nperformance, a new business impacting indicator is here to stay \u2013\nsustainability. And with it, the consumer gets very close to business\noperations of typically far away industries. The chain of causality cannot be\nignored, as the single product one produces, can turn the scale of buy or no-\nbuy.\n\nThe perfect product in future might be the one, where everybody along the\nvalue chain offers full transparency, where the sustainability footprint at\nleast is neutral, and where the feeling caused by buying it, cannot be toped.\nSuch a chain can do big. Do no harm is not enough anymore and bad reputation\nin such a chain will not be tolerated.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    If you feel inspired, and ideas are popping up, feel free to connect and \r\n    to discuss, to inspire and to generate ideas for sustainable solutions.\n\nFollow __Like __RSS Feed\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.sap.com%2F2021%2F09%2F13%2Fsustainability-\ncustomer-loyalty-and-why-eco-systems-matter%2F \"Share on\nFacebook\")[](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.sap.com%2F2021%2F09%2F13%2Fsustainability-\ncustomer-loyalty-and-why-eco-systems-\nmatter%2F&text=Sustainability%2C+Customer+Loyalty+and+why+Eco-Systems+matter\n\"Share on\nTwitter\")[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.sap.com%2F2021%2F09%2F13%2Fsustainability-\ncustomer-loyalty-and-why-eco-systems-\nmatter%2F&title=Sustainability%2C+Customer+Loyalty+and+why+Eco-Systems+matter\n\"Share on LinkedIn\")\n\nAlert Moderator\n\nAlerting is not available for unauthorized users\n\n### Assigned tags\n\nSimilar Blog Posts __\n\nRelated Questions __\n\nBe the first to leave a comment\n\nYou must be [Logged on](https://blogs.sap.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=2021/09/13/sustainability-customer-loyalty-and-why-eco-\nsystems-matter \"Log On\") to comment or reply to a post.\n\n##### Find us on\n\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/sapcommunity \"Facebook\")\n  * [](https://twitter.com/SAPCommunity \"Twitter\")\n  * [](https://www.youtube.com/c/SAPCommunities \"YouTube\")\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sap \"LinkedIn\")\n  * [](https://instagram.com/sap/ \"Instagram\")\n  * [](http://www.slideshare.net/SAP \"Slideshare\")\n  * [](mailto:?subject='SAP Community' \"Email Share\")\n\n  * [Privacy](http://sap.com/about/legal/privacy.html)\n  * [Terms of Use](http://sap.com/corporate/en/legal/terms-of-use.html)\n  * [Legal Disclosure](http://sap.com/about/legal/impressum.html)\n  * [Copyright](http://sap.com/about/legal/copyright.html)\n  * [Trademark](http://sap.com/about/legal/trademark.html)\n  *   * [Newsletter](https://www.sap.com/cmp/nl/sap-community-voice/index.html)\n  * [Support](mailto:sapnetwork@sap.com)\n\n"}

Since\n1965, the candidate elected in Peterborough\u2013Kawartha has almost always been a\nmember of the party that went on to form the government.\n\nConservative Michelle Ferreri, who runs a social media marketing company and\nwas a former TV anchor, is hoping to be Monsef's foil in a riding with both a\nlarge urban core and rural areas.\n\n![](https://i.cbc.ca/1.5471715.1631480004!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/minister-\nfor-women-and-gender-equality-and-rural-economic-development-maryam-monsef-\nlistens-to-researchers-at-the-university-of-guelph-on-friday-feb-21-2020.jpg)\n\nLiberal incumbent Maryam Monsef is trying to hold on to Peterborough\u2013Kawartha\nfor a third election. (Kate Bueckert/CBC)\n\nHer campaign hasn't been smooth sailing though. Ferreri made headlines over\nthe weekend when she visited a retirement home despite not yet being fully\nvaccinated.\n\nThe Bloc is looking to stem the ambitions of two cabinet ministers.\n\nTreasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos won the Quebec City of riding of\nQu\u00e9bec by under one per cent last time. The Bloc is running Louis Sansfa\u00e7on, a\nformer member of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec who was sentenced to seven years in\nprison for possession and trafficking of narcotics in the early 1990s.

She squeaked out a win\nin 2019 by a slim margin.\n\n## Collapse of the Greens\n\nThe 2019 election proved historic for the Greens when voters sent three MPs to\nthe House of Commons. This year could be historic for another reason.\n\nWhen the election was called, the Greens were still trying to shrug off\nnegative press that suggested the party was imploding following a public fight\n.\n\nLeader Annamie Paul is in a rematch for Toronto Centre with star Liberal\ncandidate Marci Ien, who won the Liberal fortress in a byelection last\nOctober.\n\n  * [Annamie Paul's Greens can turn page on party turmoil with a few more seats, analysts say](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/annamie-paul-green-election-1.6139001)\n\n  * [AnalysisAnnamie Paul is leading the Green Party's national campaign \u2014 but hasn't left Toronto once](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/annamie-paul-green-party-federal-election-1.6162700)\n\nPaul has mainly run a local campaign, spending the vast majority of her time\nin the riding instead of travelling to campaign with candidates across the\ncountry. While she has received favourable reviews for her debate performance,\nher path to Ottawa remains very much an uphill battle.\n\nThe NDP will be looking to capitalize on the Green's poor poll performance to\nsteal back the B.C. riding of Nanaimo\u2013Ladysmith from Paul Manly.\n\nAcross the country, Fredericton, the party's lone win outside of Vancouver\nIsland, is also in jeopardy after former Green Jenica Atwin crossed the floor\nto the Liberals this year, citing distractions within the party, including\ninternal disagreements on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n![](https://i.cbc.ca/1.6061210.1623358037!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/jenica-\natwin-liberal-presser.JPG)\n\nFredericton MP Jenica Atwin announced in June that she was leaving the federal\nGreen Party to sit as a Liberal.

Law professor Nicole O'Byrne, who had worked on Atwin's 2019 campaign,\nis hoping to keep the riding Green with a new face, while Conservative Party\ncandidate Andrea Johnson will be watching for a vote split.\n\n## Will Layton's orange wave legacy be gone?\n\nIn his first campaign at the helm, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh saw his party drop\nto fourth place behind the Bloc. This time round the party is polling in third\nplace and Singh is enjoying a person rise in popularity.\n\nBut Quebec, where the party fell to one seat, remains a struggle as Jack\nLayton's 2011 Orange Crush fades into the history books.\n\n  * ['Wildcards': Jagmeet Singh's New Democrats say they're running to win an election they didn't want](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jagmeet-singh-ndp-election-1.6138508)\n\n  * [Jagmeet Singh seen as most competent and trustworthy leader: Vote Compass](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/vote-compass-leaders-scored-on-competence-and-trust-1.6168515)\n\nWith the party languishing behind the Liberals, Bloc and Conservatives in\npolling in the province, it's at risk of getting shut out.\n\nThe lone man standing, Alexandre Boulerice, is in a fight to keep his\nRosemont\u2013La Petite-Patrie seat and make sure the party doesn't lose its\nfooting.\n\nFormer NDP MP Ruth-Ellen Brosseau is hoping to turn the party's fortunes and\nis running again in her old riding of Berthier\u2013Maskinong\u00e9.

The Liberals finished in third last time, but by only about\n1,000 votes.\n\nAnother tight race in British Columbia last election was Coquitlam\u2013Port\nCoquitlam, where Liberal Ron McKinnon won by just under 400 votes.\n\nThe Conservatives are hoping to pick this riding up from the Liberals in their\nrace to government.\n\nThe Conservatives were nipping at the Liberals' ankles in the Ontario riding\nof Niagara Centre last election, finishing in second with about 31 per cent of\nthe vote to incumbent Liberal [Vance\nBadawey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vance_Badawey)'s 35 per cent.\n\n## Misconduct allegations\n\nA notable riding to watch will be Kitchener Centre.

opponents: corporate business\nlobbies that claim to support action on climate change.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable and the National Association\nof Manufacturers all support the much smaller bipartisan infrastructure bill\nchampioned by the Biden White House, which includes tens of billions of\ndollars for responding to climate disasters and promoting green power. They\nalso backed billions in new spending last year for wind, solar and renewable\nenergy.\n\nBut the same business groups have taken a hard line against the Democrats\u2019\n$3.5 trillion plan, which would raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations\nwhile tackling causes such as health care, child care and racial equity in\naddition to climate change. The groups are sticking with that position even as\nsome of their own members, such as Pfizer, Microsoft and Bank of America, have\ncriticized them for doing too little on climate.\n\nEnvironmentalists and their supporters in Congress have a message for those\ncompanies: Pick a side. With much of the country still recovering from the\ndeath and wreckage of Hurricane Ida and after a summer of heat waves and\nwildfires across the globe, they are promising that businesses will face\nlasting repercussions to their reputations if they waffle on what could be\ntheir best opportunity to take on climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really hard test for corporations: Was it all bullshit?\u201d said Lori\nLodes, executive director of Climate Power, a group whose leaders include\nveterans of Hillary Clinton\u2019s and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaigns.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one train and you\u2019re either getting on it or we will have a really\nlong, long memory.\u201d\n\nActivist groups have also warned privately that companies belonging to the\nChamber and Business Roundtable could lose their place in business climate\ncoalitions before the United Nations\u2019 talks on global warming begin in\nNovember, an adviser to those coalitions told POLITICO. If they want to avoid\nthat public rebuke, they need to formally distance themselves from the\nlobbying groups, said the adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity to\nspeak candidly.\n\nSuch efforts may be starting to produce cracks in the trade organizations.\nSome companies that belong to the Chamber are composing a letter publicly\ncriticizing the lobby\u2019s stance on climate grounds, three people with knowledge\nof the effort told POLITICO.\n\nBut the Chamber says it\u2019s not backing down in opposing the $3.5 trillion\npackage, which Democrats are still assembling from a series of drafts and\nskeletal proposals in multiple House committees.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a climate bill; it is an everything and the kitchen sink bill,\u201d\nChamber chief policy officer Neil Bradley said in an emailed statement. \u201cOne\nlook at the committee drafts that have been released shows that it is\nliterally every policy that the majority hasn\u2019t been able to enact because\nthey lack sufficient support all rolled into one bill. We are not going to\nsolve climate change or any other policy problem that way.\u201d\n\nJust a handful of votes in either the House or Senate could doom the bill \u2014\nwhich has both factions banging down the doors of just a clutch of lawmakers\nin a lobbying frenzy. The results will not only shape the size of government\nand define how much spending the nation\u2019s legislative body can stomach, but\nalso whether the U.S. can credibly achieve President Joe Biden\u2019s goal for a\nmajor cut in greenhouse gas output during this decade.\n\nAt least a few companies are trying to stake out a middle ground, distancing\ntheir own views on the bill from the Chamber\u2019s without attacking the group.\nThose include the software giant Salesforce.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s position on the [$3.5 trillion] reconciliation\npackage does not reflect Salesforce\u2019s perspective on the need for immediate\nand bold climate action,\u201d Patrick Flynn, the company\u2019s head of global\nsustainability, said in a statement. \u201cWe are actively working to improve the\nChamber\u2019s position on climate.\u201d\n\nThose kinds of statements won\u2019t wash, said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a\nclimate advocate who says companies should quit their trade groups if they\u2019re\nserious about their rhetoric around climate change.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a load of crap and I think they know it,\u201d Whitehouse told POLITICO of\nthose statements. \u201cCorporate America built the largest and most powerful\nlobbying apparatus in history, which now dominates Congress \u2014 and they built\nit for a reason. ... They know perfectly well that what other little\nstatements they might make aren\u2019t going to stand against the pressure of the\napparatus that they built.\u201d\n\nOther companies say they cannot back the Democrats\u2019 bill, despite supporting\naggressive action to slash greenhouse gases.\n\nHugh Welsh, president of the chemicals and pharmaceuticals company DSM North\nAmerica, said that although he is pushing the Chamber to bolster its climate\nposition, he agreed with its stance that it\u2019s unwise for Democrats to try to\nforce the bill through Congress on party-line votes using budget\nreconciliation. He said such a partisan process could lead to a Republican-led\nCongress repealing the bill later. In addition, he said the bill\u2019s tax\nincreases could outweigh climate incentives and benefits.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s parts of it that I do support, there\u2019s parts of it I don\u2019t,\u201d Welsh\nsaid of the bill. \u201cWe\u2019re being told by the White House you\u2019re either for\neverything or you\u2019re for nothing. That\u2019s a difficult position to be in when\nit\u2019s everything and the kitchen sink.\u201d\n\nThe forces arrayed against the bill\u2019s revenue-raising provisions are potent,\nsaid Alex Flint, executive director of the free-market climate group Alliance\nfor Market Solutions. \u201cWe all talk about lobbies in Washington for one reason\nor another, but the \u2018don\u2019t raise my taxes lobby\u2019 is very powerful. And that\nlobby is coming out in full force with reconciliation.\u201d\n\nBesides being too partisan to endure, NAM, the Business Roundtable and the\nChamber said the corporate tax increases and other measures likely needed to\npay for the provisions would ding U.S. competitiveness while hitting\nconsumers.\n\n\u201cAs the House advances the process for a budget reconciliation package,\nBusiness Roundtable remains deeply concerned about potential tax increases on\nU.S. job creators that would counteract the benefits of infrastructure\ninvestment,\u201d the Business Roundtable said in a statement.\n\nTime for taking a stand is growing short. The House faces a Sept. 27 deadline\nfor a crucial vote on the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which includes $550\nbillion in new spending. That bill\u2019s fate is yoked to that of the $3.5\ntrillion reconciliation package, and liberal and moderate Democrats have\njousted for months about which bill Congress should enact first.\n\nPeople working with business-oriented climate groups have told companies that\nthey also have a Sept. 27 deadline, the climate business adviser said: By\nthen, they must publicly support the reconciliation bill\u2019s climate goals and\ncommit to opposing lobbying that would topple revenue-raising provisions, such\nas corporate tax increases.\n\n\u201cMeetings have happened and are happening with major companies,\u201d the person\nsaid. \u201cThe ask has been made.\u201d\n\nThe reconciliation bill would include hundreds of billions in climate\nspending, such as renewable energy tax credits, incentives to purchase and\nmanufacture electric vehicles, money to improve home energy efficiency and\npenalties for fossil fuel companies for their planet-heating pollution,\naccording to proposals Democrats have floated. The House Energy and Commerce\nCommittee will hold a markup Monday on many of the key climate provisions.\n\nMeanwhile, environmental groups and other progressive organizations are\nworking to prevent any of their own potential rifts \u2014 especially if efforts by\nmoderate Democrats to lower the bill\u2019s price tag forces Congress to choose\nbetween the package\u2019s climate, health and social spending initiatives.\n\nGreen activists are also struggling to keep their allies in the Democratic\nParty, who control the House, Senate and White House, in line to deliver on\ntheir climate promises.\n\nThe Sunrise Movement and other progressive groups are plotting events\nthroughout the country on Sept. 20 to pressure Democrats, including on Capitol\nHill as well as protests in Arizona aimed at Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and one in\nCalifornia for Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Sinema and fellow moderate Democratic\nSen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia have been the party\u2019s most prominent\nskeptics of the reconciliation bill and its price tag.\n\nEllen Schiales, a spokesperson for the climate group, said the organization\nhas worked with the offices of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Sens. Ed\nMarkey (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n(D-N.Y.) to fight for the bill\u2019s most progressive climate provisions.\n\n\u201cEvery [environmental] group has its own priorities but on the whole a lot of\nthese groups have been really unified,\u201d she said, citing specific strong\nsupport for a proposed Civilian Climate Corps that would offer jobs to young\npeople around the country in various environmental projects. They are also\nbacking a version of a clean energy standard without support for natural gas,\nrequiring utilities around the country to steadily ramp up their clean energy\nmix while boxing out fossil fuels \u2014 unless they capture their emissions.\n\nProgressives and environmental groups saw one positive sign last week when two\nHouse Democrats \u2014 Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas and Stephanie Murphy of Florida\n\u2014 indicated that only the climate provisions of the bill should be allowed to\nincrease the deficit, even as they\u2019ve blushed at the package\u2019s overall size.\n\n\u201cAny reconciliation bill must be fiscally responsible and must also take bold\naction to mitigate and adapt to climate change, which will save us money in\nthe long run,\u201d Murphy said in a statement. \u201cIn my view, addressing climate\nchange is both morally necessary and fiscally responsible.\u201d\n\nBut climate activists said they would not go along with any attempt by\nmoderates to strip the non-climate provisions from the $3.5 trillion bill in\nhopes of enhancing its bipartisan appeal. They said progress on climate change\nwould be incomplete without the full sweep of progressive programs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pushing for the full Build Back Better package,\u201d said Tiernan\nSittenfeld, senior vice president of the League of Conservation Voters. \u201cWe\u2019re\nnot negotiating with ourselves.\u201d\n\n  * Filed Under:\n  * [Climate Change](https://www.politico.com/news/climate-change),\n  * [Lobbying](https://www.politico.com/news/lobbying),\n  * [Reconciliation](https://www.politico.com/news/reconciliation),\n  * [Environment](https://www.politico.com/news/environment),\n  * [U.S. Chamber of Commerce](https://www.politico.com/news/us-chamber-of-commerce)\n\n[ POLITICO Politico Logo ](https://www.politico.com/)\n\n  * [ ](http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?pco=tbx32nj-1.0&url=https://politi.co/3E89x0p&pubid=politico.com)\n  * [ ](http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?pco=tbx32nj-1.0&url=https://politi.co/3E89x0p&text=%E2%80%98We+will+have+a+really+long%2C+long+memory%E2%80%99%3A+Greens+calling+businesses%E2%80%99+bluff+on+climate+change&pubid=politico.com&via=politico)\n  *     * Link Copied\n\n  *     * [ ](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fbc48f94c6dd9a968bc0888e99919e988fc6197b63ac9edb8c929797db939a8d9edb9adb899e9a979782db9794959cd7db9794959cdb969e96948982197b62c1dbbc899e9e9588db989a979792959cdb998e8892959e88889e88197b62db99978e9d9ddb9495db989792969a8f9edb98939a959c9edd9a968bc099949f82c6938f8f8b88c1d4d48c8c8cd58b9497928f929894d5989496d4959e8c88d4c9cbc9cad4cbc2d4cac8d49c899e9e9588d68f929c938f9e95d68d92889ed69495d6998e8892959e88889e88d68f94d6999a9890d6989792969a8f9ed699929797d6cecacacecfc2)\n    * [ ](http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://politi.co/3E89x0p&title=%E2%80%98We+will+have+a+really+long%2C+long+memory%E2%80%99%3A+Greens+calling+businesses%E2%80%99+bluff+on+climate+change)\n    * [ ](https://wa.me/?text=https://politi.co/3E89x0p)\n\n  * [About Us](https://www.politico.com/about-us)\n  * [Advertising](https://www.politico.com/advertising)\n  * [Breaking News Alerts](https://www.politico.com/subscribe/breaking-news-alerts)\n  * [Careers](https://www.politico.com/careers)\n  * [Credit Card Payments](https://www.politico.com/payment)\n  * [Digital Edition](http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/Launch.aspx?bypass=true&PBID=74262970-aa07-44b3-80c8-21fa8a8ac376)\n  * [FAQ](https://www.politico.com/faq)\n  * [Feedback](https://www.politico.com/feedback)\n  * [Headlines](https://www.politico.com/politics)\n  * [Photos](https://www.politico.com/gallery)\n  * [POWERJobs](http://www.powerjobs.com/)\n  * [Press](https://www.politico.com/press/about)\n  * [Print Subscriptions](https://www.politico.com/subscriptions)\n  * [Write For Us](https://www.politico.com/write-for-us)\n  * [RSS](https://www.politico.com/rss)\n  * [Site Map](https://www.politico.com/sitemap)\n\n  * [Terms of Service](https://www.politico.com/terms-of-service)\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.politico.com/privacy-policy)\n  * [Do not sell my info](https://www.politico.com/do-not-sell)\n  * [Notice to California Residents](https://www.politico.com/privacy#california)\n\n(C) 2021 POLITICO LLC\n\n"}

2021\n\n[ FrontPageAfrica (Monrovia)  ](http://frontpageafricaonline.com/ \"Visit\nFrontPageAfrica \\(Monrovia\\)\")\n\nBy Lennart Dodoo\n\nMonrovia -- Following two years of intense negotiations, the Government of\nLiberia and the ArcelorMittal have finally agreed to amend the Mineral\nDevelopment Agreement (MDA) of the company to meet with present day realities\nin the country.\n\nThe relevant authorities of the Liberian government and ArcelorMittal will\nsign the latest amendment to the MDA in Monrovia on Friday, September 10,\n2021.\n\nThe signing will bring to three the number of times the MDA amended.\n\nThe 3rd Amendment was required to ensure completion of ArcelorMittal Phase 2\nproject.\n\nA statement issued in Monrovia on Thursday, September 10, 2021 revealed that\nthe Liberian government has secured about US$800 million expansion project to\nbuild a mine concentrate, expand capacity of the Rail and Port from the\ncurrent production of 5 MTPA to 15MTPA within 3 years and a reservation to\nincrease production to 30MTPA over the long term.\n\nIt disclosed that the Liberian government also secured a total $65 million\npayment from ArcelorMittal which includes US$$55million reservation fee for\nfurther of expansion rights for the project to 30MTPA and $10 million signing\nbonus.\n\nThe Government has also secured additional contribution of U$300,000 to\nUS$500,000 annually for projects to be implemented directly by affected\ncommunities in Bong, Grand Bassa, and Nimba.\n\nThe statement added that ArcelorMittal's expansion project will triple iron\nore production in Liberia with a corresponding increase in Government revenue\nand job creation.\n\n\"This US$800 million Phase Two project will result in direct spending into the\nLiberian economy of approximately $200 million per year. The project will\ncreate approximately 1,200 direct employment and 400 indirect employment for\nLiberians. During Construction, there will be approximately 1,500 jobs created\nfor Liberians\".\n\nThe statement maintained that the Amended MDA has also improved the local\ncontent provisions of the agreement to require that within 2 years, AML and\nthe Government to development a framework to ensure Liberian owned SMEs can\nparticipate in the expansion project through the purchase of goods and\nservices from Liberian owned SMEs.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Liberian government will also ensure the\npossibility of a multiuser railroad and port infrastructure to allow Guinean\nMining Companies to access Liberia's transportation infrastructure.\n\nIt disclosed that the Amended MDA also allows for expansion of the Railroad\nand Port to potentially allow an initial 30MTPA of Iron ore from Guinea to\ntransit through Liberia, with Liberia receiving transit fees and greater\nemployment for Liberians.\n\n\"Critically important, the Government has finally secured terms creating a\nframework for multiuse of the existing Rail and Port asset for transport of\nGuinea ore through Liberia. Following difficult discussions, the amended MDA\nnow provides a clear framework in which the Government can enter into access\nagreements with Mining Companies for transport of Iron ore through Liberia\".\n\nQuite recently the Government came under pressure from Afreximbank and Thelo\nDB (research thelo DB) not to sign, saying that the deal may limit the future\nof the multi-user rail framework since AML would be the operator. A visit was\nto Dubai was suggested but this did not materialize because the Government\nresponded that it is on the verge of signing with AML and would be difficult\nto open new discussions. Government's response was that that discussion with\nThelo DB proposal was on a new rail from Guinea, not on the current rail. The\nGovernment remains open to a discussion on new rail. With the change of\nGovernment in Guinea, discussions on exporting Guinean ore through Liberia may\ntake on new momentum.\n\n__ Close\n\n![](https://cdn07.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-\ntext-128x128.png)\n\n#### Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters\n\nGet the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\n\nTop HeadlinesLiberiaMining\n\nSubmit\n\nBy submitting above, you agree to [our privacy\npolicy](/misc/info/privacy.html).\n\n####  __Success!\n\nAlmost finished...\n\nWe need to confirm your email address.\n\nTo complete the process, please follow the instructions in the email we just\nsent you.\n\n####  __Error!\n\n####  __Error!\n\nThere was a problem processing your submission.

The ore is then transported by rail on the 243\nkilometer railway to the Port of Buchanan, where the ore is loaded onto ships\nfor transportation around the world.\n\nThe first shipment of Direct Shipping Ore (DSO) left Liberian shores in\nSeptember 2011.\n\nThe company has immensely contributed to improving the living conditions of\ncitizens and carrying out multiple infrastructural developments since its\noperations were launched in Liberia in 2005.\n\n_Read the[ **original article**](https://frontpageafricaonline.com/front-\nslider/liberia-govt-arcelormittal-sign-groundbreaking-amended-mineral-\ndevelopment-agreement-today/) on\n[**FrontPageAfrica**](http://frontpageafricaonline.com/ \"Visit\nFrontPageAfrica\")._\n\nTagged:\n\n  * [Liberia](/liberia/)\n  * [West Africa](/westafrica/)\n  * [Business](/business/)\n  * [Mining](/mining/)\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[Copyright](https://allafrica.com/misc/info/copyright.html) (C) 2021\n[FrontPageAfrica](http://frontpageafricaonline.com/).

High-grade gold mineralization was\nintercepted up to 450 meters from the current Valley of the Kings resource\nshell and up to 300 meters from the West Zone resource shell. (See Table 1\nbelow for assays.)\n\nOne drill hole from each drill fan was extended to test the exploration\npotential to the north of the North Block Zone. These extended holes\nintersected stockwork veining and high-grade gold mineralization along trend\nfrom the West Zone. An intersection from drill hole VU-3252 assayed 3,660.0\ngrams per tonne gold over 1.0 meter at 330.5 meters down hole.\n\n\u201cThese new drill results from the North Block zone increase our confidence in\nthe continuity of high-grade gold mineralization to the north of the Valley of\nthe Kings deposit. An updated Mineral Resource estimate is expected to be\nreleased in the first half of next year and it will include the North Block\nzone,\u201d said Jacques Perron, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pretivm.\n\u201cPhase 4 of the North Block drilling program is currently underway to test the\npotential to the west of the first three phases of drilling.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe North Block Zone is located directly to the north of the Valley of the\nKings deposit. The resource expansion exploration program is designed to test\nfor Valley of the Kings-style mineralization to the north and at depth. Phase\n3 of the program was drilled from the 1150 and 1070 Levels in the mine,\ntargeting an area extending up to 450 meters north of the current Valley of\nthe Kings resource shell.\n\n _North Block \u2013 Phase 3 Results_\n\nPhase 3 of the North Block resource expansion program comprised 25,154 meters\nin 85 drill holes. Drilling from the 1150 Level intersected the extension of\nthe Domain 13 Stockwork, which is currently being mined in the Valley of the\nKings. Drilling from the 1070 Level intersected the recently identified\ncorridor of gold mineralization in the footwall of the Domain 13 structure,\nfeaturing coarse electrum in northwest oriented quartz-carbonate veins within\na broader halo of lower grade gold mineralization.\n\nFor a plan and section view of the 2021 North Block Phase 3 program please see\nthe following

On paper, Ellen\nwould be an asset anywhere. A former Royal Navy officer, who had launched and\nrun her own successful designer handbag company, she even had a master\u2019s\ndegree in staff administration.\n\nYet the bullying began, she claims, after just a week in the job. Her\ncolleagues joked about the fan she put on her desk to keep herself cool.

The note named her and, Ellen believes, had been deliberately\nput there by her boss.\n\nThe insult cut deep.

The first six months of 2021 saw ten such cases \u2014 and\nthe number is expected to go on rising.\n\nEmployment lawyers say women are increasingly feeling empowered to challenge\nemployers who ignore or fail to understand the devastating impact of the\ncondition on their female workforce.\n\nWomen aged 50 to 64 are today the fastest growing economically-active group in\nBritain (later state pension ages and longer life expectancy means we\u2019re all\nhaving to work longer), yet recent research found we could be losing 14\nmillion work days a year as a consequence of menopause problems.\n\nFor a significant number, it goes further even than missed days. A shocking\none in four women who experience symptoms consider leaving their job\naltogether \u2014 and many do go on to quit \u2014 resulting in a huge loss of\nknowledge, experience and talent.\n\n![Deborah Garlick, 56 \\(pictured\\) gave up her high-powered job at Boots 11\nyears ago when menopausal symptoms left her struggling to\ncope](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n![Deborah Garlick, 56 \\(pictured\\) gave up her high-powered job at Boots 11\nyears ago when menopausal symptoms left her struggling to\ncope](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/12/20/47824661-9983109-image-a-3_1631474430598.jpg)\n\nDeborah Garlick, 56 (pictured) gave up her high-powered job at Boots 11 years\nago when menopausal symptoms left her struggling to cope\n\nTake the alarming case of 56-year-old Sarah Janner, a married mother of one\nfrom Lincolnshire who was fired from her job after 19 years and fought back at\nan employment tribunal last September.\n\nShe was sacked for gross misconduct by a housing association where she was a\nwelfare officer. The reason? Her bosses accused her of getting behind in her\nwork, filing reports late, not turning up on time, and going to unauthorised\nmedical appointments.\n\nWhen Sarah challenged her dismissal at a tribunal, she stood in front of a\nmale, middle-aged judge, and told him her menopause symptoms had suddenly made\nit hard to stay on top of things. \u2018I laid it on the line to him,\u2019 she says\ntoday. \u2018I said I had been suffering from constant hot flushes, fatigue, brain\nfog, heavy periods lasting for days, heart palpitations and exhaustion.\n\n\u2018I had lost over two stone in weight and, at just over eight stone, my clothes\nwere falling off me. I had a lack of confidence because I didn\u2019t know what my\nmenopausal body was going to throw at me next.\n\n\u2018I was going home after work and was putting myself to bed at 7.30 in the\nevening fully clothed because I was so exhausted. It was half an hour before\nthe bedtime of my ten-year-old daughter who would have to be looked after by\nmy husband.\u2019\n\nTo Sarah\u2019s dismay, the judge took little notice. He took less than a day to\nthrow her case out. She says he treated her as though she had had a \u2018touch of\nthe vapours\u2019 or was an over-hysterical woman \u2018making it up\u2019.\n\n![Solicitor Adam Pavey said it is not uncommon for women to leave employment\nat mid-life, or to be wrongly dismissed because of \u2018poor performance\u2019 \\(file\nimage\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n![Solicitor Adam Pavey said it is not uncommon for women to leave employment\nat mid-life, or to be wrongly dismissed because of \u2018poor performance\u2019 \\(file\nimage\\)](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/12/20/47825003-9983109-image-a-9_1631475148608.jpg)\n\nSolicitor Adam Pavey said it is not uncommon for women to leave employment at\nmid-life, or to be wrongly dismissed because of \u2018poor performance\u2019 (file\nimage)\n\nShe adds: \u2018I think he thought it was sour grapes on my part because I had been\nsacked. He kept asking, in a mystified way, why I felt I had been let down at\nwork when I was an intelligent person. He seemed to think if I couldn\u2019t do my\njob properly, I deserved to lose it.\u2019\n\nSarah \u2014 whose name we have changed \u2014 was suddenly without a career and has not\nworked since. She is embarrassed to tell some family and friends that it was\nthe menopause which cost her the job she loved.\n\n\u2018I just say, I gave it up because I\u2019d had enough,\u2019 she explains now.\n\nSarah had been to the doctor about her symptoms, but the GP said: \u2018It is just\npart of being a woman, things begin to slow down when you get older.\u2019 She told\nhim that with years of her active life ahead, she didn\u2019t want to slow down.\nHRT was not discussed.\n\n\u2018Lots of women are going through the same as me,\u2019 she adds today. \u2018They could\nbe your wife, sister, mother or daughter.\u2019\n\nHer solicitor Adam Pavey, a leading employment lawyer at Pannone Solicitors,\nagrees: \u2018There are lots of Sarahs out there who hit the menopause and then\nunwillingly lose, or choose to leave their jobs. It is not uncommon for women\nto leave employment at mid-life, or to be wrongly dismissed because of \u2018poor\nperformance\u2019.\n\n\u2018The organisation Sarah worked for didn\u2019t understand the menopause.

Adam thinks this is wrong: although it doesn\u2019t affect\nall women in such a way as to impact on their ability to work, when so many\nwomen do suffer such wide-ranging effects, the menopause should surely come\nunder sex discrimination law.\n\nMPs are looking into it. Last month a parliamentary inquiry was launched into\nthe workplace treatment of menopausal women, to examine if current sex\nequality laws go far enough.\n\nIndeed, the House of Commons\u2019 Women and Equalities Committee says one million\nUK women, many in their late 40s and early 50s and at the peak of their\ncareers, have left their jobs because of the menopause.\n\n\u2018Three in five women are negatively affected at work as a result of this,\u2019\nsays committee chair Caroline Nokes MP. \u2018Excluding menopausal women from the\nworkplace is detrimental to our economy, our society, and our place on the\nworld stage.\n\n\u2018Despite the fact that hundreds of thousands of UK women are currently going\nthrough this process, which can be both physically and mentally draining, it\nis ignored in law.\n\n\u2018This huge issue has been left near-invisible for far too long.\u2019\n\n![Deborah \\(pictured\\) has collaborated with\u00a0Government ministers to set up an\naccreditation programme to help employers with training and education about\nmenopause](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n![Deborah \\(pictured\\) has collaborated with\u00a0Government ministers to set up an\naccreditation programme to help employers with training and education about\nmenopause](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/12/20/47824665-9983109-image-m-5_1631474741100.jpg)\n\nDeborah (pictured) has collaborated with Government ministers to set up an\naccreditation programme to help employers with training and education about\nmenopause\n\nSeveral high-profile women have begun to speak out, however. TV presenter and\nmenopause campaigner Davina McCall credits HRT for saving her career.\n\n\u2018I definitely would not have been able to continue working had I not gone on\nHRT,\u2019 she\u2019s said. \u2018Women are on the verge of losing their jobs or leaving\ntheir jobs because they can\u2019t cope with it. I would love to encourage any big\nbusiness to have a menopause nurse on hand because that\u2019s what women seem\nabsolutely desperate for.\u2019\n\nSome businesses are already acting. Last month it was announced that HSBC,\nFirst Direct and M&S Bank had signed up to a new \u2018Menopause Friendly\nAccreditation\u2019 which recognises companies willing to build awareness around\nthe menopause.\n\nThe programme is the brain child of Deborah Garlick, 56, who gave up her high-\npowered job at Boots 11 years ago when menopausal symptoms left her struggling\nto cope.\n\n\u2018I loved my job, but every day was a battle and I had no idea what was\nhappening to me. Menopause was such a taboo subject back then, I felt I had to\nleave before I damaged my reputation.\u2019\n\nShe set up an online community for midlife women called Henpicked, and\ncollaborated with Government ministers to set up an accreditation programme to\nhelp employers with training and education about menopause.\n\n![Lawyer Adam Pavey says far fewer grievance cases would come to court if\nemployers were more sympathetic about the menopause \\(file\nimage\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n![Lawyer Adam Pavey says far fewer grievance cases would come to court if\nemployers were more sympathetic about the menopause \\(file\nimage\\)](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/12/20/47824947-9983109-image-a-8_1631475054701.jpg)\n\nLawyer Adam Pavey says far fewer grievance cases would come to court if\nemployers were more sympathetic about the menopause (file image)\n\n\u2018It is all about encouraging an environment where employees can talk openly\nabout menopause, without fear of being stigmatised. The aim is to make\nmenopause a normal subject \u2014 just like pregnancy \u2014 which you can openly\ndiscuss with your manager or HR department.\u2019\n\nDeborah\u2019s team set up Menopause In The Workplace and they have now worked with\n2,000 businesses, many of which have established \u2018menopause champions\u2019 to\nraise awareness.\n\nClearly, if someone isn\u2019t doing their job properly, employers can\u2019t turn a\nblind eye. But Deborah\u2019s work shows how a sympathetic ear and understanding\nthe impact menopause can have at work, can go a long way to solving problems.\n\nLawyer Adam Pavey says far fewer grievance cases would come to court if\nemployers were more sympathetic about the menopause, and had the knowledge and\nresources to step in before things spiralled out of control.\n\nSarah agrees that for her, a supportive line of communication could have saved\nher job. \u2018I\u2019d had an unblemished service record for more than 18 years, yet\nwhen I asked for help I was treated so badly it only exacerbated my stress\nlevels. I wasn\u2019t expecting any special treatment, or special allowances \u2014 just\na little bit of understanding and support,\u2019 she says.\n\nThere is hope the lifting of taboos and a growing understanding of the complex\nnature of menopause symptoms will encourage more employers to seek training\nand guidance.\n\n![Business analyst Tracy Wills, 53, said people assumed she was drunk when she\nhad brain fog' during a conference \\(file\nimage\\)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n![Business analyst Tracy Wills, 53, said people assumed she was drunk when she\nhad brain fog' during a conference \\(file\nimage\\)](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/09/12/20/47824953-9983109-image-a-6_1631475014964.jpg)\n\nBusiness analyst Tracy Wills, 53, said people assumed she was drunk when she\nhad brain fog' during a conference (file image)\n\nIt\u2019s a sea change that business analyst Tracy Wills, 53, wholeheartedly\nwelcomes. She said of her horrifying experience of being in a conference with\neight senior colleagues when menopausal \u2018brain fog\u2019 set in. She was meant to\nbe introducing everybody. \u2018I got to one man I worked with every day and\ncouldn\u2019t remember his name. Then I forgot the names of two others.\u2019\n\nAdd to this her sudden misplacing of passwords and clumsiness. \u2018People kept\nasking if I was drunk,\u2019 she adds. But when she tried to explain it all to her\nline manager, he looked at her as if she was \u2018an alien\u2019.\n\n\u2018My confidence was so low. I was exhausted. I didn\u2019t have the energy to keep\nmy \u201cgame face\u201d on.\u2019\n\nQuitting her job at 49, she took a year-long \u2018menopause break\u2019 before looking\nfor a new company, eventually discovering a pioneering finance company, which\nhad a menopause policy in line with the Menopause In The Workplace directives.\n\n\u2018I was very open about the fact my career break had been due to menopause\nsymptoms and the woman who hired me said I was being offered the job on the\nstrength of those experiences,\u2019 she said.\n\nPrecisely the sort of enlightened attitude, say a growing band of menopause-\nat-work campaigners, from which many other companies could learn.\n\n### Share or comment on this article:\n\n# Why the menopause is having its DAY IN COURT\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   * [ e-mail ](mailto:?subject=Read this: Why the menopause is having its DAY IN COURT:\u00a0They've been bullied for hot flushes, sidelined by exhaustion or felt compelled to leave their jobs due to brain fog.

yet another sign the Television Academy may need to seriously reconsider\nsome of its categories, **Claire Foy** won her second Emmy Award for playing\n**Queen Elizabeth II** in **\" The Crown.\"** This win, however, came in the\nGuest Actress in a Drama Series category and for a less than 5 minute\nappearance in the fifth season of the series. A season in which another Emmy\nnominee from the series, **Olivia Colman** , will likely lose her Lead Actress\ncategory for playing the same character (although a few decades older).

coworking space.\n>\n> Design, space design and project implementation were entrusted to the design\n> studio ZIKZAK, whose experienced and creative specialists brilliantly\n> brought 860 square meters into reality.\n>\n> Company specialists ZIKZAK managed to combine modern technologies,\n> fashionable architectural trends and nature in design. This approach made it\n> possible to create a truly versatile space that can be used for both work\n> and leisure.\n>\n> The deep work area with sound-absorbing panels allows for active discussions\n> without interfering with the work or play of other employees and guests.\n> Also, visitors and employees of the space can safely hold negotiations or a\n> ZOOM conference in a small phone booth.\n>\n> The location itself is divided into several zones:\n>\n>   * reception area\n>   * area of work of assistants\n>   * Lounge zone with collaboration area\n>   * multifunctional cabinet for confidential meetings and meetings with VIP\n> partners\n>   * meeting room-transformer\n>   * deep work area\n>   * food zone\n>   * terrace overlooking the Dnieper and the left bank of Kyiv\n>\n\n>\n> A cozy terrace with tables and soft sofas is perfect for relaxing after\n> productive work and holding corporate events.\n>\n> The space is located in the heart of the capital, in the Summit business\n> center, which overlooks the Dnieper. It was the location of the building\n> that inspired the Parimatch brand and ZIKZAK specialists to create a new\n> space.\n\n**Design** : [ZIKZAK architects](https://zikzak.com.ua/)  \n**Design Team** : Karnaukhova Alesya, Tivanenko Maria, Tsimbal Lilia, Ksenya\nMikhailenko, Anastasia Trofimenko, Yuri Karakozov, Oksana Petrovskaya, Igor\nYashin, Oksana Gorbach  \n**Photography** : [Andrey Avdeenko](http://www.avdeenko.com.ua/index_en.html)\n\n25 Images | expand for additional detail\n\n[![Parimatch Tech Offices -

'We don\u2019t know what got into him', says the family of a security officer who\nkilled 6 in a shooting spree\n\nBy Sakhiseni Nxumalo ![Time of article published](/static/media/clock-\nico.76e49fb3.svg) 5h ago\n\nShare this article:\n\nShareTweetShareShareShareEmailShare\n\nDURBAN \u2013 A FAMILY who lost four relatives, including three young children,\nwhen a security officer allegedly opened fire at their Bruntville home in Mooi\nRiver at the weekend, say they have a lot of questions about what could have\nled to the shooting.\n\nA security officer from Mooi River went on a shooting spree and allegedly\nkilled six people, including his 5-yearold son, in two different towns.\n\nAccording to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid), the\nincident took place on Saturday when the 26-year-old suspect first shot his\n40-year-old colleague at New Formosa in Estcourt.\n\nIt was alleged that the victim was shot in the head and his body was dumped in\nthe veld.\n\nIpid spokesperson Grace Langa said it was alleged that the suspect was with\nhis colleague in a company vehicle when he shot him.\n\n## MORE ON

River where he also allegedly\nshot dead another security officer, aged 42, whom he suspected of being in a\nrelationship with his ex-girlfriend.\n\nShe alleged that the suspect then drove to Bruntville where he shot dead his\n34-year-old ex-girlfriend\u2019s sister and three children.\n\n\u201cHe shot his own 5-year-old son, a 34-year-old female relative and her 5-year-\nold son, and a 13-year-old relative in Mooi River. It is further alleged that\nthe suspect then fled the scene and proceeded to his ex-girlfriend\u2019s place of\nemployment on Alexandra Terrace. On arrival, the suspect fired several shots\nat the woman and ran away,\u201d added Langa.\n\nLanga stated that the 25-year-old victim was critically injured and was\ntransported to a hospital where she remained in a critical condition.\n\nThe suspect then drove to his homestead in Matimatolo, Greytown, Langa said.\n\nLanga said the suspect was intercepted by police and a shoot-out occurred and\nthe man died.\n\n\u201cIpid is investigating his death and a post-mortem will be conducted and more\nstatements will be collected.\u201d\n\nKZN provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker also confirmed the\nincident and said police were investigating six counts of murder and one count\nof attempted murder.\n\nA relative of the deceased, who asked not to be named, said the family were\nall sitting in their home when the suspect entered the house.\n\nThe relative said the incident had left them with a lot of questions that no\none could answer at this stage.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what got into him. For now, we are just hoping and hoping that\nthe person in the hospital will get better soon so that she can at least brief\nus about what happened.\n\n\u201cThe sad part is that when she wakes up, she will have to face the depressing\nnews that her son has passed away. So this is just too much for everyone and\nthe situation is still tense at the moment,\u201d she said.\n\nKwaZulu-Natal Social Development spokesperson Mhlabunzima Memela said that it\nwas shocking that after so many campaigns that the government had embarked on\nto bring awareness and call for an end to gender-based violence, such brutal\nincidents were still happening.\n\nHe said there were several options available to people to deal with their\nproblems.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that every time we talk about people getting murdered, we\nalways speak about women and children,\u201d said Memela.\n\nMemela added that the department would assign social workers to assist the\nbereaved families through this difficult time.\n\n **THE MERCURY**\n\n[SAPS](/tags/saps)[Crime and

Given the sell-out\npopularity of the Florida event, it seemed inevitable that the Disneyland\nResort would eventually follow suit, but they never did.\n\nAfter the company rebooted the Halloween event in 2010, we were sure a\nChristmas version would follow within a year or two, but... crickets.\n\nUntil now.\n\n[![](https://www.mouseplanet.info/gallery/d/345356-2/Holidays-30-Disney.jpg)](https://www.mouseplanet.info/gallery/d/345352-1/Holidays-30-Disney.jpg\n\"Disneyland will debut a new Merriest Nites event in November. Photo courtesy\nDisney. \")  \nDisneyland will debut a new Merriest Nites event in November. Photo courtesy\nDisney.\n\nLast week, and seemingly out of the blue, the [Disney Parks\nBlog](https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/09/celebrate-the-holiday-\nseason-in-a-merry-new-way-with-disney-merriest-nites-an-all-new-after-hours-\nevent-at-disneyland-park/) announced Disney's Merriest Nites at Disneyland, a\nseries of five after-hours parties in November and December.\n\nDisney describes the event as being \"6 holiday parties in one,\" with six\nthemed areas inside the park, each with a Disney character host.\n\n> **Victorian-Themed Party on Main Street, U.S.A**. -  The host with the most,\n> Mickey Mouse, invites you to the party of the year! Revel in the holiday\n> spirit with marvelous snow moments and holly-jolly carolers singing some\n> holiday favorites.\n>\n> **Feliz Navidad Party in Frontierland** -  Join Miguel from  _Coco_  for a\n> jolly fiesta with lively music, dancing and so much more.\n>\n> **New Orleans Holiday in New Orleans Square** -  Swing by this jazzy\n> celebration hosted by Tiana and brimming with beads, beignets and bountiful\n> holiday fun.\n>\n> _**Frozen**_ **-Themed Party in Fantasyland** - Discover a flurry of\n> festivities at a celebration featuring Elsa and her icy escapades--and\n> plenty of heartwarming cheer.\n>\n> **Tropical Party in Adventureland** -  Delight in a holiday celebration with\n> tropical flair hosted by the lovable Lilo and her mischievous pal, Stitch.\n>\n> **Tomorrowland Party in Tomorrowland** -  Party to infinity and beyond at\n> this futuristic hoopla featuring Buzz Lightyear, a DJ and more.\n\nThe event will also include a performance of A Christmas Fantasy Parade,\nspecial photo opportunities, event-exclusive merchandise and food offerings,\nand appearances by Disney characters in their holiday finery.\n\nThe Disney Parks Blog article also promised a special appearance by the\nMuppets on Main Street, with \"Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and their friends\njoin in the fun, traveling in a special coach with Christmas carol sing-\nalongs.\"\n\nIt does not appear that the holiday fireworks are part of this offering,\nthough Disney does promise there will be \"snow moments\" on Main Street.\n\nMost attractions in the lands listed above will remain open, but Disney\nspecifically notes that Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, Mickey's Toontown and\nCritter Country will be closed during the event.\n\nThe events each run 8:00 p.m. to midnight, with theme park access available\nstarting at 5:00 p.m. each night for event guests. Event dates and prices are\nlisted below. One reader noted via Twitter, \"'School nights only, late nights,\nhigh price tag. [I don't know] who the target audience is but it sure isn't\nfamilies with school age kids.\"\n\n**Dates and Times** | **Ticket Price**  \n---|---  \nThursday, November 11 | $175  \nTuesday, November 16 | $165  \nTuesday, November 30 | $165  \nTuesday, December 7 | $165  \nThursday, December 9 | $165  \n  \nTickets go on sale via the [Disneyland\nwebsite](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/events-tours/disneyland/merriest-\nnites/) no earlier than 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, September 14.\n\nWith the Disneyland Resort now back in the after-hours event business, we're\nhoping for news about the Villains Nite and Star Wars Nite events, which had\nto be postponed due to the theme park closures in 2020. Visitors who had\nalready purchased tickets to either (or both) of the sold-out events will\nautomatically receive a ticket for the rescheduled event(s) once they are\nrescheduled. However, anyone who purchased a ticket and prefers a refund can\ncall (714) 781-4636 to request one.\n\n#### Mobile food ordering expands to new locations\n\nLast month Disney introduced mobile ordering at three candy shops, and now a\nfourth location has been added to the list, making it even easier to pick up a\nsweet treat during your visit.\n\nInside Disneyland park, you can now order candy apples, chocolate-covered\nmarshmallows and crispy rice treats from the Hunny Spot at Pooh's Corner, in\naddition to the Main Street Candy Palace and Kitchen.\n\nTrolley Treats in Disney California Adventure also accepts mobile orders,\nincluding during the after-hours Oogie Boogie Bash. You can also grab a snack\non your way back to your Disneyland hotel room by visiting Marceline's\nConfectionery in Downtown Disney.\n\nAll four of these locations offer seasonal treats, so you can get your bat\ncookies, mummy marshmallow wands and Jack Skellington cake pops without\nwaiting in line.\n\n#### Tickets available for Breakfast with Santa at Catal\n\nReservations are now open for the 2021 Breakfast with Santa events at Catal\nrestaurant in Downtown Disney. Catal has extended the popular event this year,\nand will host the breakfast on eleven dates between November 27 and December\n24.\n\nThe event includes family-style breakfast at Catal restaurant in Downtown\nDisney, live entertainment, a photo opportunity with Santa Claus, and a\npersonalized stocking and stuffed animal for each child.\n\nBrunch is served between 8:00 a.m. and 12:45. Tickets are $109.95 per adult\nand $49.95 per child ages 3 to 10. Children 2 and under are free, but must be\ncounted in the party size. Registration is now open--book online via the\n[Patina Group website](https://patina.social/catal-restaurant-breakfast-with-\nsanta/).\n\n#### Gay Days returns to Disneyland this weekend\n\nThe 2021 Gay Days at Disneyland is scheduled for this Friday through Sunday,\nSeptember 17-19\\. The event welcome center is located in the Trillium Room in\nDisney's Grand Californian Hotel, and a number of the weekend events will be\nheld in the hotel's conference center.\n\nYou can [view the full schedule](https://www.gaydaysanaheiminfo.com/schedule)\nof organized activities and meet-ups on the [event\nwebsite](http://www.gaydaysanaheim.com/ \" \\[external link to\nwww.gaydaysanaheim.com\\]\"). Most in-park gatherings are planned to take place\non Saturday inside Disneyland park, and on Sunday inside Disney California\nAdventure.

If you know of any in-park\nevents, official or unofficial, that should be listed here, please send us an\n[e-mail](mailto:parkupdates@mouseplanet.com?subject=Resort%20Updates).\n\n#### New! Just click the year you want to expand (or close).\n\n##### 2021-2022\n\n  * **Halloween Time** - September 3 through October 31.\n  * **Oogie Boogie Bash** at Disney California Adventure - select nights September 9 to October 31. The event is now sold out.\n  * **Gay Days (unofficial event)** - September 17-19\\. More information on the [event website](https://www.gaydaysanaheiminfo.com/).\n  * **Dapper Day (unofficial event)** - Fall Outing to Disneyland scheduled for November 13-14. More information on the [event website](http://dapperday.com/).\n  * **2022 D23 Expo** - September 9-11, 2022 at the Anaheim Convention Center.\n  * **Disney's Merriest Nights at Disneyland** -  select nights November 11 - December 9. Tickets go on sale September 14. More information on the [event website](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/events-tours/disneyland/merriest-nites/#drawer-card-ticket-dates).\n\nPostponed events:\n\n  * Disneyland After Dark: Villains Nite - postponed from Thursday, April 30, 2020. Visitors who had already purchased a ticket to the sold-out event will automatically receive a ticket for the rescheduled event once a date is selected. However, anyone who purchased a ticket and prefers a refund can call (714) 781-4636 to request one.\n  * Disneyland After Dark: Star Wars Nite - postponed from Thursday, August 27, 2020. Visitors who had already purchased a ticket to the sold-out event will automatically receive a ticket for the rescheduled event once a date is selected. However, anyone who purchased a ticket and prefers a refund can call (714) 781-4636 to request one.\n\nWe also recommend checking the convention calendar at the Anaheim/Orange\nCounty Visitor and Convention Bureau\n[website](http://meetings.anaheimoc.org/convention-calendar). When looking at\nthat site, remember to note both the number of people and the number of rooms\nresulting from each convention. A gathering of 25,000 people booking few room\nnights (indicating most will be driving in to the area for their meeting) can\nimpact traffic around the resort much more than a crowd of 25,000 staying in\narea hotels. Of course, that second group is going to make finding a hotel\nroom more difficult (and possibly more expensive), so it's best to book your\nown room as early as possible if you see that a big convention is in town\nduring your trip.\n\n### Non-Disney Resort Events\n\nNotable events at parks and attractions around Southern California. If you\nknow of an event that should be listed here, please send us an\n[e-mail](mailto:parkupdates@mouseplanet.com?subject=Non-\nDisney%20Resort%20Events).\n\n* * *\n\n### Current Discounts and Promotions\n\nDisneyland prices as of February 2020.\n\nNote: MousePlanet does not edit past Updates to reflect price increases; for\nup-to-date prices, check the most recent Disneyland Resort Update. Several\ncurrent promotions offer discounted admission to the Disneyland Resort. For\nyour convenience, we have grouped the discount offers based on the number of\ndays the tickets are valid. Check out the category that best matches the\namount of time you plan to spend at the resort, and pick the offer that works\nbest for you. And keep those tips coming--let us know if you find a better or\ndifferent offer, so we can share it with other readers!\n\nThis first section is a list of discounts on ticket-only purchases. Though it\nhas become more common in recent years, Disneyland tickets are rarely offered\nat deep discounts unless you are a resident of Southern California or Northern\nMexico. For residents outside that area, the best discounts available tend to\nbe simple advance purchase discounts. If you know of any additional discounts,\noffers, promotions, or contests that should be listed in this section, [drop\nus a line](http://www.mouseplanet.com/contact/w/16/Adrienne-Vincent-Phoenix).\nNote, we are no longer listing offers from the Anaheim-Orange County Visitor &\nConvention Bureau, as their convenience fee negates any savings.\n\nDon't get scammed! Never buy tickets from an unofficial or secondary outlet,\nsuch as through eBay or Craigslist. Never rent or purchase tickets from people\napproaching you outside the gates stating they have remaining days or leftover\ntickets. This practice is against the terms of use for Disneyland admission,\nand may result in denial of entry. It is also common for criminals to shoplift\ninactivated Disney theme park tickets from supermarkets to resell them. There\nis no way to determine if these tickets are valid until you try to use them to\nenter the parks. Only purchase Disney theme park tickets directly from Disney,\nan authorized seller, or travel agency like MousePlanet travel partner [Get\nAway\nToday](https://www.getawaytoday.com/tickets/disneylandresortarea?referrerid=5761).\n\n[![Get Away Today\nLogo](https://www.mouseplanet.info/gallery/d/285821-2/GAT+Logo+New.jpg)](https://www.getawaytoday.com/tickets/orlandotickets?referrerid=5761)\n\n### Ticket Prices and Promotions\n\n#### New!

Some travel providers\nmay offer tickets for 6 days or longer as part of a package to international\ncustomers; residents of Canada, Australia, or the U.K. should check with local\ntravel agencies to see what options may be available.\n\nIf you purchased a promotional Canada Resident Ticket or Australia/New Zealand\nResident Ticket, and have not used it, the expiration date will be extended\nthrough December 16, 2021, and the ticket will expire 13 days after first use\nor December 16, 2021, whichever occurs first.

A new\nmembership program is expected to launch in late 2020.\n\nPassholders who held a valid Disneyland Resort annual passport as of March 14,\n2020 are considered Legacy Passholders, and continue to receive certain\nbenefits. Check the discounts section below.\n\nCheck with your employer, school or credit union to see if any other discounts\nare available through them.\n\n\n\n### Additional Discounts\n\nDid we miss an offer? If you know of an authorized discount on Disneyland\nResort tickets, standing offers for Annual Passholders from non-Disney\nvendors, or other promotions which might interest our readers, please drop us\na note!\n\n#### New! Just click the category you want to expand (or close).\n\n##### Everyone\n\nPurchase with purchase offers - Disneyland Resort shops frequently offer a\nreduced-price souvenir (often a tote bag, watch, or blanket) with a qualifying\nminimum purchase. These are offered at Disney-operated stores only, and\nselection may vary by location.\n\nDisney usually allows customers to purchase more than one of the offers in a\nqualifying transaction, so if you spend $40 or more you can buy both items\ncurrently available if you wish. If you're a passholder, the minimum purchase\nis calculated after your discount, and your discount does not apply to the\npromotional item.\n\n##### Legacy Annual Passholders\n\nAfter ended the former annual passholder program and creating the Legacy\nPassholder designation earlier this year, the Disneyland Resort said it would\ncontinue some passholder benefits for Legacy Passholders, including\nmerchandise and food & beverage discounts at participating shops, until a new\nprogram is announced. At press time, the discount has been extended through\nMay 31, 2020, but we expect that will be extended even further.\n\nLegacy Passholders must show a digital discount ticket on their Disneyland app\n_along with their physical passport and valid photo ID_ to receive any\napplicable food or merchandise benefits, or to access passholder-only\nopportunities.\n\nDisney will automatically uploaded this digital discount ticket to the\naccounts of passholders who had previously linked their ticket to their\nDisneyland app. Passholders who had not previously linked their ticket to the\nDisneyland app must now do so, using a ticket code that was sent to them via\nemail in March.\n\nIf you had already linked your ticket but the digital discount ticket does not\nappear on your account, contact Passholder Member Services at (714) 781-4567\nor use the chat feature in the Disneyland app for assistance.\n\nVisit the [Legacy Annual Passholder discount\npage](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/passes/discounts/shops/) for specific\ndetails and exclusions.\n\n##### Disney Rewards VISA Credit Card Holders\n\nSee the [Disney Visa website](https://disneyrewards.com/) for terms and\nconditions for all of these promotions.\n\nDisney Magic Shot at Disney California Adventure - cardholders have access to\na private photo opportunity at Disney California Adventure, where a Disney\ncharacter will be digitally added to your photo.

My boyfriend and I are planning for the 12/9 event. We are most\nexcited about the Victorian Christmas on Main Street and the fiesta de Navidad\nin Frontierland.  \n  \nWe first saw the Christmas Fantasy Parade in 2004... we think it\ufffds time for an\nupdate!\n\n  2. **[Discuss this article on MousePad.](https://mousepad.mouseplanet.com/showthread.php?t=310875)** \n\n## About MousePlanet\n\nMousePlanet is your independent consumer guide to Disney travel and vacations,\ncovering Disneyland, Walt Disney World and the Disney Cruise Line.
