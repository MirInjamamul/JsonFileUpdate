Just not the one you think.It doesn't involve billionaires pioneering next-frontier tourism; rather, it\u2019s a furious scramble of established players and startups looking to push the boundaries of \u201cspace logistics.\u201dPlanting a flag in the past 18 months: Northrop Grumman  NOC , first to launch a \u201csatellite life extension craft,\u201d its Mission Extension Vehicle (MEV-1). In late February 2020, MEV-1 successfully performed an automated rendezvous with a non-transmitting satellite, Intelsat  I 901, in need of an in-orbit service check and a fuel-up \u2013 something never done before. This past spring, MEV-2 successfully docked to a telecommunications satellite (the Intelsat 10-02) still transmitting but running out of propellant. Additionally, Northrop Grumman has begun work on remote-controlled space garbage clean-up vehicles.Meanwhile, engineers at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., are working on the launch of OSAM-1, an unmanned craft, equipped with a robotic arm, able to reach and rehabilitate aging government satellites. Its inaugural mission is three years away. Pasadena-based Motiv Space Systems, which furnished NASA with the seven-foot-long, five-degrees-of-freedom-equipped robotic arm utilized by the Mars Rover, has custom built a brand new modular robotic arm system, xLink.Mixing and matching arms by size, weight and specialty, the system can do in-orbit assembly of the components (e.g. a boom, an antenna) needed to fix a satellite \u2013 without any human astronauts.Automated satellite repair, orbital tow trucking, interstellar fueling stations, space junk removal \u2013 the sky, as it turns out, is not the limit \u2013 as all of these out-of-this-world supply chain sub-niches are being developed as fast as any science-fiction writer could imagine them. Some MIT professors are even forecasting space warehouses that\u2019ll house raw materials and parts to be used for ever-more ambitious space stations, eventually moon bases, spawning a multitude of possibilities in terms of payloads and missions.MORE FOR YOU### With The #1 Farm Tractor In The World, Mahindra Looks To Supercharge Its U.S. Business### How An Under 30 Alum Decided To Shutter Her Bike Helmet Startup To Focus On Her Own Mental Health### Has Origin Materials Cracked The Code On Carbon-Negative Plant-Based Plastics?Still nascent, but quickly gaining speed and altitude, the space logistics realm is being led by a competitive, at times collaborative, community of scientists, engineers, agencies, as well as an array of aerospace and robotics companies.In the past 12 months, the U.S. space economy has been injected with an estimated $9 billion, much of it from wealthy, well-known entrepreneurs but also a sizable portion flowing from venture capital funds and crowd-funding platforms, according to Tim Chrisman, executive director of the Foundation for the Future, the trade association for the burgeoning space finance industry.The total size of what the organization defines as the commercial space sector is, in terms of revenue, estimated to be roughly $200 billion. Potentially, the sector could double to $400 billion by 2030, assuming modest growth and supportive policies, according to Chrisman.It's not just a matter of greater federal appropriations, Chrisman said, emphasizing an industry proposal to create a private federal corporation like Fannie Mae  FNMA or Freddie Mac, except instead of deploying loan guarantees in support of the mortgage market it would facilitate debt financing markets for the space sector.NASA is looking to spend billions of dollars incentivizing private companies to get America back to the moon, with plans emphasizing robot-controlled landing crafts toting equipment to the lunar surface (as opposed to tourists).In April, NASA selected SpaceX to provide the spacecraft that will carry astronauts to the moon, possibly as soon as 2024.A few years earlier, in a less heralded move, NASA tapped Houston-based Intuitive Machines to build Nova-C, a lunar landing craft. To power it, Intuitive Machines enlisted AAC Clyde Space AB (AAC:FN Stockholm), a leading provider of satellite-related components and services.Based in Sweden, AAC Clyde Space just this past May formally teamed up with the UK affiliate of Japan-based Astroscale, a privately held pioneer in satellite servicing and space debris removal. Now their adventure co-engineering a service craft that in one mission can remove multiple pieces of debris from high-traffic fly zones in Low Earth Orbit certainly won\u2019t get the kind of attention as, say, three billionaires competing to commercialize human space travel.To recap: In July, a supersonic space plane developed by Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic  SPCE successfully reached the edge of space. Branson and three crew members were in it. One week later, Jeff Bezos and three passengers rode on his rocket, New Shepherd, in a ten-minute trip some 62 miles up, across the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Line, a widely recognized, albeit theoretical, border where Earth\u2019s atmosphere ends and space begins (with the air too thin for conventional flight).Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX is developing its Starship to carry humans, and also heavy cargo, to the moon.  In May, the company successfully landed its reusable Starship prototype, SN15. Four previous tries ended in explosions.Bezos\u2019 space company Blue Origin has filed a suit against NASA over the $2.9 billion contract the agency awarded solely to SpaceX (while rejecting bids from Blue Origin and also from a third company, Dynetics).A Blue Origin spokesperson told TechCrunch: \"We firmly believe that the issues identified in this procurement and its outcomes must be addressed to restore fairness, create competition, and ensure a safe return to the moon for America.\"The stakes in the space logistics race are high. But the risks are of a financial nature.Robots handle the real danger.Unmanned crafts with robotic arms can be used to prolong the life of broken or aging satellites, extending life and minimizing future space clutter \u2013 and they can be used to remove existing junk.While a commercially viable model for orbital debris removal has yet to be established, Europe and Japan are placing a priority on developing technologies to address what is now widely acknowledged as a growing, urgent problem.\u201cAn international community is realizing that commerce can be generated in space via a spectrum of activities,\u201d said Tom McCarthy, a former Jet Propulsion Lab veteran, and now head of marketing at Motiv. \u201cMost of the profitable opportunities currently include life extension of well-performing spacecraft by means of augmented propulsion services or refueling, space tugs for repositioning, and eventually assembly and manufacturing on-orbit.\u201dJapan\u2019s Astroscale just signed an agreement to partner with a launch service provider, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, with the goal of innovating space debris removal.Prompting activity and raising the stakes are alarmingly more frequent incidents involving space junk coming dangerously close to the International Space Station.More than 20,000 known and tracked pieces of space debris are currently orbiting Earth, each one traveling at about 15,000-mph, according to Paul M. Sutter, an astrophysicist at SUNY Stony Brook.\"They pose a risk to future space missions,\" he said in a Space.com article last month.\"Nobody is bothering to clean it up.\u201dThat\u2019s because it\u2019s very hard work for which the rewards are still uncertain.The OSAM-1 mission, set for launch in 2024, is trying to be the first-ever in-space inspection, refurbishment and refueling of an aging U.S. government satellite otherwise fated to become space junk. Although exactly which satellite has not been revealed yet; candidates include key weather GPS satellites but there are many strategically important government satellites in need of end-of-life care.At Goddard Space Flight Center, experiments are ramping up as teams of engineers try to perfect an automated robotic arm that can put together a boom and an antenna \u2013 high-precision mechanical assembly \u2013 remotely, in outer space, where no one can hear you scream, nor truly fathom how difficult it is to build such a system.\"What\u2019s so exciting is that here you have an entire ecosystem springing up around satellite servicing and repair with all sorts of new technologies being applied,\" said McCarthy, an engineer and a co-founder of seven-year-old Motiv.McCarthy has enjoyed a long career creating robots for extraterrestrial endeavors, having worked at JPL. That his life\u2019s work would lead him into the gravity-defying realm of satellite repairman strikes him as a fitting trajectory.Satellites are now ubiquitous. As of the start of 2021, some 6,542 satellites were orbiting the earth, according to the Index of Objects Launched into Outer Space, issued by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA). Out of the total, roughly half are active. Half are not i.e. they need to be fixed or de-orbited.Chinese space junk is believed to have damaged the International Space Station. Russian junk reportedly took out a satellite belonging to Iridium. The risks continue to rattle nerves, pushing the issue to the fore.Not everything that falls from way up there is obligated to splash harmlessly into the middle of the Indian Ocean.Space logistics \u2013 hard, not exactly glamorous, nowhere near to being profitable yet \u2013 has a viable future if for no other reason that the liabilities on the table each time a government or company launches anything into orbit, McCarthy explained.\u201cAny activity which involves the engagement and adjustment of any material on orbit requires careful coordination within the space community to ensure safe operations,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIn addition, a well-developed execution plan needs to exist to ensure that materials to be re-entered into Earth\u2019s atmosphere are done in a safe and predictable manner.\u201dThe Foundation for the Future, for its part, remains bent on spurring incentives so that space logistics can flourish. About 100 members of Congress have indicated willingness to co-sponsor legislation, a draft of which, says the trade group's head, is already with the House Legislative Counsel.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.I've covered Wall Street for nearly 25 years, focused mainly on asset management, working for publications such as ABCNews.com, Trader Monthly and Institutional Investor.I've covered Wall Street for nearly 25 years, focused mainly on asset management, working for publications such as ABCNews.com, Trader Monthly and Institutional Investor.

This segment contributes to a small portion of the total Nanosatellite and Microsatellite Market, accounting for approximately six percent during the forecast period. However, the software and data processing segment is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. Factors such as advanced data processing in space are now capable of monitoring agriculture, environmental protection, and geology down on Earth. This, in turn, has the potential to significantly expand the knowledge of what damages the environment, how this change occurs, and at what pacethis devastation takes place. With the help of satellite technology and specialized hyper spectral imaging cameras, this is becoming possible. SaaS cloud-based solutions increase efficiency and cost-effectiveness, along with scalability, remote access to services, and automatic updates of nanosatellites and microsatellites.**Earth Observation and Remote Sensing segment is expected to grow at a higher CAGR during the forecast period**Nanosatellites and microsatellites have brought novel opportunities for Earth observation and remote sensing using inexpensive small satellites to capture images of the Earth and gather specific data. Nanosatellites and microsatellites are expected to play a major role in remote sensing missions due to their enhanced computational and communication capabilities, along with competencies in making decisions about the time and data to be shared. Successful programs to develop and examine advanced hyper spectral imaging systems compatible with nanosatellite and microsatellite missions enable small satellites to generate high-quality complex images. These images can be processed, analyzed, and interpreted quickly using the existing hyper spectral data analyzing software programs. They help in monitoring situations such as cyclones, storms, El Ni\u00f1o, floods, fires, volcanic activities, earthquakes, landslides, oil slicks, environmental pollution, and industrial and power plant disasters.**North America region to record the highest growing region in the Nanosatellite and Microsatellite Market**North America leads to the adoption of nanosatellites and microsatellites and provides great opportunities for growth in the overall market. The region has always been an early adopter of new technology or software, and North America grows at a faster rate initially as compared to any other region. The demand for nanosatellites and microsatellites in North America is being driven by the booming digitization across industries, along with the surging demand for Earth observation satellites. These satellites offer extremely high-resolution Earth images and videos as close as one meter or less of the Earths surface.

The order is valued at approximately USD 1.5 million, and it is estimated that delivery will take place in December 2021. The order is conditional on, apart from customary project items, the ongoing techno-economic feasibility study for this specific project.****The TES.POD** \u00ae **units are intended to be financed, installed, and operated through a project company jointly owned by Azelio and Engazaat Development S.A.E., and be used in the SAVE sustainable agriculture project in Egypt. The 20 TES.POD**\u00ae **units have a combined storage capacity of 3.3 MWh of electricity production and will be part of a mini-grid system to supply farmers with renewable energy, thereby significantly lowering CO 2 emissions, energy related costs, and dependency on diesel. **Egypt-based Engazaat Development S.A.E (Engazaat) specialises in development, implementation, and management of infrastructure systems in the water, technology, and renewable energy sectors. In its sustainable agro-village and entrepreneurship platform project SAVE, at the Moghra Oasis in Egypt, a mini-grid system is planned to supply farmers with 85% of their energy from renewable sources. For the project a conditional order has been placed for 20 of Azelio's TES.POD\u00ae energy storage units, subject to the conditions of an ongoing techno-economic feasibility study for the specific project.

Fanboy Rampage: A Substack Comics Special# Fanboy Rampage: A Substack Comics SpecialPosted on August 13, 2021 by Rich JohnstonRecently, Substack announced a number of comic book creator premium subscriber launches, using the medium to not just talk about comics but to publish them, digitally. Substack has paid premium advances to these creators, recruited by **Nick Spencer**, and **James Tynion IV** has even stated that he is quitting writing _Batman_ to work on Substack, and it looks like **Jonathan Hickman** is doing the same on X-Men after _Inferno_ and _Moira X_. But there is considerable concern regarding Substack's choices of other premium writers on the site, a number who have been excluded from other social media platforms over their writing, specifically those with a transphobic focus. **Jude Doyle** , writer of the upcoming horror comic book _Maw_ from Boom Studios in September, wrote an article a while back called _Substack Is Not a Neutral Platform_, stating that he had\u2026> \"been on the platform since early 2018, when I was recruited by co-founder Hamish McKenzie, who promised me that _  Toast_ founders Daniel Lavery and Nicole Cliffe were satisfied users. Yet, over the past several months, I had watched as the platform morphed into a haven for online transphobia, and when I hit my limit, I hit it hard\u2026 They look, in other words, very much like the TERF movement that has achieved mainstream legitimacy in the U.K., defining the conversation around trans rights and leading to a rollback of those rights. Last September the British government decreed that trans people lacked the right to legally self-identify and in December the British High Court banned gender-affirming health care such as puberty blockers for those under 16. There is every reason to believe that, by allowing this set of writers to define and shape a media consensus against trans people's humanity and right to define ourselves, we are setting ourselves up for the same progression in theThe article was shared by comics writer and producer **Alex De Campi**who also stated> \"Please read this before you consider paying for Substack content; there is an absolutely straight line between giving that company clicks / money and funding anti-trans hate speech. There are ethical ways to create and disseminate your work and Substack is not it. If you want to develop a paid newsletter model, there are several options (Buttondown the leading one) that do not fund harassment of marginalized people by hatred influencers. \"oh but it doesn't hurt ME\" buddy there's a whole Twilight Zone episode about that. \"oh but I'm donating the subscription money\" still keeping that six-figure grant, tho.\"That last was seemingly directed at **Molly Knox Ostertag** and **Chip Zdarsky** , whose substacks state that donations will be made from subscriptions to LGBTQ and trans-related organisations.>   * **Molly Knox Ostertag:** Some housekeeping: I'll be sharing pieces from this series every  **Thursday** , and sharing random drawings and posts every  **Monday**. I will be matching all money earned from paid subscriptions and donating it to various trans charities. To begin, I'll be giving to The Trans Lifeline's Microgrant program, which provides funds for gender-affirming surgery and legal work, with a focus on BIPOC and incarcerated trans folk.>   * **Chip Zdarsky:  **I noticed fellow Substack Professional Molly Ostertag is donating her subscriber money to charity and I think that's a swell idea. So I'm going to do the same. Because this year has been generously funded by a Substack grant, I'm going to donate my portion of the year's subscription money to Rainbow Railroad, a great non-profit that works to help LGBTQI+ people who face persecution globally find safety. It's a great organization.\"Editor and comics writer **Alejandro A. Arbona** tweeted out;> \"This substack thing leaves a foul taste in my mouth. Creators may want it as a way to talk to readers directly and grow the reach of comics, but all I see is a short-lived cash grab. And I'm not about to pay for a newsletter as costly as a movie streaming site to read one comic. I hear substack is bankrolling their creators' first year while they attract subscribers, so every exciting \"I've teamed up with substack\" announcement you see just represents them cashing a big payday and asking you to sign up so that substack won't take a bath on their deal.  Folks, substack just showed up at my door hefting a big canvas sack with a dollar sign on it so I'm excited to announce that I've teamed up with substack for my next creator-owned comic book, so please sign up to my newsletter and \"directly support\" the \"creators\" you \"love\".\"**Marc Andreyko** replied \"I cannot see this business model succeeding. I hope it does, but the odds are not in their favor.\" Comics creator Fraser Campbell had a little to say on his own non-substack newsletter, saying> \"I won't be subscribing, even to creators I might want to support. Substack not only platform a variety of right-wing loonballs, transphobes and general creeps, they pay them to be there. Obviously traditional comics publishers aren't exactly paragons of virtue, but they generally don't deliberately hire bigots to attack the marginalised for cash.\"Comics creator **Ramon Villalobos** tweeted out his take, with responses from comics creator **Phil Hester** and writer **Donny Cates** in a say-you've-got-a-substack-to-announce-without-saying-you've-got-a-substack-to-announce fashion;>   * **Ramon Villalobos:** amused by certain types of comics substack grant people trying to circle the square between being lovable and relatable online personalities and now getting hundreds of thousands of dollars to post and everyone knows it. \"gosh excited about this new adventure were going on gang!\" a lot of them have cultivated parasocial relationships with readers not knowing this moment would ever come but now that it has, and it has paid off, what does the harvest look like. very exciting to watch.\">   * **Phillip Hester** : I would be excited about sudden wealth!>   * **Ramon Villalobos:**   im different, i've always been a miserable and volatile piece of sh-t. rich or poor!>   * **Phillip Hester:** But let's test it.>   * **Ramon Villalobos:**   with peace and love, i talk a lot about the plight of migrant workers and people being held in concentration camps at the border and nobody cares. I gotta get my engagement up some how.>   * **Donny Cates:** Yeah it'd be cooler if hot Twitter takes paid the bills. I'd love to see how you complain about that for attention.>   * **Ramon Villalobos:** im sure i'd find a way, donny>   * **Donny Cates:** Well it's going super great,bud. Shitting on the success of your peer group that has always had your back is getting you a lot of them sweet sweet clicks.>   * **Ramon Villalobos:**   bro i am not sh-tting on anyone's success. im genuinely happy for everyone, i just find the dynamics of the fan interaction interesting. im sorry if that's hurtful to point out. i have friends who got approached to do that and said you should absolutely do it but also encouraged them to think critically about it as well. I dont think I've been unfair about any of this>   * **Donny Cates:** Alright man. You're right. Whatever. I must be imagining things. As you were.Donny Cates, say you have a substack subscription to announce without saying you have a substack subscription to announce. **Jen Bartel** may have one too, according to my Twitter alerts.

Consumer behavior has definitively shifted, with new customer journeys emerging as a result, unsurprisingly these are shorter and simpler and are being supported by new media tech and platform solutions.These new solutions are broadly encapsulated in two trends: the continuing rise of shoppable placements, in its many existing forms, and its logical extension as digital shopfronts. These digital shopfronts are more than DTC websites, they are ads and content that have become themselves digital retail experiences \u2013 places where products can be purchased directly without leaving the content.Asia has been leading the way with this type of content, but what we are seeing is a global acceleration in accessibility, footprint and consumer take-up. So, with omnichannel planning here to stay, the challenge and opportunity for advertisers is to look at each element of their marketing activities and to consider how it could become more shoppable without it jarring as a consumer experience \u2013 elements of full funnel will still apply, albeit with more direct connections to those purchase or trial conversion points.The first step is to maximize the immediate, impulse opportunity (it has many names: shoppable impressions, click to buy, buy it now, add to basket\u2026 formats that are all moving from niche to scalable activations). There are three areas to consider here: social commerce, audio and QR codes, all of which have the power to enable consumers to act on impulse and buy products no matter where they are.Most important is social commerce and at the forefront of this is Instagram. With shoppable posts and a multitude of influencers, it is the key platform for many brands to sell through. L\u2019Or\u00e9al, for example, has used a mixture of content creators and shoppable ads to lift purchases on campaigns globally, with many examples hitting double digit increases. Facebook has launched Shops across its app portfolio, and as shown recently by Missoma, this drives incremental orders in the thousands and improves ad engagement. Similar to Shops is Tik Tok\u2019s partnership with Shopify, with which it signed a commerce partnership last year enabling in-feed and shoppable video ads on the app. Twitter, not wanting to be left behind, is launching a pilot of Shop Module its version of in-app purchasing. Very soon we should be looking at the majority of any social media plan being shoppable \u2013 an opportunity not to be missed and one that advertisers should be testing now.While video is driving much of commerce\u2019s growth, we cannot leave out audio. The brilliant Berocca campaign from Bayer, an early example of the Alexa cart beta, saw ads delivered via Global radio stations through Alexa enabled devices only. The ad ended with a call to action for listeners to interacting with their own voice and vocally stating their interest \u2013 could purchase the product.And finally, QR codes, with the pandemic making them truly mainstream around the globe brands have another way to shorten the purchase journey. Some brands have been using them for a while, like Lacoste, who used them in-store and on static ads but are now using them at televised live events and in its TV ads. Adidas went a step further and built a whole campaign around them, Hidden in Plain Sight, using QR codes to turn poster sites into guerrilla shops for a trainer drop.It\u2019s clear almost any placement can become a shoppable moment, so marketers should be trialing these tactics as they look to build the optimal omnichannel plans. Having said that, it is imperative the right application of a shoppable moment is applied at the right time and it won\u2019t always be appropriate to universally pop a QR code on a creative. We are heading to a future where the purchase journey can be as simple as just a click of the button on your phone or a word into a mic, but you do need to consider the intersection of the person, the place, the time and the media to avoid the epic retail fail. With this sound consideration, there is also an opportunity for deeper retail brand experiences through digital shopfronts.Unsurprisingly, fashion is at the forefront of this. Burberry partnered with Instagram for the launch of a limited-edition collection (B-Series), which was available for 24 hours only through its Instagram account. It sold out within a few hours. This live element is also core part of Amazon Live, in which the platform hosts interactive shoppable livestreams. It is part QVC, part Instagram, but 100% social commerce. The technology enables creators and brands to interact directly with consumers, and the add to basket element could not be simpler.And Facebook as ever is not far behind having already launched in the US its \u2018Live Shopping Fridays\u2019, a series of livestreamed shopping events with brands such as Sephora, Bobbi Brown and Abercrombie & Fitch. Alongside the shopping opportunity, these feature Q&As;, behind the scenes videos and influencer demos.There are hipper more exclusive approaches as well, Bambuser is a live video shopping app, similar to Ntwrk, which it says bridges the gap between traditional retail and e-commerce. The content broadcast on the app mixes influencers, social media ads and the all-important live experience, brands such as Samsung have successfully used it to beat conversion goals by 127% for product launches.Even newspapers are getting in on the act, with The Guardian making every recipe in its weekend food supplement a shoppable experience through QR codes, enabling shoppers to add to basket for Ocado simply by scanning the code.As with any new opportunity, it\u2019s important to test and learn, but also to build on and extend what already works. Turning creators into live shopping presenters, utilizing QR codes on static and dynamic ads, as well as pushing the boundaries of what is possible on Instagram and other social platforms.Moving from shoppable to shopfront impressions is the next step for brands and e-commerce, shortening the consumer journeys, bringing consumers closer and maximizing the sales opportunity for every element of the marketing plan. **Dan Friel is global client president at iProspect, a Dentsu company.** **For more on the reinvention of retail, check out The Drum\u2019s Retail hub, where we explore everything from livestreaming e-commerce to AR shopping and conscious consumerism.**This article is about:  World, Retail, Retail Marketing, Retail Insights, Modern Marketing, Digital Transformation, Retail, BrandShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare to Facebook####  Like what you see?

No progress was made in implementing the Riyadh pact and government return to Aden, Ahmed Bin Mubarak added in remarks carried by Asharq Al-awsat.  At meeting with deputy chief of the US mission in Yemen, Cathy Westley, the Yemeni FM underscored the need for completing the application of the pact, particularly its security and military provisions.(* A P)STC: independence of south Yemen irreversibleVice president of the southern transitional council Hani bin Breik said on Friday the independence of south Yemen is irreversible.The establishment of the new federal state of the south and its return as a member of all international organisations is a fateful issue for the southern people, he wrote on Twitter.There is no solution to the problems of Yemen except with that, he said, adding that the president of the council Aidarous Al-Zubaidi carries peace for the north, the region and the world.(* B P)The Ghani of Afghanistan and Hadi of Yemen.. A rapprochement in behavior and the inevitability of fateThe report of the French agency is remarkably similar to a report issued by the International Crisis Group in April of last year, which dealt in one of its chapters with the situation of President Hadi and the narrow circle that controls him.Where the report likened President Hadi\u2019s situation to that of Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthi group, stressing that he \u201cremains isolated from the outside world,\u201d referring to his residence in Riyadh since 2015, with the exception of short periods he spent in Aden and in a hospital in the United States.The report said that Hadi relies on a small group of family members and political allies to act as his eyes and ears, stressing that this group controls access to him by the United Nations and foreign diplomatic missions.The report added that the inner circle surrounding Hadi consists of allies from his hometown of Abyan in southern Yemen, including his two sons Nasser and Jalal, in addition to figures such as former Prime Minister Ahmed Obaid bin Daghr and Rashad Al-Alimi, in addition to a highly influential staff that includes members of the reform party.The report confirms that the task of this inner circle of Hadi, including many of the ministers, is to preserve Hadi's legitimate authority and the privileges they derive from his position.According to the report, Vice President Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar and Defense Minister Muhammad al-Maqdashi, along with senior Saudi military officials, oversee military and security affairs focused in the northeast, Marib and Taiz, while Hadi\u2019s son, Nasser, and other key allies of Abyan manage most of the military affairs. and security in the south in coordination with them.The convergence in behavior and performance between Hadi and Ghani, does not mean that Hadi is following the path of Ghani. Rather, it can be said that Ghani is the one who walked the path of Hadi.Yemenis hold protest rallies against presence of foreign troops in al-MahrahYemenis have taken to streets in the country\u2019s eastern province of al-Mahrah to express their strong dissent against the presence of foreign troops, some six years after a Saudi-led military coalition began an offensive against the impoverished nation.

This means the issuance of passports will be disrupted, directly affecting thousands of people wishing to travel.Hadi\u2019s decision to move the department\u2019s issue center from Yemen to Jeddah is set to cause frequent interruptions in passport issuance processes as well as delayed acquisition.Additionally, the move directly violates Yemen\u2019s national sovereignty, allowing Saudi Arabia and its agencies to access the data of Yemeni citizens.Yemeni premier urges int'l support for economic stabilityThe Yemeni prime minister on Tuesday called on the international community to establish an urgent regional and international course in support of his government plans to achieve economic stability and avoid dangerous complications of a wider humanitarian crisis in Yemen.More and more people leave their houses and never come back in Aden, an unresolved mystery./ Hayroot websiteEmirati soldier abducted by al-QaedaPro-STC club of judges forms judicial authority for south YemenThe southern club of judges which is loyal to the southern transitional council on Monday formed the supreme southern judicial authority and announced the reopening of courts and prosecution offices.The move came two days after Yemen's internationally recognised president Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi ordered the governor of the interim capital Aden to reopen the judicial compound.

**Yemen** Hans Grundberg may have a shot at restoring peace in the country \u2013 if he zeroes in on its political crisis rather than the humanitarian aspects, experts say.Oman-based Houthi negotiator Mohammed Abdulsalam tweeted that there was no use having any dialogue before airports and ports are opened as a humanitarian necessity and priority.But Mohammed Alragawi, a research fellow at Yemeni think tank Abaad Studies and Research Center, said solving the political unrest will lead to reducing the effects on the other aspects of the crisis and eventually end the humanitarian need.\"Mr Grundberg will be able to make a difference if he makes use of the lesson learned from previous UN envoys to Yemen. He should not repeat Griffiths' mistake of dividing the crisis into small components, but rather look at the crisis as one block and find a comprehensive and sustainable solution,\" Alragawi said.Abdulghani Al-Iryani, who previously worked with the UN in the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen and the UN Development Programme mission in Hodeidah in Yemen, believes Grundberg has a better chance at bringing about change, given his experience as the EU ambassador to the country.Grundberg, he said, should remove the UN Security Council resolutions, which have served as an obstacle to any serious negotiations. The second step would be to include Yemeni parties that have been marginalized.\"The tendency of international approach in the past was to reward warlords by saying that the discussions will only be between all those who are fighting,\" said Al-Iryani, who is also a senior researcher at the Yemen-based Sanaa Center for Strategic Studies. \u201cSo (Grundberg) needs to broaden the dialogue, include political and civil forces, civil actors.\"Houthi official foretells peace deal with Saudi ArabiaSana'a and Riyadh may reach an accord for peace, security and good-neighbor policy, the Houthi-appointed deputy foreign minister tweeted on Monday.

Hundreds of medical staff, academics and other professionals in the kingdom's southern region bordering Yemen have in recent weeks been told they are being let go, several Yemenis told _Reuters_.The exact number is not known. Staff said they were not provided justification for government orders to stop renewing contracts of Yemenis.There has been no official explanation and Saudi and Yemeni authorities did not respond to _Reuters_ requests for comment. Yemeni sources who spoke to _Reuters_ said they did not know why the dismissals were happening and were unwilling to advance any theories.A Saudi analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the move aimed to free up jobs for citizens in the south as part of efforts to tackle Saudi unemployment of 11.7%, and was also driven by security considerations in areas near the war, in which a Saudi-led coalition is fighting Yemen's Houthi group.A Yemeni government source, speaking on condition of anonymity due to political sensitivities, said the directives could affect \"tens of thousands\" of Yemenis, including labourers. The source did not know why the orders were issued.Saudi Arabia hosts 2 million Yemeni workers, according to the Sanaa Center for Strategic Studies. It is unclear how many are in the south.Most send money home where prospects are bleak due to the war.

The amendment would prevent the US from providing logistical support, intelligence, weapons, or US personnel/contractors to Saudi Arabia to aid their aerial and naval blockade against the Houthis in Yemen.As the chair of the House Armed Services Committee, Smith holds major sway over negotiations on the expansive package. If he wanted to, he could indicate his support for the amendment, commit to keeping it in the NDAA, and then we could all move on with our lives. Shouldn't be too hard. After all, he cosponsored a similar amendment in 2019 and fought hard for the one-year ban on arms sales to the Saudis, even when Trump had \"made it absolutely clear that he'd throw the bill out the window if it included anything that would piss off Saudi Arabia,'\" as _The Stranger_ reported at the time.But this year, when Democrats control the House, the Senate, and the White House (at least for the next few months), Smith has yet to commit. He also hasn't signed on to any of the many letters from members of Congress trying to push Biden on the issue.Eliminating Saudi Arabia's ability to enforce their blockades by refusing to maintain their planes and provide logistical support would help bring this man-made disaster to an end. Smith was willing to sign his name to a similar measure when he had less power to push it through. In the coming days, we'll see if he remains committed despite mixed-messages from Biden. Of course, if you want to give him a little encouragement, you know where to find him.(* B P)If Congress is Yemen\u2019s Only Hope, Yemen is DoomedYou may have noticed a growing number of articles on progressive websites with titles like: \u201cCongress Needs to Force Biden to End the Yemen War\u201d ( _Common Dreams_); \u201cThe President Has Not Ended the War on Yemen; Congress Must Do So\u201d ( _Counterpunch_); and \u201cIf Biden Can\u2019t Stand Up to Saudi Arabia, Then Congress Should, and Now\u201d (Quincy Center for Responsible Statecraft).The writers of these articles are a lot more optimistic than I am. Should Congress end US support for the Saudi Arabia-led war on Yemen? Yes. Absolutely. Will Congress do so? I have doubts.Peace activists have turned to Congress out of frustration with President Joe Biden. Biden has only partially fulfilled his February 4 pledge to end all US support for the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s \u201coffensive operations\u201d (a slippery phrase which gives the administration room to argue that any operation it supports is defensive).Are there enough votes in Congress to override a hypothetical Biden veto? It takes 67 votes in the Senate to override a presidential veto.[2] Currently, the Senate is evenly split between 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans.[3] If all 50 Senate Democrats vote to override Biden\u2019s veto, they will need to be joined by 17 Republican senators. Are there 17 Republican senators who will vote to end US support for the Saudi coalition?I think we can count on a few Republicans doing the right thing.Legislators who are determined to vote against a new WPR have a handy excuse: Iran. Hawks have convinced themselves that the coalition must win or the Iran-backed Houthi rebels will turn Yemen into an Iranian satellite. Maybe. But just how does blowing up 40 school children with a bomb supplied by US defense contractor Lockheed Martin, as the coalition did on August 9, 2018, harm Iran? You may wonder the same thing about the Saudi coalition\u2019s deliberate strategy of creating a famine in Yemen through its blockade of ships carrying food, fuel, and medicine and wanton bombing of water treatment and food production facilities. These are war crimes. By aiding the coalition, the US shares the coalition\u2019s guilt.The fall of Afghanistan this week provides hawks in Congress with a fresh argument against ending US support to the Saudis: \u201cWe can\u2019t cut and run from Yemen the way we did from Afghanistan.\u201d It\u2019s a silly argument, but it will play well on Fox News.THE SWAMP: @EdRRoyce, chair of the @HouseForeign Affairs Committee from 2013-2019, registered this week to lobby for Saudi Arabia.

The Europeans and their US master had broken the Nuclear Deal.(* B P)How to Make Iran Trust a New Nuclear DealEven if Washington can\u2019t provide a guarantee that future administrations will maintain the deal, there are other ways to bridge the gap.Biden has sincerely sought an agreement since mid-March. Yet, the cost of his dithering during his first two months in office is only starting to become clear now. What could have been resolved with the government of former Iranian President Hassan Rouhani instead has become entangled in Iranian election politics, as many warned it would unless Biden acted quickly. Predictably, Iran\u2019s new hard-line president now seems poised to drive a harder bargain and, by that, potentially jeopardize the opportunity to revive the landmark agreement.A key sticking point is Tehran\u2019s demand that Washington guarantee that future administrations won\u2019t quit the deal again. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s reimposition of sanctions inflicted unprecedented damage on the Iranian economy, and Iran bizarrely found itself under more sanctions after it had signed and complied with the nuclear deal than when it stood accused of violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\u201cThere is no such thing as a guarantee,\u201d lead negotiator Robert Malley said last month, as future administrations must enjoy the freedom to make their own choices. If the agreement is sufficiently attractive, future administrations will stick to it, the U.S. side has argued.Yet, a guarantee to never build nuclear weapons is precisely what the United States asked of Iran in the 2015 nuclear deal. The third preamble of the agreement reads: \u201cIran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.\u201dIran was asked and did provide such a guarantee in writing. The U.S. side insists it cannot do the same because it is a democracy.My comment: The US point of view is mad. Genereally, international treaties also bind future government and cannot be refuted after every change in government. A state never could claim such a freedom because it labels itself as a \u201cdemocracy\u201d \u2013 a thing Iran certainly also would claim for itself.UN nuclear watchdog: Iran producing more uranium metalIran continues to produce uranium metal, which can be used in the production of a nuclear bomb, the United Nation\u2019s atomic watchdog confirmed Tuesday, in a move that further complicates the possibility of reviving a landmark 2015 deal with world powers on the Iranian nuclear program.In a report issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna to member nations, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said that his inspectors had confirmed on Saturday that Iran had now produced 200 grams of uranium metal enriched up to 20%.(* B P)Wikipedia: Iran\u2013Saudi Arabia proxy conflictThe Iran\u2013Saudi Arabia proxy conflict, sometimes also referred to as the Middle Eastern Cold War,[73] is the ongoing struggle for influence in the Middle East and surrounding regions between Iran and Saudi Arabia.[74] The two countries have provided varying degrees of support to opposing sides in nearby conflicts, including the civil wars in Syria[75][76][77] and Yemen.(B K P)Experte: Gro\u00dfbritannien streben erneute Besetzung des Jemen anNach Aussagen eines jemenitischen Experten, zielt die j\u00fcngste Entscheidung des Vereinigten K\u00f6nigreichs, Truppen unter einem falschen Vorwand in den Jemen zu verlegen, tats\u00e4chlich darauf ab, das verarmte Land erneut unter die britische Besatzung zu bringen.Yousef al-Hadheri machte diese \u00c4u\u00dferungen am Mittwoch bei einem Interview mit Press TV \u00fcber den Einsatz der britischen Truppen in der s\u00fcdjemenitischen Provinz al-Mahrah.London hat die Streitkr\u00e4fte unter dem Vorwand dorthin geschickt, die mutma\u00dflichen T\u00e4ter hinter einem gemeldeten Angriff vom 29.

Essential telecom infrastructure, such as mobile towers and fibre cabling, has often been targeted, destroyed, or damaged by the opposing sides in the ongoing conflict. These difficulties have proved to be a disincentive to telcos investing in infrastructure, with the result that the country lacks basic fixed-line infrastructure, and mobile services are based on outdated GSM. This has prevented the development of a mobile broadband sector, or the evolution of mobile data services.The ownership of telecommunication services, and the scrutiny of associated revenues and taxes, have become a political issue in Yemen. In 2019 the recognised government moved Tele Yemen\u2019s headquarters from Sana\u2019a to Aden in a bid to regain control of the company.Until telecom infrastructure can be improved across Yemen, and until civil unrest eases, there will be little progress for the sector.https://virtual-strategy.com/2021/08/19/yemen-telecoms-mobile-and-broadband-statistics-and-analyses/ = https://ca.movies.yahoo.com/yemen-telecoms-mobile-broadband-statistics-121900480.html(A E P)The Houthi militia's self-styled \"central bank\" in Sana'a issues a circular reminding traders to double check the bands of 1000 riyal banknotes to make sure the notes printed recently by the government are eliminated from the markets in the militia's areas of control./ Multiple websitesThe Houthi militia have confiscated 41 million worth of the government-printed 1000-riyal banknotes from traders coming from Aden in their way to the militia-controlled parts of Taiz city.

Therefore the malignant regional players are pressuring Hadi to expedite \"ending the war\" by a government forces' withdrawal similar to that which has happened in Afghanistan. /Series of tweets by Sam Alghobari.The Houthi terrorist militia arrest directors of their own so-called \"police stations\" in Sana'a/Khabar News Agency.Three human bodies have been found beheaded in Saada,the stronghold of the Houthi militia /Voice of Yemen website(A K P)A human rights information center (HRITC) has documented 70 Houthi abuses against civilians in Taiz last July./Yemen Talk.My comment: STC separatist propaganda.Chris Evans goes full Captain America, assembling a cavalcade of warmongering Washington avengers to discuss the Middle EastThe gullible Hollywood star exposes himself to be a useful idiot for the military/intelligence industrial complex by producing a blindly orthodox new six-part discussion series on Yemen, Iran, Palestine, Syria and Saudi Arabia.As the US limps out of Afghanistan with its tail between its legs, and millions suffer and die under the most brutal of American-induced maladies from Syria to Palestine to Yemen and across the Middle East, I implore you to fear not, as Captain America is now on the case.Chris Evans, the movie star best known for playing the patriotic leader of the Avengers, Steve Rogers, in the multi-billion-dollar Marvel Cinematic Universe, is out to solve the world\u2019s problems and has set his dazzling blue eyes and decidedly empty head on the mess that is the Middle East.Cartoon: Political solutions to the conflict in #Yemen.More Saudi coalition \u201eWe are benefactors\u201c propaganda## cp16 Saudische Luftangriffe / Saudi air raids(* A K pH)Saudi coalition air raids and shelling day by dayAug. 20: https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/a.551858951631141/2103871116429909/Aug. 19: https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/a.551858951631141/2103870613096626/Aug. 18: https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/a.551858951631141/2103134086503612/Aug. 17: https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/a.551858951631141/2103133553170332/Aug. 16: https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/a.551858951631141/2103132983170389/Aug. 15: https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/a.551858951631141/2099688836848137/Aug. 14: https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/a.551858951631141/2099688190181535/Aug. 13: https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/a.551858951631141/2098833333600354/Aug. 12: https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/a.551858951631141/2098827606934260/Aug. 11: https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/a.551858951631141/2098826040267750/Aug. 10: https://www.facebook.com/lcrdye/photos/a.551858951631141/2098825443601143/(A K pH)Aggression's airstrike kills man in Hodeida10 Houthis killed in Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen's Marib: gov't sourceTen Houthi rebels were killed by Saudi-led Arab coalition airstrikes in Yemen's central province of Marib on Saturday, a Yemeni government military source told Xinhua.\"The ten, including three high-ranking leaders, were hit while driving in two vehicles in Sirwah district, a few miles east of Al-Kasarah frontline,\" the source in Marib said on condition of anonymity.(A K P)Teheran bestreitet Anwesenheit iranischer Milit\u00e4rberater im JemenDer Sprecher des Au\u00dfenministeriums der Islamischen Republik Iran hat eine Behauptung der Regierung des jemenitischen Ex-Pr\u00e4sidenten Abed Rabbo Mansur Hadi \u00fcber den angeblichen Tod eines iranischen Staatsb\u00fcrgers im Jemen dementiert und erkl\u00e4rt, im Jemen halte sich kein iranischer Milit\u00e4rberater auf.Der Au\u00dfenamtssprecher Irans f\u00fcgte hinzu: \u201eSolche unbegr\u00fcndeten \u00c4u\u00dferungen \u00e4ndern weder die Realit\u00e4t der jemenitischen Szene angesichts der feigen Angriffe der von Saudi-Arabien angef\u00fchrten Kriegskoalition noch die Entschlossenheit der Jemeniten gegen\u00fcber der Aggression.\u201cund auch https://de.irna.ir/news/84444229/Khatibzadeh-Es-gibt-keinen-iranischen-Milit%C3%A4rberater-im-Jemen(A K pS)Arabic Coalition airstrike kills Iranian expert: [Hadi gov.] Yemen\u2019s Information MinisterIranian expert Haidar Sirjan and nine other Iran-backed Houthi militants including two colonels have been killed following an airstrike by the Arab Coalition forces on Houthi militia sites in Marib, according to Yemen\u2019s minister of information Moammar al-Eryani.and also https://english.alaraby.co.uk/news/top-iranian-expert-killed-yemen-government-ministerMy comment: This sounds like odd propaganda.

Personalised experiences took this one step further, providing one-on-one attention and targeted, tailored offers, treating shoppers as individuals. In the last year, with lockdown forcing millions to shop from their screens, the retail industry can no longer rely on connecting with consumers through physical in-store destinations.It now needs to re-think its strategy, investing in new tech to create more powerful and engaging online experiences. While online shopping is already well-established, a worrying number of retailers have missed a trick in this respect. It needs to move beyond the convenience of \u2018click to buy\u2019 and \u2018click to collect\u2019, to embrace all the best bits of the physical shop - namely the human contact. Think interactions, recommendations and creating a lasting, memorable experience.With in-store sales continuing to play catch-up in the wake of Covid-19, it\u2019s a \u2018do or die\u2019 moment for many retailers. Technology is the answer and this is where livestream shopping has come into its own as a worthy contender, throwing a lifeline to retailers. Already well-established and successful in China - generating $170 billion in 2020, according to iResearch, livestream shopping is the next big thing to enter the world of e-commerce. It integrates influencer marketing, live videos and entertainment, and allows audiences to interact and converse with brands.If you think about shopping channel QVC and the numbers that it generates, livestream shopping is a mouthwatering prospect - essentially taking the QVC home shopping model but making it faster, more in-your-face and with increased interaction. It\u2019s also highly targeted due to the nature of online audiences. Crucially, it appeals to the hard-to-reach Gen Z, giving brands some ready-made content (their products) that they can use to connect and bond with a younger demographic. Convenience is a factor too. You can simply swipe to buy and perform a host of other interactions at the same time, such as engaging with an influencer/presenter, reading reviews and sharing the stream with friends. And you\u2019re doing all of this from the same device and without leaving the platform.## Social media and fashion brands leading activityFacebook launched Instagram Live in the US last year, while TikTok also recently announced the development of TikTok Live Stream Shopping, an e-commerce experience allowing users to purchase items from online retailers during live-streamed events. YouTube is the latest media platform to announce a pilot livestream, having previously tested an integrated shopping feature with video-on-demand.TikTok\u2019s move follows two tie-ups with WalMart. In December, the retailer used the platform to sell its products at a \u2018Holiday Shop-Along Spectacular\u2019 livestream, with Walmart CMO William White saying livestreams are \u2018what users want\u2019. This was followed by a second Walmart-hosted livestream on TikTok in March, a beauty shopping event featuring skincare, make-up and hair routines and products. And it\u2019s not just about the purchases - it\u2019s about the entertainment and educational factors too. In Walmart\u2019s example, alongside the chance to buy, viewers streamed a 60-minute interactive tutorial featuring tips from beauty and make-up influencers such as Gabby Morrison.Gucci Live has also experimented with the concept. During lockdown, it enabled its customers to communicate in real time with its client advisors via a video call on their mobiles and laptops. For the luxury brand, it was about replicating a valued in-store experience remotely and providing customers with the opportunity to benefit from store staff\u2019s expertise. Swedish clothing brand Monki, owned by H&M; Group, has been offering livestream shopping since 2019, through Swedish livestream platform Bambuser. According to the brand, it sees livestream as a channel enabling it to take \u2018community co-creation one step further\u2019.The time factor is all important too, with livestreams playing into people\u2019s fear of missing out, prompting those all-important swipes and purchases from a captive audience. A Tommy Hilfiger livestream in China last August attracted 14 million viewers, resulting in 1,300 hoodies selling out in just two minutes.L\u2019Oreal and US department store chain Nordstrom are the latest brands to bet on livestream shopping. In June, the skincare company partnered with platform Livescale to host a three-day beauty festival, while Nordstrom created its own livestream channel earlier this year featuring brands such as Burberry. Nordstrom\u2019s approach is as much about giving its customers real-time access to retail experts as it is about shopping for the latest styles. So far there have been fashion tips on how to wear Burberry runway looks with Q&A; sessions and virtual styling experiences.Compared to China, livestream shopping in the western world is still in the early stages, but it\u2019s an exciting prospect and is challenging brands to strive for content that is relevant, relatable and trustworthy. As live streaming and immersive techs in VR and AI evolve, the digital opportunities for brands to connect with their audience will expand. From sitting in the front row at a VR fashion show to trying out in-game digital outfits - the appetite for new, immersive digital experiences will continue to grow. **Mark Mitchell, chief innovation officer and co-founder atLively Agency.**This article is about:  World, Digital Advertising, Agency Business, Digital Transformation, Marketing Services, Media, AgencyShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare to Facebook####  Like what you see?

But five years on, the evidence against him looks seriously flawedby  Joe DykeMain image: Palestinian children fly kites featuring images of Mohammed El Halabi in Beit Hanoun, Gaza. Photograph: NurPhoto/GettyThu 19 Aug 2021 06.00 BST Last modified on Wed 25 Aug 2021 12.11 BSTAt about 9am on 12 July 2016, dozens of Israeli security officers stormed through the gates of the Augusta Victoria hospital complex in East Jerusalem. They surged past the hospital, which mostly serves the local Palestinian population, and through the main car park to a three-storey building where the offices of the international charity World Vision were located.The officers, some armed with rifles, ordered the charity\u2019s few dozen staff into a meeting room and seized their phones to prevent them contacting the outside world. According to witnesses, they were kept there for the next four hours. Occasionally, Israeli police and intelligence agents called an employee out of the room for questioning, while others roamed the offices, searching through files.As the most senior staff member on site, Conny Lenneberg, an Australian who was then head of World Vision\u2019s Middle East operations, was the only one allowed to leave the room. According to Lenneberg, officers aggressively demanded copies of World Vision\u2019s financial records for the past few years. In one hallway, Lenneberg came upon an Israeli intelligence agent questioning World Vision\u2019s finance director, an Ethiopian man, about the charity\u2019s systems for preventing fraud. \u201cThey kept saying: \u2018You just said that but now you are saying something different.\u2019 They got him totally confused,\u201d Lenneberg recalled. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really seem to have a clue what they were looking for. Our sense was they didn\u2019t really understand our systems.\u201d After four hours, as quickly as they had arrived, the officers left.Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morningThey never said his name, but the staff knew the raid was connected to the disappearance of Mohammed El Halabi. A month earlier, Halabi, the 38-year-old head of World Vision\u2019s Gaza office, had been arrested as he walked through the Erez checkpoint between Gaza and Israel. Nothing had been heard of him since. A few weeks after Halabi\u2019s arrest, Lenneberg had flown to Jerusalem to seek more information from Israeli authorities.On 4 August, three weeks after the raid, Israel\u2019s Shin Bet intelligence service made an extraordinary announcement. It said that Halabi had confessed to diverting $7.2m a year, for the past seven years, to the Islamist militant group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. More than $1m a year had allegedly been delivered in cash to combat units. In total, Halabi was accused of stealing up to $50m meant for desperate Palestinians and giving it to Hamas to buy rockets and build tunnels. If true, it would be perhaps the largest theft of aid money in history.For the Israeli government it was a PR coup. It had long accused Hamas of diverting international aid intended for Gaza to fund its wars against the Jewish state. Now it claimed it had proof. \u201cWe were all totally shocked by the scale of the allegations \u2013 the Israelis hadn\u2019t given us any warning, just a big announcement,\u201d says Sharon Marshall, World Vision\u2019s head of communications based in Canada.World Vision, which was founded in the US in 1950, is one of the world\u2019s biggest charities, with an annual budget of more than $2bn. Heavily funded by western governments and US Christian groups, it operates in more than 80 countries and works to support more than 40 million of the world\u2019s poorest children. The arrest of one of its directors made headlines around the world. Foreign governments, including Australia and Germany, stopped all funding to World Vision\u2019s projects in Gaza.On 11 August 2016, then Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a populist with a knack for seizing the political moment, made a special address on his official YouTube channel. \u201cI, the prime minister of Israel, care more about Palestinians than their own leaders,\u201d he said in English, speaking straight into the camera in his clipped American accent. \u201cA few days ago the world learned that Hamas, the terrorist organisation that rules Gaza, stole millions of dollars from humanitarian organisations like World Vision and the United Nations.\u201d He concluded: \u201cHamas stole critical support for Palestinian children so they could kill our children.\u201dYet gaps in the Israeli case rapidly appeared. Israel alleges Halabi was an underground Hamas operative who infiltrated the charity and silenced his colleagues through fear, but those who know Halabi reject these accusations. They describe Halabi as a dedicated family man who was supportive to colleagues, opposed Hamas politically and was, above all, committed to delivering aid to his people. Israel\u2019s case has been further undermined by an independent forensic audit of World Vision\u2019s operations, conducted by one of the world\u2019s largest accountancy firms, which found no funds missing and no evidence of criminal activity.Halabi has been in prison for five years and two months while the case drags through the Israeli courts. If found guilty, he faces decades in prison. The prosecution rested heavily on secret evidence, some of which even the defence team say they were not allowed to view, prompting a UN special rapporteur to condemn proceedings as \u201cnot worthy of a democratic state\u201d.Like other Palestinians charged by Israel, Halabi says he has been offered a series of plea deals, but unlike most prisoners before him, he has rejected them all. His first lawyer, and even an Israeli judge, urged him to accept, knowing that refusal can lead to longer jail terms. His current lawyer claims Halabi received offers that would have led to his immediate release with time served, allowing him to return to his wife and children in Gaza. But Halabi insists he is innocent of the charges, and has refused to make a deal. The arguments in court concluded in July this year, but Halabi remains in prison awaiting a verdict, which is expected this autumn.The Israeli legal system, and the plea deal agreements on which its machinery turns, has been challenged by one man who refuses to accept his fate. World Vision\u2019s former programme quality director, Simon Manning, said that Halabi, who he worked with closely for several years, is a \u201cstubborn\u201d man who sticks to his principles. Manning was not surprised to hear Halabi had held out. \u201cWhen they arrested Mohammed, they really had no idea who they were dealing with.\u201dWorking in Gaza has long presented a challenge for aid organisations. The tiny territory, squeezed between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea, is among the poorest in the world \u2013 more than two-thirds of its population rely on some form of humanitarian aid, according to the UN. But Gaza is controlled and run by Hamas, who took control after elections in 2007 and have since since fought four wars with Israel.As Hamas is considered a terrorist organisation by most western nations, aid agencies cannot deal with them for fear of falling foul of sanctions. Large aid organisations have implemented strict processes to try to prevent money being co-opted or stolen \u2013 known in the industry as aid diversion \u2013 but theft can still occur.Itay Epshtain, a special adviser to the Norwegian Refugee Council, which also provides aid in Gaza, described the rigorous mechanisms charities adopt to prevent aid diversion. \u201cYou do repeat monitoring \u2013 going back to check multiple times that if you provided a water pump or a hospital bed it is still there and operating as it should be. On top of that you have pre-planned and continuous external auditing to check how every dollar is spent.\u201d In Gaza there was additional scrutiny as the Israeli government and some monitor organisations routinely make \u201cbad faith\u201d allegations that aid is being stolen by Hamas. \u201cIt absorbs a lot of management time,\u201d he said.The Israeli charge sheet listed 12 accusations against Halabi. Most, such as the claim he took part in a 2014 Hamas military exercise, were nearly impossible to assess without seeing the secret evidence the Israelis claimed to have. But others were easier to investigate. Halabi was accused of working with two agricultural companies, Al-Atar and Arcoma, which allegedly had ties to Hamas. The charge sheet claimed that, as head of World Vision\u2019s Gaza office, Halabi had rigged the bidding process to ensure the two companies won \u201cnearly all\u201d contracts for providing food aid. Halabi and the companies then allegedly conspired to overcharge World Vision for their services, and funnelled the extra cash to Hamas.In late August 2016, a few weeks after Halabi was charged, I visited the Al-Atar company headquarters in Gaza, where I found a forklift truck piling potatoes into a pickup. The manager, Saqer Al-Atar, ushered me into his office. Atar insisted he had no relations with Hamas and that all contracts with World Vision were negotiated not with the Gaza team but the Jerusalem office. He said he barely knew Halabi. \u201cI only know what he looks like. Maybe I wished him good morning once,\u201d he said.Mohammad El Halabi seen here in 2016 before a hearing at Beersheba district court. Photograph: Dudu Grunshpan/ReutersWorld Vision later confirmed that its total contracts with Al-Atar were worth a little over $30,000 a year for the past decade. The contracts awarded to Arcoma, which also denied any links to Hamas, amounted to about $80,000 a year. Between them, the two companies had won fewer than 50% of the bids for contracts with World Vision they entered, the organisation said.The second of the 12 charges alleged that Halabi had transferred \u201cthousands of tonnes of iron\u201d meant for agricultural projects to Hamas, knowing it would be used to build tunnels under the Israeli border. World Vision said it had never imported iron into Gaza, nor bought any there, and any transaction of this scale would necessarily have involved the Jerusalem office, which meant Halabi could not have acted alone.World Vision had provided a series of aid programmes in Gaza, ranging from education to psychological support and healthcare. In most cases they worked with local Palestinian organisations to implement the projects, and their partners were subject to vetting and security checks. Near the Israeli border in Beit Lahia, a farmer named Ayman Suboh showed off his strawberries. His farmland was near a Hamas base and had been badly battered in Israeli strikes during the war. World Vision provided thousands of dollars to help him rebuild. They carried out regular and often rigorous inspections of goods and products they had paid for, he said, to ensure the money was correctly spent. \u201cMy hair would turn white as they inspected the corners (of the farm) and the plastic sheets, one by one,\u201d he said.During several days of investigation in Gaza, which I wrote about at the time for Agence France Presse, I found nothing to corroborate the Israeli allegations. But there were other charges I could not assess, based as they were on Halabi\u2019s confession, which has never been made public, as well as on financial records and secret evidence.In the days after Israel\u2019s announcement, World Vision\u2019s leaders were in emergency meetings. They had seen no evidence of Halabi\u2019s alleged wrongdoings, but the Israeli accusations threatened not just their support to Palestinians but the charity\u2019s entire future. If Hamas had indeed breached World Vision\u2019s systems, it meant all their work was vulnerable to manipulation. Within two weeks of the Shin Bet press conference, Germany and Australia suspended all funding for World Vision projects in Gaza. The Australians threatened to cut all funding to World Vision globally, about $40m a year.On 6 August, World Vision\u2019s then president Kevin Jenkins set up a crisis team. Chaired by the charity\u2019s chief administrative officer, Andrew Morley, at first the team met daily via video link. It had about 10 members, some in the region and others in head office. They had to deal with strong emotions inside the organisation. A decade earlier, allegations of corruption had emerged against a number of senior World Vision staff in Liberia. After receiving proof of their guilt, the organisation cut the staff off, and provided evidence to the prosecution. Some in senior management favoured a similar approach to Halabi, Lenneberg recalled. \u201cThey would say: \u2018Why would the Israeli authorities go out so prominently with such a huge media campaign if there wasn\u2019t some truth to it?\u2019 It was a very difficult conversation.\u201d Others, particularly those based in the Middle East who knew Halabi, argued he must be treated as innocent until proven guilty.They reached a compromise: World Vision would pay Halabi\u2019s legal fees unless and until it was presented with clear evidence of his guilt. Those fees could run into hundreds of thousands of dollars. (World Vision declined to comment on the exact cost so far.) The same month, it commissioned Deloitte, one of the world\u2019s largest auditing firms, and US law firm DLA Piper to review all their spending, which one source said cost an additional $7m (World Vision declined to confirm this). The results would reveal fundamental problems with the Israeli case.Like most Palestinians, Mohammed El Halabi was born a refugee. His grandparents fled their home in the 1948 conflict that led to the creation of Israel. The Halabis set up base 15 miles south of their village in what later became the Jabalia refugee camp. Halabi\u2019s father, Khalil, worked at the UN relief and works agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA), which runs the majority of schools and medical facilities in Gaza. He became special adviser to the organisation\u2019s then Gaza director, Robert Turner, and attended meetings with western politicians including Tony Blair and John Kerry.Halabi was born in 1978, his parents\u2019 first son. He did well at school, and in his teenage years took a growing interest in the wider world. At the time, foreign cultural and political delegations would visit Gaza, and his father recalls that Halabi used to attend meetings to learn about politics and practise his English. After leaving school, he went on to study engineering at the Islamic University of Gaza. The Israeli prosecution would later claim that this choice of university, which they alleged had links with Hamas, was an indication of his sympathies. His family say it was the best university for engineering in Gaza, and point out he was a member of the university\u2019s Fatah club, the secular party that opposes Hamas.The wider Halabi family are open opponents of Hamas. One time in early 2019, Mohammed\u2019s younger brother Hamed turned up for an interview with me nursing a cut to his head. He said he had been taking part in rare demonstrations in Gaza against Hamas rule when security forces beat and briefly detained him.In the early 00s, longtime Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, angered by the failure of peace deals, rallied his Fatah militia for a second uprising or intifada. But his control over the Palestinian movement was waning, and Hamas was rising, driven by a zeal Arafat\u2019s secular cadres had long lost. Hamas leaders encouraged young recruits to blow themselves up on Israeli buses, killing scores of civilians. In the Israeli military crackdown that followed, Palestinians were subjected to nightly raids and curfews, with families often trapped in their homes for weeks.In the midst of the fighting, in 2003, Halabi\u2019s family chose a wife for him. A few hundred people crammed into the Abu Haseera hotel along Gaza\u2019s Mediterranean coast for his wedding to Ola. Two years later, the couple had the first of their five children. In 2004, as conditions in Gaza became harsher, Halabi decided to swap engineering for aid work. The question of what motivated that change is at the root of the charges against him.The Israeli charge sheet states that \u201cduring the year 2004 or thereabouts\u201d, Halabi was approached by a Hamas militant, allegedly a commander in a small cell that included Halabi\u2019s brother Diaa. (His brother Hamed says this is untrue. The UN confirmed that Diaa works as a nurse in one of their hospitals.) Because Halabi spoke English, a rare skill in Gaza, the militant allegedly decided his role would be to infiltrate an aid agency and work for Hamas from there.Palestinians protesting against Halabi\u2019s imprisonment in Gaza City. Photograph: Mohammed Salem/ReutersYears later, Halabi explained his move in rather different terms, in an interview from 2014 in which he was described as a \u201chumanitarian hero\u201d by the UN. \u201cAfter an invasion in my area which killed dozens of people and destroyed several houses, I decided to leave my work as an engineer and turn to humanitarian work,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to be able to help civilians and especially children.\u201dIn 2005, Halabi got his first job with World Vision, supporting the office manager in Gaza City. The prosecution would later suggest the process by which he was employed was rigged. However, a World Vision employee at the time, an American who did not want to be named owing to their current senior role in the aid industry, said the first round of the hiring process was a test that was marked blind \u2013 meaning all details of the candidates were removed. Those who passed were interviewed by a panel of several staff, including the head of the Jerusalem office. The panel agreed unanimously that Halabi was the best candidate, the former employee said. \u201cHe came in with a lot of really good ideas, but wanted to learn from World Vision.\u201dOver several years, Halabi and the American former employee formed a close bond, professionally and personally. \u201cI had worked with other staff in a similar capacity in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, and Mohammed was in many respects the star pupil,\u201d the former employee said.Halabi rose fast, and in 2014 was promoted to head of the Gaza office. When there was fighting in Gaza, he was known for going to his staff\u2019s homes to see how they were doing, despite the potential risks. His rotund form and round cheery face were well loved. \u201cWhen you turned up at any of our projects, kids that knew him would run to him. The staff lit up when he walked into a room,\u201d Lenneberg said.Simon Manning, who joined World Vision in 2014, said Halabi could also be stubborn professionally. They worked closely on projects, and would spar, including when designing \u201cchild-friendly spaces\u201d for children traumatised by the war. \u201cIt is hilarious, looking back, but I wanted to provide just water for the kids, but he was adamant it should be juice,\u201d Manning said. \u201cWe spent more than a year arguing about it.\u201d Another time at the end of the 2014 war Manning wanted to provide cash to displaced families rather than hygiene kits and food, but Halabi insisted cash was a bad idea as he had worries about the money being stolen. \u201cHe is just a stubborn guy \u2013 with all the positives and negatives that come with that,\u201d Manning said.Megan McGrath, a former World Vision project officer, believes Halabi saved her from an attempted abduction. The two met in the Egyptian Sinai region in 2012, where staff were gathering for meetings. On a day off, a small group decided to go quad biking in the desert, accompanied by two local men. McGrath, who was the only non-Arabic speaker on the trip, describes how Halabi got into a fight with the two guides after he heard them talking about kidnapping her for ransom. One of the would-be kidnappers had a knife. \u201cHe put his life on the line for someone he just met a day earlier,\u201d McGrath said.After that incident, McGrath and Halabi remained friends. During one of her trips to Gaza, around 2013, they were having dinner when the conversation turned to politics. \u201cHe explained to me that a number of his family had been arrested and he felt Hamas was responsible,\u201d McGrath said. \u201cHe was crying. He really despised the [Hamas] leadership.\u201dLenneberg, who worked in Afghanistan during the rise of the Taliban in the 90s, as well as in Pakistan, south-east Asia and elsewhere, during a career spanning three decades, said she had no reason to distrust Halabi. \u201cI am an experienced humanitarian worker. You can tell the staff who are on the take \u2013 their relationship with colleagues and communities is very different. Fear is palpable, the disconnect, the self-interest \u2013 it becomes clear very quickly. That was not Mohammed,\u201d she said.By March 2017, Halabi had been in jail for nine months. The media had long stopped reporting the story, with Donald Trump\u2019s first chaotic months in office gripping global attention. That month, the Australian government completed a review of its funding of World Vision in Gaza \u2013 it had given them $8.1m for Gaza projects between 2014 and 2016, more than 25% of World Vision\u2019s entire Gaza budget, the charity told me. The Australian government concluded that there was no evidence any funds had been diverted. Four months later, the review World Vision had commissioned, from DLA Piper and auditors from Deloitte, was also completed. Its contents have remained classified until now.The two companies conducted a year-long investigation. Between 20 and 30 staff worked full-time, reviewing World Vision\u2019s operations for the five years before Halabi\u2019s arrest. \u201cWe have done a number of other investigations, both corporate and NGO, where we find evidence of malfeasance,\u201d Brett Ingerman, a managing partner with DLA Piper, told me. \u201cWe know what we are looking for, we know the ways that people who are trying to divert funds generally operate.\u201dThe investigators faced obstacles: they could not access Halabi in jail, and the Israeli government refused to provide any documentation or evidence it possessed. They were also blocked by Hamas. On one occasion in 2016, when staff went to the offices of World Vision in Gaza to retrieve documents, Hamas authorities got wind of it and sealed the office off, which seemed suspicious. Ingerman said that, nonetheless, they had \u201cmore than sufficient documentation\u201d to complete their investigation. The team carried out more than 70 interviews, including with former and current World Vision employees, and reviewed 280,000 emails. Deloitte reviewed every payment the organisation made over five years.World Vision were paying for the investigation, but Ingerman insisted there was no interference. \u201cWe were given carte blanche by World Vision to conduct our investigation and follow the evidence wherever it led us,\u201d he said.They found no sign of any missing funds, and no evidence Halabi was working for Hamas \u2013 in fact, they reported that he consistently sought to distance the organisation from them. The closest they found to impropriety were a few times Halabi had slightly overstepped his authority \u2013 signing off a bill for a few hundred dollars more than his limit of $15,000, for example. But they found nothing that could justify any of the Israeli claims. Crucially, they concluded that World Vision\u2019s monitoring and evaluation systems had been robust. \u201cI do NGO investigations in difficult parts of the world \u2026 and I did not see anything out of the ordinary here from a control perspective,\u201d Ingerman said.The audit may also provide an insight into where the Israelis got their initial suspicions of Halabi. A former employee of World Vision had left under a cloud and believed Halabi responsible for his difficulties with the organisation. Kaamil, whose name has been changed to avoid causing problems for his family still in Gaza, worked for World Vision in the strip until 2015. In late May that year he was detained by Hamas, who quizzed him about his work status. He was convinced that Halabi, with whom he had clashed professionally many times, was responsible for his arrest, and that Halabi was trying to force him out of World Vision. In early June, Kaamil sent an email with a series of allegations against Halabi to the organisation\u2019s HR director in Jerusalem.In the email, a copy of which was seen by the Guardian, Kaamil accuses Halabi of corruption for personal gain, and says he had links to Hamas. \u201cThe fact that there was no evidence doesn\u2019t mean that a thing did not happen, it means that the person involved in corruption is smart,\u201d he wrote in the email.Palestinians collect food aid at a distribution centre run by the UNRWA in Gaza City, July 2021. Photograph: Mohammed Abed/AFP/Getty ImagesKaamil left World Vision and left Gaza in 2016, a couple of months before Halabi was arrested. Speaking to me via email, Kaamil said his allegations were sent only to human resources, and insisted he never communicated with the Israelis in any form. He added that his disagreements with Halabi \u201cended with my resignation, and as soon as he was arrested by the (Israeli) occupation. Now he is in a position that deserves support.\u201dWorld Vision now accepts that the allegations were perhaps not dealt with as seriously as they should have been, though Lenneberg said she investigated Kaamil\u2019s allegations after he left the organisation, touring projects in Gaza and meeting with partner organisations. She found no evidence of wrongdoing and said Kaamil provided no financial documents to back up his claims. \u201cIf you say he is taking money, show me where, show me how much,\u201d Lenneberg said. \u201cHe could not give me one shred of evidence.\u201dThe forensic audit by DLA Piper and Deloitte started by investigating Kaamil\u2019s allegations. Ingerman said they found no evidence to support any of the claims.The findings of the audit were sent to World Vision\u2019s management in July 2017. They shared it with key international donors, as well as Halabi\u2019s legal team. It was also offered to Israeli authorities, who declined to view it, World Vision said. In the following months, donors including Australia and Germany quietly reinstated funding, on the basis of the report\u2019s findings. World Vision waited for the Israeli court to drop the charges against Halabi.Acquittals of Palestinians in Israeli courts are rare, so for the accused, going to trial represents a serious risk of a prison sentence. Many of the accused enter into plea deals in which they accept some or all charges in exchange for a reduced sentence. Supporters of the plea system argue that it enables the quicker processing of cases, while critics say it corners Palestinians into confessing to crimes they didn\u2019t commit.\u201cIn some cases [the accused] understand that the chances of being found not guilty are very slim, and the chances of having a fair trial are not high,\u201d Michael Lynk, UN special rapporteur for the Palestinian Territories, told me. \u201cTherefore, to shorten the time and have some certainty regarding when they will get out, they will accept a plea deal, even though they may not be guilty.\u201dMichael Sfard, a prominent Israeli lawyer who has defended many Palestinians, said the Israeli legal system is set up around these deals. \u201cIf Palestinian defendants were to say they were no longer doing plea deals, the system would collapse the next day,\u201d he said.Many plea deals work like that of Waheed al-Borsh, a former UN employee. A week after Halabi was charged, in early August 2016, Israel charged Borsh with working for Hamas. Borsh, who worked at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), was accused of moving 300 tonnes of rubble \u2013 ruins left after Israeli bombing during the 2014 war \u2013 to a specific site near Gaza\u2019s coastline, knowing Hamas would then push it into the sea to build a military jetty. I visited the site in 2016 and found a new-looking jetty, perhaps 10ft wide and extending 50 metres into the sea, with armed Hamas fighters guarding the entrance. UNDP officials privately accepted that rubble dumped from one of its projects may have been used in the construction, but denied any collusion with Hamas. Borsh said the location for dumping the rubble was not his decision.Borsh appointed as his lawyer Lea Tsemel, a Jewish Israeli who has represented hundreds of Palestinians over four decades. A fierce campaigner for Palestinian rights, she has become a hate figure for the Israeli right. In 2019, a documentary about her work, Advocate, won awards at multiple international festivals. Tsemel is a realist. She got to work setting up a deal for Borsh. In January 2017, the most serious charges against her client were dropped. In exchange, he admitted \u201crendering services to an illegal organisation without intention\u201d. He was sentenced to seven months but released immediately with time served. It was a typical plea deal, meaning that everyone got something. The Israelis could still say a UN employee had been convicted of aiding Hamas. Borsh was able to return to his family in Gaza \u2013 though his conviction means he is not allowed to return to work for the UN.\u201cThey confirmed that [I didn\u2019t do anything intentionally] but they took a long time,\u201d Borsh told me in a brief phone call from his home in Gaza. He did not want to discuss the case in further detail. \u201cIt is enough what happened to me.\u201dWaheed al-Borsh, a UN Development Programme employee in Gaza accused of aiding Hamas, speaks to his lawyers at Beersheva district court in 2016. Photograph: Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty ImagesAfter his arrest in 2016, Halabi also appointed Tsemel as his lawyer. I visited her office not long after, but she told me that the legal restrictions on the case meant she was unable to discuss many aspects of it. She feared it was risky to take the case to court \u2013 sentences are increased if you are perceived to have wasted the court\u2019s time \u2013 so she quietly encouraged Halabi to take a deal if one was offered. An Israeli judge also told him in court in March 2017 he had \u201clittle chance\u201d of avoiding conviction. \u201cYou\u2019ve read the numbers and the statistics [of Palestinian convictions],\u201d Judge Nasser Abu Taha told Halabi in court, according to a report from ABC Australia.But Halabi refused. Multiple sources close to World Vision and Halabi said tensions between him and Tsemel grew during his first year in jail. Tsemel argued he was unlikely to get a fair trial and he should make a deal. Halabi said he was willing to pay any price rather than admit something he didn\u2019t do. In the end, Halabi dropped Tsemel in summer 2017, and Maher Hanna, an Arab Israeli from Nazareth, took over. Tsemel said there were no hard feelings, just a difference of opinion.\u201cHe asked me to leave the case because he felt he could make it (without a plea deal). I said alright, go ahead. He was so confident in himself that he went with this (approach). I appreciate it very much that a person feels he can make this war against a very big and heavy power in the security services and police. A lot depends on how much do we trust the courts, how much do we trust the security services to testify the truth,\u201d she said.Hanna said his brief after taking over was simple: fight all the way. \u201c[The prosecution] tried to negotiate about time [length of sentence] but it is irrelevant \u2013 the conflict is about the charge sheet,\u201d Hanna told me in 2018. \u201cMohammed is very clear on that. He is not willing to take anything that charges him with anything related to terror. He is taking the risk that he might, God forbid, be sentenced for a much longer period.\u201dHalabi\u2019s trial took place at the Beersheva district court. Deep in the Negev desert, Beersheva, a city of about 200,000, feels trapped in a perpetual sand storm. In summer, temperatures reach 45C. At the first public session on 12 January 2017, cameramen jostled for a shot of Halabi. He was escorted by two guards. A reporter asked him in Arabic if he had a message for his family. \u201cI want them to know I am OK and I am innocent of all these charges. Our work was purely humanitarian,\u201d he said, looking straight into the journalist\u2019s eyes.Three judges sat raised in front of an Israeli flag, with chief justice Natan Zlotchover flanked by Yael Raz-Levi and Shlomo Friedlander. On days when sensitive evidence was to be discussed, an officer from Shin Bet sat in the back corner of the room guarding boxes full of evidence. Occasionally he was asked to bring a document forward for the defence to see, though they were never allowed to take a copy. At the back sat the few observers, when they were allowed to attend, including some from the UN. World Vision sent colleagues to every session that was open to the public \u2013 although almost all of the hearings related to prosecution evidence were behind closed doors, the UN said.At times the trial appeared to move in slow motion. On average one or two sessions took place a month, but it was not uncommon for a couple of months to pass without one. Sometimes the gaps were due to the defence or prosecution appealing on a particular matter, at others the three judges couldn\u2019t find a time that fitted all their schedules. Halabi\u2019s legal team usually argued sensitive sessions should be open, while the prosecution and security services demanded they be behind closed doors. The state usually won. Most of Halabi\u2019s testimony, including nine days\u2019 worth of cross-examination between June and November 2018, were heard behind closed doors. No transcripts were released. This is unusual, but not unheard of, in Israeli courts, in cases related to security issues. Israel argues other nations, including the UK, have similar laws in terrorism-related cases.Members of Halabi\u2019s family at home in Gaza City. Photograph: APAImages/Rex/ShutterstockShortly before each day\u2019s proceedings began, Halabi would enter flanked by two prison officers, the chains on his feet clinking as he shuffled to a seat behind a plexiglass barrier. He sat for hours focused on the discussions, even though they took place in Hebrew, with the quality of Arabic translation often poor. He would wave to any World Vision staff who came to offer support. One time in 2018 when I was in court he spoke to the World Vision staff briefly before the court was in session, saying, \u201cI must be patient.\u201d He told them he filled his days in jail by teaching English to other prisoners and seeking to de-radicalise inmates who sympathised with Islamic State. \u201cOf the four, I have convinced three,\u201d he said.The case dragged on. At different times **,** chief justice Zlotchover accused the defence and prosecution of sloppy work. Judge Raz-Levi often sat with her head in her hands, looking bored. One of the court-appointed Hebrew-Arabic translators seemed so poor that a Palestinian defence witness under examination barely understood proceedings.Halabi is able to refuse a deal not just because of moral conviction, but also because he has the financial support to do so, with his hefty legal bill being covered by World Vision. Very few Palestinians would be able to afford such principled determination. But the personal toll is high. Halabi\u2019s five children have lived most of their lives without their father. His youngest son, Faris, a baby in 2016, barely knows him. Halabi\u2019s brother Hamed said the children had suffered. \u201cRamadan is the hardest time \u2013 it\u2019s when the family should be together. There have now been six Ramadans where they didn\u2019t have their father.\u201dAt the centre of the case against Halabi is his alleged confession. Back in August 2016, when Shin Bet announced he had confessed, they gave few details, and the truth is still elusive. For several weeks after his arrest, Halabi was prevented from seeing a lawyer. During this time, he was interrogated by Israeli officers, to whom he denied every accusation, his legal team says. He was put in a cell with other Palestinian prisoners, one of whom called himself Abu Ibrahim. This man said he was from Hamas, but Halabi told his lawyers Abu Ibrahim was one of a number of spies Israel has throughout the prison systems, nicknamed _asafeer_ , or \u201csparrows\u201d in Arabic. Abu Ibrahim informed the Israeli authorities that Halabi confessed to him. Much rests on this man\u2019s account, but his testimony was heard behind closed doors.The state argued the confession to Abu Ibrahim was compelling evidence. When placed in a room with a man he thought was a Hamas ally, Halabi had bragged of his role, they said. If the sums of money Israel accused Halabi of stealing were overblown, it was he who had exaggerated. The numbers were not important, what mattered was the confession. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you catch a serial killer, the question of whether he killed 50 people or 25 people is not really relevant is it?\u201d Israel\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Emmanuel Nahshon told ABC News Australia in 2016.A source close to the prosecution insisted the confession was not the only basis of their case, and that clear material evidence was presented to the court during closed sessions. The source also said the prosecution rested in June 2018. The Israeli justice ministry said in a statement that \u201cthe prosecution has agreed to Mr Halabi\u2019s continuous requests for extensions \u2026 which resulted in the dragging out of the proceedings\u201d. Hanna rejected this characterisation of events.Halabi maintains he was beaten up by Israeli interrogators before he was put in a cell with Abu Ibrahim, where he remained for more than a week. The one time I was able to speak to him briefly in court, Halabi said he had hearing problems due to being punched in the head. The Israeli security services deny wrongdoing. The UN human rights body, which sent a lawyer to most public court sessions, has warned that his treatment under interrogation \u201cmay amount to torture\u201d.His lawyer, Hanna, said Halabi told him that, after days trapped in a room with Abu Ibrahim, he could hold out no more, and said whatever the agent wanted him to say. Hanna said Halabi believed the confession was so wild, and the details so clearly unbelievable, that the case would fall apart in court. \u201cHe says he knew Abu Ibrahim was a collaborator,\u201d Hanna said. \u201cFrom the first minute the [police] investigator entered the room, he said: \u2018All I have said I was [forced] to say by Abu Ibrahim. It is all false, you can check it.\u2019\u201dHanna argued that the confession was given under duress, and therefore could not be used in court. After six months going back and forth, in June 2020, the district court ruled with the state: the confession was admissible. With that, Halabi\u2019s hopes of freedom dimmed.## B\u2019Tselem: The battle to be Israel\u2019s conscience | Eve FairbanksIn November 2020, after the trial had dragged on for four and a half years, Michael Lynk and his colleagues \u2013 UN Special Rapporteurs on torture, arbitrary executions and judicial independence \u2013 issued a statement denouncing the trial. \u201cWhat is happening to [Halabi] bears no relation to the trial standards we expect from democracies,\u201d they said. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly disturbing that the prosecution is relying upon confessions allegedly obtained by force while he was denied access to a lawyer, and on testimony from undercover informers.\u201d The Israeli Justice Ministry said that throughout his trial Halabi has received \u201cfull legal rights, including the right to a fair trial, to representation and of appeal to the Supreme Court\u201d.In July 2021, the defence and prosecution summed up their cases. The sessions were completely closed to the public. The judges are expected to take at least three months to deliberate.Mohammed El Halabi has taken an enormous gamble \u2013 that he can win a case in a language he doesn\u2019t speak, in a country where many consider him an enemy. \u201cIf there is any value in the facts, he will be acquitted,\u201d Hanna said. \u201cBut if facts don\u2019t matter, he will go down. We have to believe that the facts matter.\u201d\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here.Support The GuardianAvailable for everyone, funded by readersBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Fluent in 3 months - Language Hacking and Travel TipsUnconventional language hacking tips from Benny the Irish polyglot; travelling the world to learn languages to fluency and beyond!# German Prepositions - The Ultimate Guide (with Charts)by George JulianFull disclosure: This post contains affiliate links. ?German prepositions include words like _bis_ , _mit_ , _\u00fcber_ and _durch_. They\u2019re words that go before a noun (or pronoun) to provide extra information -- usually something about the noun\u2019s position in time or space. Examples of English prepositions include \u201cuntil\u201d, \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cbefore\u201d.What makes German prepositions more complicated than their English counterparts is that you also need to worry about **case**. Every noun and pronoun in German must have one of four _cases_ :- nominative, accusative, dative or genitive. And the case you choose depends on the word\u2019s role within the sentence:  * The **nominative** case denotes the **subject** of the sentence: **_Der Hund_** _ist schwarz_ - \u201cThe dog is black\u201d  * The **accusative** case denotes the **direct object** of the sentence: _Ich sehe **den Hund**_ - \u201cI see the dog\u201d  * The **dative** case denotes the **indirect object** of the sentence: _Ich gab **dem Hund** den Ball_ - \u201cI gave the dog the ball\u201d  * The **genitive** denotes **possession** : _Das ist der Ball **des Hundes**_ - \u201cThat\u2019s the dog\u2019s ball.\u201dDifferent German prepositions take different cases. When using a German preposition, you must use the correct case for the noun that follows:  * _Ich bin **mit meiner** Frau_ - \u201cI\u2019m with my wife\u201d  *  _Es ist **f\u00fcr meine** Frau_ - \u201cIt\u2019s for my wife\u201dTo make matters more complicated, some German prepositions, such as \u201ctwo-way prepositions\u201d, can take either an accusative or dative noun for different meanings.I\u2019ll explain everything below. This article is a comprehensive guide to all the German prepositions, their meanings, the cases they take, and their subtleties. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ll talk about:  * German Prepositions Can\u2019t Always Be Translated Word-for-Word.  * What\u2019s the Difference Between Wegen and Weil in German?  * German Prepositions and Motion - an, auf, in, nach, zu.  * German Prepositions to Describe Position or LocationAs you can see, we\u2019ll cover everything you need to know about German prepositions, as well as related topics like telling the time in German, and the so-called \u201cseparable verbs\u201d.## German Prepositions Can\u2019t Always Be Translated Word-for-Word.Below, I\u2019ll introduce lots of German prepositions and tell you their English meanings.But be careful with your translations! German and English prepositions don\u2019t have a one-to-one correspondence, and there are various idiomatic uses you need to be aware of.First of all, just because a German preposition looks like an English preposition, doesn\u2019t mean that they have the exact same meaning.The German _bei_ sounds just like the English \u201cby\u201d, but it\u2019s not always translated that way. _Ich wohne bei meiner Tante_ means \u201cI live **with** my aunt\u201d. It would be very unnatural to translate _bei_ as \u201cby\u201d in this instance.And there are many more subtleties to watch out for.In English, we say that a TV show is \u201c **on** \u201d the television. If you translated this directly into German, you might ask _was ist auf dem Fernsehen?_ \u2026But this doesn\u2019t mean \u201cwhat show is on television?\u201d In fact, you\u2019re asking what\u2019s physically on top of the television set. Instead you must ask \u201cwas ist **im** Fernsehen?\u201d (\u201cWhat\u2019s _in_ the TV?\u201d).\u201cCinema\u201d in German is _Kino_ , a neutral noun. (Like in English, the word can refer to both a physical movie theatre and to the general concept of cinema as an industry or artform.)When inviting your German friend to see a movie, you might be tempted to translate literally from English and ask if they want to _zur Kino_ (\u201c _to_ the cinema\u201d). But the correct German expression is _ins Kino_ (\u201cinto the cinema\u201d).Let me give you one last example. In English, we describe writing and utterances as being _in_ a particular language: \u201cthe book is in English.\u201d But in German, you can\u2019t say _das Buch ist in_ Englisch _. You must say das Buch ist **auf** Englisch_ (\u201cthe book is **on** English\u201d).There are many more examples like this. By all means, learn the English translations of German prepositions as given below, but pay attention to how they\u2019re used in context. Don\u2019t assume that you can always translate a given German preposition with the same English word every time.The following German prepositions always take an accusative:  * _bis_ - \u201cuntil, up to, as far as\u201d  *  _durch_ - \u201cthrough, by means of\u201dHere are some examples. Note how the bolded nouns or pronouns are accusative.  * _Er kocht f\u00fcr **die Kinder**._ - \u201cHe cooks for the children.\u201d  *  _Sie geht durch **den Wald**._ - \u201cShe walks through the forest.\u201d  *  _Wir spielen **ohne dich**._ - \u201cWe are playing without you.\u201d  *  _Wir laufen um **das Haus**._ - \u201cWe run around the house.\u201d\u201cWithout\u201d or \u201cwith no\u201d should **always** be translated as _ohne_ , never _mit kein_.  * _Ein Huhn ohne Kopf,_ - \u201cA chicken with no head,\u201d (not _mit kein Kopf_ )_Entlang_ is unusual in that it goes after the noun, not before. Technically, this makes _entlang_ a **postposition** , not a preposition.  * **_die Stra\u00dfe_** _entlang_ - \u201cdown the street\u201d  *  ** _den Fluss_** _entlang_ - \u201calong the river\u201dAlthough if we want the whole story, it\u2019s not strictly wrong to put _entlang_ before the noun. If it\u2019s before the noun, the noun should be dative (which makes _entlang_ doubly weird):_Um_ can also be used with _zu_ to link two clauses together, meaning \u201cin order to\u201d.  * _Ich rufe Jonas an, **um** ihm eine Frage **zu** stellen_ - \u201cI\u2019m calling Jonas (in order) to ask him a question.\u201dThe following German prepositions always take a dative:  *  _bei_ - \u201cat, near, at the house of\u201d  * _Geh mir **aus dem** Weg!_ - \u201cGet out of the way!\u201d  *  _Ich wohne **bei meinem** Freund._ - \u201cI live with my boyfriend.\u201d  *  ** _Nach dem_** _Unterricht treffen wir._ - \u201cWe\u2019re meeting after (the) class.\u201d  *  _Ich habe es **von meinem** Bruder geh\u00f6rt._ - \u201cI heard it from my brother.\u201d  *  _Wir gehen **zum** Festival._ - \u201cWe\u2019re going to the festival.\u201d  *  _Alle **au\u00dfer ihm** gab mir ein Geschenk._ - \u201cEveryone but him gave me a gift.\u201dWhen using _seit_ to mean \u201csince\u201d, remember that some time expressions use a different phrasing in German to how we\u2019d say it in English.  * _Ich bin hier **seit einem** Jahr_ - \u201cI\u2019ve been here for a year,\u201d (literally: \u201cI am here since one year.\u201d)_Gegen\u00fcber_ and _zufolge_ are postpositions. In other words, they\u2019re supposed to go after the noun.  * _Er wohnt **der** Schule **gegen\u00fcber**._ - \u201cHe lives opposite the school.\u201d  *  ** _Dem_** _Unternehmen **zufolge** war die Beschr\u00e4nkung nicht bindend._ - \u201cAccording to the company, the restriction was not binding.\u201dHowever, in modern German speech it\u2019s common to put _gegen\u00fcber_ before the noun, optionally followed by _von_. So the above example can also be said as _er wohnt **gegen\u00fcber (von)** der Schule_.The preposition _zu_ can be used with an adjective to mean \u201ctoo\u201d, as in \u201ctoo much\u201d.  * _Es ist zu lange_ - \u201cIt\u2019s too long.\u201dThe trickiest German prepositions are the _Wechselpr\u00e4positionen_ ,also known as the \u201ctwo-way prepositions\u201d. They\u2019re sometimes also called the \u201cdual case prepositions\u201d.These prepositions can take the dative _or_ accusative:  * _an_ - \u201con (a vertical surface)\u201d  *  _auf_ - \u201con top of (horizontal surface)\u201dThat\u2019s a lot to take in, but this image can help you visualise it:So when should you use the dative and when should you use the accusative? The difference is this:  * Use the **dative** to describe a **static position**.  * Use the **accusative** to describe a **change in position**.  * _Ich setze den Stift auf **den** Tisch._ - \u201cI put the pen on the table.\u201d (accusative)  *  _Der Stift steht auf **dem** Tisch._ - \u201cThe pen is on the table.\u201d (dative)  * _Ich stecke die Schuhe unter **das** Bett._ - \u201cI put the shoes under the bed.\u201d (accusative)  *  _Die Schuhe sind unter **dem** Bett._ - \u201cThe shoes are under the bed.\u201d (dative) Do you see the difference? In the dative examples, the pen and shoes are stationary. In the accusative examples, their position changed as a result of the action described.Be careful: just because the thing you\u2019re talking about is _moving_ , that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s undergone a _change in position_.The question isn\u2019t \u201cdid the object move at all?\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cdid it change its position _relative to the word with the preposition_?\u201dCompare these two sentences:  * _Die Kinder sind **im** Garten gelaufen._ - \u201cThe children ran in the garden.\u201d (dative)  *  _Die Kinder sind **in den** Garten gelaufen._ - \u201cThe children ran into the garden\u201d. (accustive)( _Im_ , as we\u2019ll see below, is a contraction of the preposition _in_ and the dative article _dem_.)In both of these examples, the _Kinder_ are moving. However, in the first example, they start and finish inside the garden, so their position relative to the garden didn\u2019t change - so we use the dative. In the second example, they started outside the garden and finished inside it, so we must use the accusative.Remember, this rule **only** applies to the two-way prepositions. If the preposition appeared on the earlier lists of accusative and dative prepositions, it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not there\u2019s change in position: the preposition can only be followed by one case.  * _Sie geht zum Arzt_ - \u201cShe goes to the doctor\u201d. This sentence arguably involves a change in position, but _zu_ isn\u2019t a two-way preposition, so we have to use the dative _zu der_ (which gets contracted to _zur_.  *  _Ich singe ein Lied f\u00fcr dich_ - \u201cI sing a song for you\u201d. There\u2019s no motion or change of position here, but _f\u00fcr_ must be followed by an accusative.When _\u00fcber_ means \u201cabout\u201d (as opposed to \u201cabove\u201d or \u201cover\u201d), it\u2019s always followed by an accusative.  * _Jeder spricht **\u00fcber ihn**_ - \u201cEveryone is talking about him\u201d.This page has some more examples of how to use the two-way prepositions, plus some exercises so you can make sure you really understand the difference.The final category of German prepositions are the _genitive prepositions_.  * _anstatt_ (often abbreviated to just _statt_ ) - \"instead [of]\"  *  _jenseits_ - \"on the other side\"Generally, but not always, prepositions whose English translations end in \u201cto\u201d (like _dank_ - \u201cthanks to\u201d and _gem\u00e4\u00df_ - \u201caccording to\u201d) take the dative, while prepositions whose English translations end in \u201cof\u201d (like _innerhalb_ , \"inside of\") should take the genitive.I say they _should_ take the genitive but, in practice, they often don\u2019t. The genitive case is falling out of use in modern German. Where the formal rules dictate that the genitive should be used, it\u2019s very common to ignore the rules and use a dative instead.This is illustrated by the famous German saying _der Dativ ist dem Genitiv sein Tod_ (\u201cthe dative is the death of the genitive\u201d)For example, _w\u00e4hrend des Essens_ is the \u201ccorrect\u201d way to say \u201cduring the meal.\u201d But it\u2019s very common in everyday speech to say _w\u00e4hrend dem Essen_._Der Laden ist **wegen Urlaubs** geschlossen_ means \u201cthe shop is closed because of / due to the holidays _. Note how Urlaub_ here has the genitive form _Urlaubs_. But you could get away with the \u201cincorrect\u201d _der Laden ist wegen Urlaubs_ _geschlossen_.Don\u2019t neglect the genitive if you\u2019re, say, sitting an exam or writing a formal document. But replacing it with a dative can make your speech sound more colloquial and natural.Disclaimer: prepositions that end with _-halb_ and _-seits_ **can\u2019t** be used with the dative, even in informal speech. For these prepositions you must always use genitive.  * _Seine Wohnung liegt **au\u00dferhalb** des Stadtkerns._ - \u201cHis apartment is located outside of the city center.\u201d  *  _Es kam **innerhalb** der Partei zu Spannungen._ - \u201cThere were tensions within the party.\u201d## What\u2019s the Difference Between _Wegen_ and _Weil_ in German?I just told you that the preposition _wegen_ means \u201cbecause of\u201d. But you\u2019re probably also familiar with the words _weil_ which means \u201cbecause\u201d. What\u2019s the difference?_Weil_ is a **conjunction** , not a preposition. _Wegen_ is followed by a noun or pronoun, but _weil_ is followed by an _entire clause_ which explains the reason for the thing being described.  * **_Wegen_** _meiner Krankheit konnte ich meine Hausaufgaben nicht machen._ - \u201cBecause of my illness, I couldn\u2019t do my homework.\u201d  *  ** _Weil_** _ich krank war, konnte ich meine Hausaufgaben nicht machen._ - \u201cBecause I was ill, I couldn\u2019t do my homework.  *  ** _Wegen_** _des schlechten Wetters, bleiben wir zu Hause._ - \u201cBecause of the bad weather, we\u2019re staying at home.\u201d  *  ** _Weil_** _das Wetter schlecht ist, bleiben wir zu Hause._ - \u201cBecause the weather is bad, we\u2019re staying at home.\u201dAs explained above, _wegen des schlechten Wetters_ in the above example can be replaced in everyday speech with the dative _wegen dem schlechten Wetter_.On the other hand, this doesn\u2019t matter for _wegen meiner Krankheit_ , because _Krankheit_ is a feminine noun, therefore its dative and genitive forms are identical anyway.Earlier, I mentioned how the German word _im_ is a contraction of the preposition _in_ and the article _dem_. It\u2019s like how in English we usually say \u201cI\u2019m\u201d instead of \u201cI am\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re\u201d instead of \u201cthey are\u201d.German has loads of these **preposition + definite article** contractions. Almost all of them involve the articles _das_ (neuter accusative) or _dem_ (masculine or neuter dative), although one involves _der_ (feminine dative).The full list of German prepositional contractions is here:preposition | article | contraction  an | das | ans  an | dem | am  auf | das | aufs  bei | dem | beim  durch | das | durchs  f\u00fcr | das | f\u00fcrs  in | das | ins  in | dem | im  \u00fcber | das | \u00fcbers  um | das | ums  unter | das | unters  von | dem | vom  vor | das | vors  vor | dem | vorm  zu | dem | zum  zu | der | zur  ## German Prepositions and Motion - _an_ , _auf_ , _in_ , _nach_ , _zu_.When describing movement or motion, there are various prepositions you could use.Use _nach_ for countries, continents, islands, cities, and towns:  * _Ich reise nach Deutschland / nach Europa / nach Berlin / nach Sizilien._ - \u201cI am traveling to Germany / Europe / Berlin / Sicily.\u201dFor countries with a \u201cthe\u201d in their name, use _in_. (Note that some countries have an article in their German name even when they don\u2019t have one in their English name.)  * _Ich reise in die Schweiz / in die USA / in den Irak / in die T\u00fcrkei._ - \u201cI am traveling to Switzerland / USA / Iraq / Turkey.\u201dYou should also use _nach_ with directions:  * _nach links_ - \u201cto the left\u201d  *  _nach rechts_ - \u201cto the right\u201d  *  _nach Norden/S\u00fcden/Osten/Westen_ - \u201cto the north/south/east/west\u201d_Nach Hause_ means \u201c(to) home\u201d, e.g.:  * _Sie sind noch nicht zur\u00fcck **nach Hause** gekommen._ - \u201cShe hasn\u2019t come home yet.\u201dUse _in_ if the movement will take you _inside_ the destination:  * _Ich gehe ins Kino_ (\u201ccinema\u201d) _in die Klasse_ (\u201cclass\u201d) / _in die Kirche_ (\u201cchurch\u201d) / _in den Park_ (\u201cpark\u201d) / _in die Stadt_ (\u201ccity\u201d)But use _zu_ if it wouldn\u2019t make sense to go inside, e.g. \u201cdriving to the airport\u201d. You should also use _zu_ if you\u2019re going to the premises of a company or institution that you mention by name, e.g. _zu Aldi_ , _zu Walmart_.Use _auf_ if you\u2019ll end up on top of something:  * _Ich klettere auf den Berg_ - \u201cI climb up the mountain.\u201d  *  _Die Kuh geht auf die Weide_ - \u201cThe cow goes into/onto the meadow.\u201d_Auf_ can also be used when going to an event or public places:_Ich gehe auf die Party / die Hochzeit_ (\u201cwedding\u201d) / _auf die Post_ (\u201cpost office\u201d) / _auf den Markt_ (\u201cmarketplace\u201d)Although you can use _zu_ in these cases, and sometimes _zu_ is more common:_Ich gehe zum Rathaus_ (\u201ctown hall\u201d) / _zur Universit\u00e4t_ (\u201cuniversity\u201d) / _zur Bibliothek_ (\u201clibrary\u201d)When describing motion to a precise spot, use _an_ :_Ich gehe ans Mikrofon_ (\u201cmicrophone\u201d) / _an die Bushaltestelle_ (\u201cbus stop\u201d) / _an den Strand_ (\u201cbeach\u201d).Generally, if you can stand \u201cat\u201d or \u201cby\u201d something in English, then it makes sense to use _an_ to describe motion towards it in German:_Ich gehe an die Grenze_ (\u201cborder\u201d) / _an den Fluss_ (\u201criver\u201d) / _an die Front_ (\u201cfront\u201d, as in a war)## German Prepositions to Describe Position or LocationThe previous section explained which preposition to choose when describing motion towards an object.What about static position? That is, what preposition should you use to describe where something _is_ , rather than where it\u2019s _going_?_In_ , _auf_ and _an_ can be used to describe a static position in exactly the same contexts as described above for motion.  * _Ich bin im Kino / in der Klasse / in der Kirche / im Park / in der Stadt._ - \u201cI'm in the cinema / in class / in church / in the park / in town.\u201d  *  _Die Kuh ist auf der Weide._ - \u201cThe cow is in the meadow.\u201d  *  _Er ist am Fluss / an der Front_ - \u201cHe's on the river / at the front.\u201dDid you notice how in these examples the nouns are dative, but in the previous section they were accusative? If you read the section about German two-way prepositions, you should understand why the case has changed.You can use _auf_ to describe location in public buildings, but _in_ and _an_ are increasingly used instead:  * _Ich bin in der Post / im Rathaus / in der Bibliothek / am Bahnhof / an der Universit\u00e4t__An_ usually indicates location at or in a place. _Bei_ can be used to, although it implies a vaguer location; it\u2019s more like \u201cnearby\u201d or \u201cin the vicinity of\u201d._Ich bin am/beim Bahnhof, am/beim Supermarkt.__Zu_ usually indicates motion, not location, but it indicates location in a few set phrases, like _zu Hause_ (\u201cat home\u201d) and _zu Tisch_ (\u201con the table\u201d)._Nach_ always indicates motion, not position. Use _in_ to describe location in/on continents, countries (including countries with a \u201cthe\u201d in their name\u201d), cities and towns:_Ich bin in Deutschland / in Europa / in der USA / in Berlin._Use _auf_ to describe position on an island:_Napoleon war auf Elba._ - \u201cNapoleon was on Elba.\u201d_Bei_ can mean \u201cat the house/home of\u201d, or \u201con the premises of (a company, organisation)\u201d. You can also use it with your place of work:  * _Wir sind bei Benny._ - \u201cWe\u2019re at Benny\u2019s house.\u201d  *  _Er ist beim Metzger._ - \u201cHe\u2019s at the butcher\u2019s.\u201d  *  _Ich arbeite bei Siemens._ - \u201cI work for Siemens.\u201dThe German prepositions _an_ , _in_ and _um_ are used in various expressions about time and date.Why use three different prepositions? Well, why in English do we say \u201c _on_ Monday\u201d, \u201c _at_ 7pm\u201d and \u201c _in_ February\u201d? I\u2019m not sure, but you need to remember the rules.Use _am_ (which, as we just saw, is a contraction of _an_ and _dem_ ) for days of the week and dates:  *  _am ersten Mai_ - \u201con May 1st\u201dUse _um_ to talk about a specific time of day:  * _um sechs Uhr_ - \u201cat 6 o\u2019clock\u201d  *  _um zwanzig Uhr_ - \u201cat 8pm\u201d  *  _um halb zwei_ - \u201cat 1.30pm\u201dIn German, a time like _halb zwei_ - \u201chalf two\u201d - means \u201chalf an hour _before_ two\u201d, i.e. half past one. This is in contrast to British English, where \u201chalf two\u201d means \u201chalf _past_ two\u201d.German doesn\u2019t have words for A.M. and P.M.. _Um drei Uhr_ can mean \u201cat 3am\u201d or \u201cat 3pm\u201d. I you want to be specific you can say _um drei Uhr morgens_ (\u201cat three in the morning\u201d) or _um drei Uhr nachmittags_ (\u201cat three in the evening\u201d).Alternatively, you can use the 24-hour clock. It\u2019s common in German to say things like _um f\u00fcnfzehn Uhr_ (\u201cat fifteen o\u2019clock\u201d) which isn\u2019t something we say in English._Gegen_ , when used with a time expression, means \u201caround\u201d:  * _K\u00f6nnen wir uns **gegen** 13:00 Uhr treffen?_ - \u201cCan we meet at around 1pm?\u201dFor non-precise times of day, use _am_ , with one exception:  * _am Morgen_ - \u201cin the early morning.\u201d  *  _am Vormittag_ - \u201cin the morning.\u201d  *  _am Nachmittag_ - \u201cin the afternoon.\u201d  *  _am Abend_ - \u201cin the evening.\u201d  *  _in der Nacht_ - \u201cin the night / at nighttime.\u201dGerman has two words for \u201cmorning\u201d. _Morgen_ - which can also mean \u201ctomorrow\u201d - is the early morning, from midnight until roughly the start of the workday. _Vormittag_ , which literally means \u201cbefore noon\u201d, starts when the _Morgen_ ends, and ends at midday. See here for a more detailed explanation.Use _im_ with seasons and months:Years don\u2019t require a preposition at all in German:  * _Angela Merkel wurde 1954 geboren._ - \u201cAngela Merkel was born in 1954.\u201dBut you can make your sentence meatier by adding _im Jahre_ (\u201cin the year\u201d):  * _Angela Merkel wurde im Jahre 1954 geboren._ - \u201cAngela Merkel was born in the year 1954.\u201dGerman prepositions can be followed by a pronoun:\u2026 but this is **only** possible when the pronoun refers to a **person** , not an inanimate object.Remember that masculine and feminine pronouns in German can refer to inanimate objects if the word for that object is a masculine or feminine noun. This differs from English, where the masculine and feminine pronouns \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d can only refer to people, while inanimate objects are always referred to by the neutral pronoun \u201cit.When referring to inanimate objects, German uses something called a \u201cprepositional adverb\u201d. This is where you put the prefix _da-_ in front of the preposition, or _dar-_ if the preposition starts with a vowel. So for example _f\u00fcr_ becomes _daf\u00fcr_ , and _auf_ becomes _darauf_.Prepositional adverbs are often translated in English using \u201cit\u201d. So for example, _daf\u00fcr_ means \u201cfor it\u201d.  * _Ich fliege Morgen nach Frankreich, aber mein Boss wei\u00df nichts **davon**._ - \u201cTomorrow I\u2019m flying to France, but my boss knows nothing **about it**.\u201d  *  _Er hat einen Bleistift. Er schreibt **damit**._ - \u201cHe has a pencil. He writes **with it**.\u201dThe _da-_ can also refer to an entire sentence, concept, action or idea.  * _Er sprang von der Mauer, und **dabei** brach er das Bein._ - \u201cHe jumped from the wall, and **thereby** he broke his leg.\u201d Possible translations for _dabei_ here include \u201cthereby\u201d, \u201cin the process\u201d, or \u201cin doing so\u201d.  *  _Ich warte **darauf** , dass sie das Haus verkauft haben._ - \u201cI\u2019m waiting for them to have sold the house.\u201dOn first encounter, these da-compounds can sound weird to an English speaker._Daf\u00fcr_ feels like an inversion of the English word order, saying \u201cit-for\u201d instead of \u201cfor it\u201d. But when you think about it (er, or when you think _dar\u00fcber_ ), English actually has a lot of words which _do_ follow this inverted pattern. It\u2019s just that most of them are quite old-timey: _therefore_ , _therein_ , _thereby_ , _thereto_ , _thereunder_.These English words can\u2019t always be used as an exact translation for the German prepositional adverbs they resemble. But when you remember that they exist, it can make their German cousins feel less \u201cforeign\u201d and easier to wrap your head around.As well as the above \u201cda-\u201d words, German prepositions can also be combined with the prefixes _hier-_ (\u201chere\u201d) and _wo-_ (\u201cwhere\u201d, \u201cwhich\u201d, \u201cwhat\u201d), or _wor-_ before a vowel. These compounds also have archaic English relatives, like \u201chereby\u201d, \u201chereto\u201d and \u201cwherefore\u201d.  * **_Hiermit_** _schlie\u00dfen wir diese \u00dcbung._ - \u201cWith this we end this exercise.\u201d  *  ** _Hierzu_** _brauchen wir viel Geld._ - \u201cTo do that we need a lot of money.\u201d  *  _Das Haus, **worin** ich wohne, ist neu._ - \u201cThe house in which I live is new.\u201d  *  _Der Stuhl, **worauf** sie steht, ist unsicher._ - \u201cThe chair on which she is standing is unsafe.\u201d_Wo-_ compounds can also be used to ask \u201cwhat?\u201d questions:  * **_Womit_** _schreibst du?_ - \u201cWhat are you writing with?\u201d  *  ** _Worauf_** _stehen Sie?_ - \u201cWhat are you standing on?\u201dGerman has loads of idiomatic expressions which use prepositions or prepositional adverbs. Here are some of the most useful ones to know:  * **_Beim_** _besten Willen nicht._ - \"Not by any stretch of the imagination.\"  *  _Es kommt **darauf** an._ - \"It depends.\"  *  _H\u00f6r auf **damit**!_ - \"Stop it!\"  *  _Ich bin **damit** einverstanden._ - \"I agree.\"  *  _Ich halte nicht viel **davon**._ - \"I don\u2019t think much of that.\"  *  _Keine Spur **davon**._ - \"No sign of it.\"  *  ** _Mit_** _Waschbrettbauch_ - \"Ripped\", \"With washboard abs.\"  *  ** _Zum_** _beispiel_ - \"For example\"  *  ** _Zum_** _Wohl!_ - \u201cBless you!\u201d (when someone sneezes). Also \"Cheers\", i.e. a toast when drinking, although this is quite formal; _Prost_ is a more common toast.Look at the following German sentences. They appear to contain prepositions:  * _Ich stehe um 7 Uhr **auf**._ - \u201cI get up at 7 o\u2019clock.\u201d  *  _Wir sprechen den Preis **ab**._ - \u201cWe agree on the price.\u201d  *  _Ich gehe mit meinen Freunden jeden Tag **aus**._ - \u201cI go out with my friends every day.\u201dThese sentences look a bit weird, given everything we\u2019ve covered above. You\u2019ve learnt the prepositions _auf_ , _ab_ , and _aus_ , but in these cases they\u2019re not followed by any noun at all, let alone a noun in a particular case.In fact, these sentences all contain examples of German **separable verbs** ( _trennbare Verben_ ). They\u2019re a complicated topic which deserve an entire post of their own. But for the sake of completeness, I\u2019ll give a brief introduction here so you don\u2019t get confused by these stray prepositions.Let\u2019s forget about German for a second.In English we have this category of verbs called \u201cphrasal verbs\u201d. This is when we combine a verb with another word - usually a preposition - to get a new term that often means something very different from the original verb.For example, \u201cto give up\u201d means \u201cto surrender\u201d or \u201cto stop trying\u201d - a very different meaning from \u201cto give\u201d.There are many verbs in German which combine a shorter verb and a preposition like this. For example, you can combine _sprechen_ (\u201cto speak\u201d) and _ab_ (\u201cfrom/off\u201d), to get a verb meaning \u201cto agree\u201d, which we saw above.The difference from English is that, in the infinitive, you put the preposition _before_ the main verb and write it as a single word: _absprechen_. Only in certain grammatical forms do you split the _ab_ off and place it elsewhere in the sentence: _wir sprechen ab_. That\u2019s why they\u2019re called **separable** verbs.Not every separable verb has a prefix which looks like one of the prepositions we\u2019ve seen. For example, _einkaufen_ (\u201cto buy\u201d) is a separable verb, as in _ich kaufe einen Apfel ein_ (\u201cI buy an apple\u201d), but _ein_ isn\u2019t a preposition.But many separable verbs do use a preposition as their prefix. Just look at some of these variations of the verb _kommen_ (\u201cto come\u201d).There\u2019s much more that could be said about separable verbs, but I\u2019ll save it for another article. For now, just remember that when you see a word like _mit_ or _aus_ , it could be part of a separable verb, rather than a preposition in the usual sense.We\u2019ve covered a lot of ground! If you\u2019re not exhausted yet, I\u2019ll leave you with the following German _Zungenbrecher_ (tongue twister):_In Ulm und um Ulm und um Ulm herum._Ulm is a city in Bavaria. Can you figure out what the whole sentence means?If you\u2019re studying German grammar, maybe you\u2019re interested in reading about German articles. Or maybe you\u2019d like to take a break from it with something less challenging, like this list of great German TV shows for German learners.Additionally, Benny Lewis, founder of _Fluent in 3 Months_ , has put together a masterlist of the best resources to learn German that you can take advantage of.Benny\u2019s recommendations include some of the _Fi3M_ team\u2019s favourites, like the German Uncovered course by Olly Richards.Good luck with your German learning, and don\u2019t forget: _Fi3M_ German post category\u2019s got your back!Content Writer, Fluent in 3 MonthsSpeaks: English, French, Spanish, German, Vietnamese, PortugueseGeorge is a polyglot, linguistics nerd and travel enthusiast from the U.K. He speaks four languages and has dabbled in another five, and has been to more than forty countries.

This marketing approach enables businesses to bring to their brands a distinct method to continuously optimize their customers' experiencesComposable commerce leverages multiple best-of-breed vendors composed together into a complete, business-ready solution. This development strategy mashes selected commerce components and combines them into a custom application built for specific business needs using Packaged Business Capabilities (PBCs).Companies with a composable tech solution will be 80 percent faster than their competitors when implementing new features by 2023, according to Gartner research. This marketing strategy is much like a symphony.Consider that symphonic structure divides the musical score into parts or movements. Each one takes the listener on a journey. In the same way, the composable commerce strategy is a modern-day commerce solution built around the customer journey. It requires a host of parts or building blocks -- such as CMS, ERP, search, relevance, live video shopping, and checkout.It is up to businesses to select and orchestrate these components to deliver the right functionality to support ongoing needs. This is where composable commerce comes into play. It enables organizations to construct an e-commerce solution with separate interchangeable building blocks to adapt to customer needs that are always evolving.Increasingly, commerce organizations are leveraging this approach to improve agility and flexibility. Composable commerce is one of the retail industry's newest tools to help companies meet the sharp increase of digital commerce traffic during the Covid-19 pandemic.\"In a nutshell, composable commerce is the ability to implement your digital commerce solution in a best-of-breed manner. The other side of the spectrum is monolith solutions, which have everything included,\" Johan Liljeros, general manager North America and senior commerce advisor for digital commerce firm Avensia, told the E-Commerce Times.Think of the composable commerce system as a new type of marketing platform. You adapt its functionality to fit your business needs, rather than adapting your business flow to match what the monolith system offers.For instance, you pick your CMS, the payments processing solution, and the kind of search engine. You select the type of personalization, the hosting provider, and your commerce orchestration for check out, digital asset management, and so forth.All those selected components will integrate like a modular jigsaw puzzle into whatever distribution resource planning (DRP) or CRM platform you use, Liljeros noted.The initial cost to set up a composable platform is usually a little bit higher. But the long-term gains are much higher as well, according to Liljeros.\"You might have to invest a little bit more initially to integrate all these components, but you also get a much longer life expectancy from the platform, which you can adapt much easier,\" he added.That continuing adaptability can pay off in cases where a company's business model or its customer experience changes. As expectations change, you can modify a composable platform much faster, which will save you both time, money, and losses to competition.\"When it comes to competition, that would be the other business value in this, not only investment but the competition. I would say, you will drastically increase your chances to outperform the competition, implementing new solutions,\" Liljeros said.Liljeros cautioned that potential adopters need to view composable commerce platforms as a broad-based tool rather than a solution for certain industries. It is not about being a tool for a business-to-business or a business-to-consumer company. Rather, he said, it is more about how much flexibility will you need in the future and how quickly do you want to be to adapt to industry changes.Instead, business leaders need to look at parameters like a company's customer-facing requirements. How will customer requirements and expectations change over time? Will business leaders implement new business models, or will their industry require more flexibility in the business models moving forward?Also, consider how a company's value proposition will change over the next five years. What is the digital strategy, and, what will the IT landscape force require?Thus, the industries a business targets are going to determine the range of modules its leaders will select to plug into the commerce platform, Liljeros agreed.Right now, composable commerce platforms are in an adaption curve, he noted. Its growth curve as a business tool has been around for the last few years.As with all new technology, it can take some time for companies and governments to understand its true value. Meanwhile, founders of this technology continue to develop different platforms to develop their solutions.\"The concept of best of breed is not new. But it is now in a totally different way that the technology is so much further ahead to help it be more profitable and beneficial,\" Liljeros said.Avensia, like numerous other digital development firms, is on the ground floor of this new technology. The company delivers e-commerce solutions to retailers and business companies around the world.Ground floor involvement, yes, but not a new business start-up. Avensia has been involved in commerce platforms for 14 years, working with bringing platforms that put all these components together and adapt them for clients' needs.Avensia works with do-it-yourself companies, retailers, and manufacturers to help them select different platform components and glue together integrations between e-commerce orchestration platforms, explained Liljeros.Part of this growing trend of plug-in or composable business modules for commerce platforms is a morphing of terminology. For instance, Liljeros rarely uses the term \"e-commerce\" because doing so reinforces a divide between brick-and-motor retail stores and traditional e-commerce businesses.Instead, he refers to a more inclusive \"digital commerce\" term. The so-called e-commerce is becoming an integral part of in-store commerce, he offered.In a broader sense, composable commerce solutions are technologies now found in physical stores as well. It could be the digital displays used for self-checkout, or the POS system, and so forth that reuse the same technology.\"We use different components in the stores as well,\" he said. \"Product information displays or personalization effects in the physical store can be exactly the same information that you use with online system services.\"The good thing about this, he added, is when you look at the results from a customer perspective. Different channels no longer exist. For customers, it becomes more of a coherent experience.\"If you are met by the same wording, the same pricing, the same campaigns, and the same offerings in every channel, you get a channel-agnostic experience which all retailers are looking forward to. This way of building a commerce system achieves making it easier to connect new channels to the system. That makes sense,\" observed Liljeros.**Jack M.

Because the answer to the same question evolves over time. To choose a culinary metaphor, consider the answer to the question \u201cHow long will it take to heat last night\u2019s leftovers?\u201d In the 1950s, the answer was \u201cMaybe twenty minutes in the oven.\u201d In the 1980s, the answer was \u201cThree minutes in the microwave.\u201d Today, the answer is \u201cLeftovers? I buy single-serve containers so I have no leftovers!\u201dSmart business owners, therefore, not only know the key questions, but they know to keep asking them. Here are the top 5 questions professionals hear from their business owner clients (and the answers they provide them).## #1: \u201cCan I handle the growth I want?\u201dRegardless of your age or how long you\u2019ve been in business, you know you won\u2019t stay in business if you don\u2019t continue to grow. Perhaps the best way to accomplish this is to think holistically. Your business is not your life, however, it acts as a means to give you the life you want. It therefore must be integrated into your life.Brian Haney, Founder and Vice President of The Haney Company in Silver Spring, Maryland, says, \u201cWhile the questions come in different shapes and sizes, the underlying theme they all roll up to is: \u2018How do I maximize profitability for myself both now and for my future?\u2019 My answer to that is: By developing a strategy to protect your revenues, allocate them in the most tax efficient way possible, and then deploying them into the right financial instruments to optimally support your lifestyle, especially when you stop working.\u201d## #2: \u201cCan I do everything myself or should I hire an expert (Can I get by with one expert or is it better to hire several)?\u201dSpeaking of integration, you\u2019ll need to decide to what extent you\u2019re willing to delegate certain activities. Remember, if you want to grow, you need to focus on the critical tasks. Other areas, while often critical to your success but in an incidental way, can become obstacles to success if they consume you.MORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR### Who Is The New Platinum Card From American Express Good For?\u201cThe most common question or concern we get from business owners is about integration,\u201d says Matt Ruttenberg, Chief Marketing Officer and Director of Participant Education for Life, Inc. Retirement Services in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cIntegration these days is vital when running a company. Most often, there isn\u2019t an HR rep involved any longer, just one person handling everything from payroll to client\u2019s orders. Integration is easy these days. Most payroll providers have integrations with most 401k record keepers, even Quickbooks these days. If your #1 concern is integration, you don\u2019t have to stick with the payroll provider\u2019s bundled programs any longer.\u201d## #3: \u201cHow do I reduce my taxes and does any tax savings offset the costs of that tax reduction?\u201dHarking back to Haney\u2019s comment on \u201cthe most tax efficient way possible,\u201d this applies to all areas of your life and business. It\u2019s one of those peripheral areas where hiring a professional (a tax advisor) becomes the obvious choice.When he\u2019s asked \u201cHow can I best utilize the tools available by the IRS and current regulations to minimize or mitigate my taxes?\u201d Daniel Milan, Investment Advisor and Managing Partner of Cornerstone Financial Services in Southfield, Michigan, says, \u201cThe answer to that question is, as the business owner, there are a number of levers of which you can pull to take advantage of the current rules and regulations. Because you are the owner and the decision maker, you sit in the envious position to be able to make the decisions yourself with the right advice.\u201dThe number of \u201clevers\u201d available may also require legal and benefits advice, too.\u201cWe look at the business structure to make sure it is set up correctly,\u201d says David Mucciaro, Founding Partner at Doxa Capital in Charlotte, North Carolina. \u201cThen, we would talk about contributions to a retirement plan (that can defer your taxes until you need to take withdrawals) and Health Savings Accounts. Finally, we would investigate deductible business expenses and if there is a possibility of adding family to the payroll. No one can avoid taxes completely, but we can absolutely ensure your business is running at maximum efficiency.\u201dIt\u2019s commonly understood that retirement plans offer one path to sometimes significant tax reduction. In fact, don\u2019t be surprised if this is the entry level for the tax mitigation question.\u201cThe most often asked question I receive from small business owners is, \u2018How do I reduce how much I am paying in taxes each year?\u2019\u201d says Urban Adams, Investment Advisor at Dynamic Wealth Advisors in Orange County, California. \u201cMy response most often is, \u2018How much are you contributing to your plan?\u2019 If you are going to write a big check each year, would you rather 100% of that go to satisfying your tax bill, or would you like for some part of that to go into your own pocket by way of your retirement plan?\u201d## #4: \u201cWhat\u2019s the best way to design a retirement plan?\u201dYou know there are any number of ways to structure a retirement plan. The first step, though, is to identify the motivation behind the desire to establish one. Here, there may be more to it than meets the eye.\u201cMy team receives this question a lot: \u2018How will offering a retirement plan benefit me as an owner?\u2019\u201d says Tilisha Conley, G&A Partners at 401k Manager in Houston. \u201cThe owner tax deductions are one benefit, but we also point out the importance of recruiting and retention and helping employees save toward their retirement.\u201dIt\u2019s critical to outline your objectives and circumstances when it comes to putting together the optimal retirement plan for your specific situation.\u201cThe question I am most asked by business owners is: \u2018What is the best type of plan for me and my employees?\u2019,\u201d says Don Cody, President and CEO at Global Macro Asset Management in Las Vegas. \u201cMy response is \u2018it depends.\u2019 What is your age? How many employees? How are you and they compensated? There are many choices, and there are minefields, but there are some great opportunities for an owner and their employees if you take the time to explore them.\u201dMany business owners question whether their business is large enough to offer this benefit.\u201cThe two most often asked questions are: \u2018Isn\u2019t my business too small to offer a 401(k) plan?\u2019 and \u2018Isn\u2019t it very complex to offer/administer a 401(k) plan?\u2019\u201d says Craig Silverstein, Senior Product Strategy Manager for Retirement Services at Paychex, Inc.  PAYX in Rochester, New York. \u201cThe answer is that the business is not too small, and you can \u2018outsource\u2019 plan administration to ease the responsibilities of the business owner and/or the administration employees. A pooled employer plan (PEP) can help with this or hiring a 3(16) plan administrator.\u201dWith these possible solutions, the question of cost keeps coming back.\u201cA common question from small business owner-employees is the expense of providing this benefit,\u201d says Jackie Reeves, Managing Director at Bell Rock Capital in Boca Raton, Florida. \u201cAnd the most efficient response is to build the 401(k) plan design to be inclusive of maximum company contributions as a component to employee compensation packages. This type of 401(k) plan design then, would not impose substantive expense changes with each new hire, but rather ensure its success for the employees and the single owner. In the long and short-term, financially fit employees and owners are more productive.\u201dUltimately, the retirement plan isn\u2019t just about tax deferment, it\u2019s about the owner\u2019s exit strategy. It\u2019s not enough to say \u201cmy business is my retirement.\u201d It\u2019s much safer to take the conservative approach and, as mentioned earlier, integrate your business into your life. It should be the means to feed that comfortable retirement you\u2019ll eventually seek.\u201cThe most common question I get asked from a small business owner is \u2018How much do I need to save to be comfortable in retirement time?\u2019\u201d says Nolan Baker, Investment Advisor Representative for The Retirement Guys Formula in Maumee, Ohio. \u201cTo answer that question, we recommend developing a financial plan that can incorporate the family\u2019s individual goals and objectives. Then in the plan, adjustments can be made such as retirement age, savings rate, and investment return to develop a plan that is optimized to reach those goals. Most planning software can stress test the plan for additional weaknesses and to see how on target the current or proposed plan is.\u201dThis approach shouldn\u2019t underplay the fact that your business is an asset. It has a value. Sure, you can simply walk away from it, but wouldn\u2019t it be better to realize that value in some way?Julie Murphy, Owner of JMC Wealth Management, Inc. in Chicago, says business owners can be concerned about a \u201clack of a succession plan\u2026 how to do it when they have no heirs or no people internally that want and/or can financially buy it. My answer to them is start walking them through different exit strategy options like: 1) Sell to competitors, but find an evaluator in their industry; 2) Create an internal stock plan and if they don\u2019t have one create a board of directors; or, 3) Survey inside the company of potential senior management to buy them out.\u201dRemember, you may have already asked these questions. That doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t ask them again. This time you might just discover the answer has changed.Don\u2019t wait until that change surprises you. Stay on top of these questions. It\u2019s the surest way to help you stay on top of your business.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

A Complete Newbie Buys Her First Adult Watch # Introducing The Doxa Sub 600T Pacific Limited EditionAn Aubry-era throwback, now in titanium.August 30, 2021What We KnowJust in time for Geneva Watch Days, here is the latest from the fine folks at Doxa, a limited edition re-thinking of an Aubry-era classic \u2013 the Sub 600T. Produced in partnership with _Time+Tide_ (a watch blog and Doxa partner based in Australia), the new Sub 600T \"Pacific\" is an updated expression of a still-under-the-radar winner from the fab world of Doxa's back catalog.Hopefully suggesting an eventual full line of multi-colored 600Ts, as of right now the new Sub 600T is being offered only in Pacific Blue, and production is limited to just 200 units. Further supporting a Pelagos-adjacent vibe, the Sub 600T has a 40mm brushed titanium case with a rich blue dial and a matching blue rubber strap (with titanium hardware). Water-resistance is 600 meters and the caseback is closed and individually numbered for the limited edition.Looking quite different from the brand's better-known dive watch roots in the Sub 300, the Sub 600T came in the early '80s after Doxa was acquired by the Aubry Fr\u00e8res Company in 1978. With a chunky angular case and a partially shrouded crown at four, the 600T had a distinctly '80s vibe that has aged nicely, and original models remain ever-collectible.A happy pile of vintage Doxa 600Ts.The 40mm sizing is paired with a lug-to-lug of 47.6mm and a total thickness of 14.15mm (not bad for a watch good to 600 meters, or roughly 560 meters deeper than I hope to go any time soon). With Doxa-proper bright orange accents, the 600T looks surprisingly modern and I think it's cool to see Doxa fit a blue ceramic version of their no-deco bezel insert.Priced at $1,990, the Sub 600T uses a Sellita SW200-1 automatic movement, comes with its matching blue rubber strap, and is limited to just 200 individually numbered pieces.What We ThinkI love it. But hey, it's a limited edition 40mm titanium dive watch from one of the most overlooked brands in dive watches \u2013 so what did you expect me to say? While the blue is perhaps a bit too bright for my preference \u2013 just imagine a Sharkhunter or Searambler version \u2013 and I think a watch such as this _needs_ drilled lugs (even if the original didn't have them), I don't have much in the way of complaints.Doxa 600T's are exceedingly cool and collectible dive watches, and they represent a special time for the brand and a design that helped Doxa grow beyond that of the Sub 300 (a watch I'm wearing while writing this). I think the size, the case shape, the dial balance, and the bezel design look excellent and though it's unlikely that they will have loaners for such a limited model, I do hope I eventually get to see one of these in the metal \u2013 and preferably on a NATO.For less than two grand, with a reliable and easily serviced Swiss movement, the 600T LE looks like a bright blue winner that takes a vintage-inspired formula and simply rethinks the usual mid-century date range. I've got my fingers tightly crossed in hopes that they sell all 200 quickly and then expand the line with standard models in Doxa's signature core colors. Also, this case would look awfully cool in carbon, no?**Brand:** Doxa   **Strap/Bracelet:** Blue rubber with titanium folding claspPricing & Availability **Limited Edition:** 200 individually numbered piecesShop this storyThe Doxa Sub 600T Pacific Limited Edition is available directly though Doxa's own website.DoxaRead this Next### Introducing The MB&F; X L'Ep\u00e9e 1839 OrbBy James Stacey### Introducing The Bulgari Octo Roma Central Tourbillon PapillonBy Jack Forster### Introducing Greubel Forsey Drops The Mic At Geneva Watch DaysBy Logan Baker### Introducing The Bulgari Octo Roma WorldTimerBy Jon Bues  1.

We met with pretty much every brand on the calendar, made it to the Geneva Watch Days tent every night (if only for a quick hello/goodbye on Thursday), and set some exciting projects in motion.You can't beat the face-to-face interaction you're confronted with every day at Geneva Watch Days. It makes such a difference to once more see our friends and colleagues after such a long absence, and those relationships that have deepened in different ways due to the pandemic suddenly seem injected with the kind of vitality we'd all been missing in the back of our minds. I can't wait to share with you the result of some of those conversations (because I know you'll be just as thrilled as we are), but before that, it's time for the writers that attended the fair to choose their favorite watch to grace their wrist this week.## Lex \u2013 Ferdinand Berthoud Chronom\u00e8tre FB 1.6-3 for Monaco's Art in TimeThere can be only one, and there is only one: the Ferdinand Berthoud Chronom\u00e8tre FB 1.6-3 for Monaco's Art in Time. I picked a watch that I can never ever own. First, because there is only one. And second of all, the watch is made for Monaco retailer Art in Time, and it will be in the shop window carrying a price tag of $208,500. I just can\u2019t get to that kind of money quick enough. And I say quick enough because I was a watch connoisseur with some cash in my pocket, this black beauty would be mine.Let\u2019s start with the simple thing. The steel case measures 44\u00d713mm and has a coating of black DLC \u2014 Ferdinand Berthoud has never done that before, but they should consider doing it some more because the octagonal shape of the case looks mysterious and sinister in this livery.The movement inside Ferdinand Berthoud\u2019s one-off COSC-certified chronometer has also undergone special treatment, so it colors black. You can see a lot through the sapphire case back, but also quite a bit through two smaller sapphire windows on the side of the case.The movement inside is the FB-T.FC-2. Highlights are the tourbillon with suspended fusee cone and suspended mainspring barrel. The one-minute tourbillon drives the center seconds hand, and that direct-drive system is a Ferdinand Berthoud patent. There\u2019s also a free-sprung balance and a balance spring with a Phillips overcoil.An incredibly impressive and fascinating piece of horology, this movement. But for me, the absolute highlight of the Chronom\u00e8tre FB 1.6-3 for Monaco's Art in Time are the bridges. They\u2019re done in sapphire. And on top of that, the edges are beveled. The work that has gone into that is mind-blowing. The result is subtle, but so incredibly pleasing through the lens of a magnifying glass. And that\u2019s why I picked this watch.Plus the fact that a portion of that will go to benefit the Fondation Prince Albert II de Monaco. This foundation funds projects that aim to \u201cmitigate the effects of climate change, promote renewable energy, preserve biodiversity, manage water resources, and fight against desertification.\u201d Who can be against that? More information is available on Ferdinand Berthoud\u2019s official website.## Dave \u2014 H Moser & Cie Streamliner Perpetual CalendarThis was a very difficult question for me to answer. If I recall correctly, I think I fell in love with a new watch every day, so picking just one felt harsh on the others. But, I'm a \"consummate professional\" so I did just that. Like an episode of Take Me Out, I whittled them down to just two. The Moser Streamliner Perpetual Calendar and the Doxa Sub 600T. As you can probably guess, it was the Moser that won out as the eventual winner.This might have been why\u2026The Streamliner caused a bit of a stir when it was stepped into the market. Since then, we've seen a chronograph, three-hander, and now a perpetual calendar. For me, the new perpetual calendar is the pick of the bunch. That said, the Streamliner case and bracelet are so god-damn gorgeous that I think they'd be able to carry any complication stashed within them to the cusp of perfection in my eyes.## RJ \u2014 Gerald Genta Micky MouseI have a soft spot for these Gerald Genta retrograde watches with Mickey Mouse. Mike reviewed it on Fratello this week (here), so go there if you want all details on this Mickey watch. Genta started creating these Mickey Mouse watches a long time ago, and using different case shapes. You'll find them with octagonal cases, tonneau cases, and round cases. My favorites from the past are the ones with a golfing Mickey Mouse and a Mickey Mouse in a racing suit. Some people complain about having a Disney (or comic) character on a watch, but I like it when you don't take yourself (or your watch) too seriously. The watch has a jumping hour (round aperture) and a retrograde minute scale. In the picture above, it is 3:39.As you can see in the pictures above, the people at Bvlgari (who bought the Gerald Genta company in 2000) take the manufacturing of the watch very seriously though. The beautiful case, sunburst dial, crown, and movement are all components they've developed with the greatest care. The movement has C\u00f4tes de Gen\u00e8ve decoration and the rotor has the Gerald Genta initials engraved in there. This watch is limited to 150 pieces only and has a retail price of CHF16,500. It is a bit out of my league right now, but if I could, I'd wear this watch. A lot.## Rob (me) \u2014 Czapek Antarctique RattrapanteThat hello/goodbye on Thursday that I mentioned in the opening paragraph was between Xavier de Roquemaurel and me. After a wild year that saw us release the hotly-anticipated Viridian Green Antarctique, Czapek has enjoyed another limited edition sell-out success. And you know what? As biased as I am towards our own Antarctique project I have to say selling 77 pieces of this divinely wrought Rattrapante chronograph might be even more impressive.Let's not forget, this model is two and a half times the price (coming in a couple of grand over 50K when taxes are factored in). And yet, it is so, so worth it (if you happen to have 50K to spend on a watch).I think most people go through a skeletonized watch phase. For some, the phase is traversed quickly. For others, the love lingers. I had my phase very early in my life. It was a couple of years after I started working in a watch shop. I must have been about 19 or so when I suddenly found myself obsessed with skeletonized Rotary watches. That bg bit me hard and lasted about a year. Ever since I've moved further and further away from that over-the-top style in favor of clear, legible dials.### A shift as sudden as a split-second hand stopAnd then Czapek released a highly legible skeletonized Rattrapante chronograph and my eyes nearly fell out of my skull. I was drawn back into the wonder of watchmaking immediately. Wearing it on my wrist was an experience I don't think I'll ever forget in a week packed full of them.Luckily for my watch collection (which would need to be mostly sold to afford this one), the Rattrapante is sold out. I've decided therefore to start saving now and request Xavier that he makes me a solid 18-karat rose gold version especially for me so I can buy it when my time comes to exit the hobby of watch collecting\u2026 If you like the sound of that too, let me know and I'll have a word.Thanks for following us throughout the fair this week. Later on today we've got Jorg's top ten GWD picks from afar to come (he was based in the Hague helping out with coverage remotely). There will be more in-depth coverage of the things we saw this week once we've got back to reality and sifted through the thousands of images Bert shot for the Fratelli to enjoy.  2.

I\u2019m not going to wax lyrical about it again but suffice to say I really did consider cancelling my incoming Viridian Green and selling off half of my collection to pay for it.A quick re-watch of Rob\u2019s (entirely unnecessary as it turned out!) sales pitch video for the Fratello X Czapek was enough to persuade me to hold course though.Maybeez you could ask Xavier to whistle me up a white gold one when he is sorting you out with your rose one Rob?

The summer has hit The Hague and Fratello is keen to celebrate. After the fizzing success of March Mania, we are back with the Summer Splash. A new knock-out competition conceived to find the very best summer watch out there, according to YOU, the Fratelli. And guess what? You can win prizes! No, there won't be a watch available this time but there WILL be some of the finest water-firing weapons money can buy: the Spyra 2 water cannon is reputedly the strongest of its kind ever made. Fancy getting your hands on one? Read on and take part in the comments section of this article.This time around, eight writers will choose three of their favorite summer watches and pitch them to you. The rules? The watches must be under \u20ac5,000, water-resistant to _at least_ 100 meters, and actually _available_ to buy. That doesn't mean they can't be limited (I have a limited on my list, for example), but they can't be sold out at the time of writing.The logic? We want this to actually help people to decide what to buy. Crucially, therefore, whichever watch wins has to be in stock. For the sake of our consciences remaining clear, it has to be something that is able to stand up to the environments it's likely to meet as a summer beater. And while you might disagree with us here, we don't think that many people want a _super_ expensive watch on their wrists when jumping into the pool, kayaking across oceans, scaling fearsome peaks, or getting so slamming drunk by the pool you are more likely than not to fall _up_ the stairs as you stagger to your room.Look, we know \"expensive\" is all relative. Maxing out this budget would be a dream for many people, but we're just saying that as cool as it is, the MB&F HM7 Aquapod isn't going to feature on this list. And while you may be sad to see the absence of _Haute Horlogerie_ this here is a contest to find the rootinest, tootinest, rough and ready rider to stick with you through the thick and thin of planet Earth's most bodacious season.That's right, people: summer is here, my vernacular has morphed into a heatstroke-induced mishmash of 1897 _and_ 1987, which means it must be time to grab the water wings and cool off. Get ready to SPLASH!I've owned the Laco Squad Amazonas for a couple of years now and it has never disappointed me. It would be fair to say that it was not a watch on my radar before I had the chance to review it but it quickly became my favorite model from a brand far better known for its pilot's watches.> \u2026its supreme legibility comes to the fore in even the slightest shade.Firstly, I'm not actually a big fan of pilot's watches. Secondly, I'm a massive fan of anything well made. The Laco Squad Amazonas is definitely one of the best-constructed tool watches I've encountered, and while its goofy \"multi-green\" display may seem a bit basic or bodged together at first, its supreme legibility comes to the fore in even the slightest bit of shade.You see, that green isn't just luminous, it's fluorescent. It glows in _daylight_. It positively cuts through the gap between eyes and markers in dusk or twilight. The minute hand is the same color and thus has a binding relationship to the bezel scale. But it is the bezel itself that is the ultimate beauty of this brilliant beater. The \"click\" of the Laco Squad bezels is one of the most satisfying clicks you will find in the industry. Be it the blue, orange, or green colorways, be sure of this: the way this thing is built will not disappoint. It is a flashy watch? No. Is it a big brand? No way. But is it a faultless companion for under \u20ac1,000 that offers premium functionality at a budget, summer-friendly price? You bet it is.Just give it the Summer Splash crown now\u2026Okay, I'm sorry, the picture above is of my personal Aquadive Poseidon, which is long since sold out (the last of the 300 pieces was snapped up months ago). However, the Bathysphere 100 GMT is exactly the same watch without the (awesome) Poseidon branding. I was actually really surprised it took the Aquadive Poseidon as long to sell out as it did, given its limitation, incredible \"historical ties\" to Doxa, quite frankly amazing aesthetic, and the rampant popularity of the Poseidon brand, but there you go.> \u2026a 1,000 (yes, one _thousand_ ) meter water resistance.Maybe I expected too much from a brand I personally rate very highly. Maybe it somehow slipped through the net of attention. Or perhaps it simply ran into a lot of strong competition at the time of its release. Then again, the fourth possibility is that I'm barking mad and that this watch isn't anywhere near as good as I think it is for $1,990 (which is excluding VAT).I'm pretty convinced I'm not crazy, though. After two decades in this game, I'm pretty confident that I know a good dive watch from a bad one. Sure, you need to get over the C-shaped case. You need to feel comfortable with the 42mm diameter, 49mm lug-to-lug, and 14.1mm total case height (including the lugs), but if those dimensions fit within your regular wheelhouse, what can you expect?### They should call it the Aquadive Bargainsphere 100 GMTFor less than \u20ac2.5K when taxes are accounted for, you get an ETA 2893-powered GMT watch with a 1,000 (yes, one _thousand_ ) meter water resistance. This thing comes on an ISOfrane strap, which will send some dive watch fanatics gooey at the knees, but it isn't for me. I wear my Poseidon on an Erika's Originals strap (with the buckle engraved with 1.000m in case I ever forget). It keeps what could be an otherwise unwieldy watch head (and that is not an understatement \u2014 this is a chunky piece of kit) firmly in place on the top of my wrist all summer long.## TOCKR Air-Defender Chronograph Hydro-Dip Tie DyeI had a rare old day in Vallorbe a couple of years back with Serge from TOCKR, as we explored the process behind Hyrdo-Dipping. Let's be frank here, this kind of finish is not for everyone. In fact, it's probably not even for 10% of people. But TOCKR realized that in this evermore individualistic world, that doesn't matter. Everybody knows you're never going to please everybody all of the time. So why try? Zero-in on your audience and go all out.Is this pick going to win me the competition? I would guess not. Will it garner a fair few votes in the poll below? I would guess it might, simply because it is a joyfully ridiculous watch. This model (now luminous) is available for $3,250 plus a few bucks international shipping. It's well within budget, water-resistant to 100 meters, has a sun-catching blue sun-ray dial, and the funkiest, most flip-flop-ready case color ever. A no-brainer for the Summer Splash shootout.And the low-key best bit about this watch? The strap options from Hix in the USA are _amazing_. Honestly, it is one of the few watches in my collection that ends up on my wrist because of the strap _before_ the watch head. They are that cool. Check out the company that makes them by hand in Oklahoma here. Once you've done that, it's time to vote. Which of my summery sensations makes it through to the head-to-head phase of the Summer Splash competition? Will it be the Laco, the unlimited Aquadive Bathysphere GMT, or the fearlessly fruity TOCKR Air Defender?  * Who moves on from Rob's group?    * TOCKR Air Defender Hydro Dip Tie DyeSplishy, splashy in the tub.  2.

Going for the Aquadive as even, if I'd rather go bare wrist, I have to admit it has character and personality.  Curious to read other comments on these three and eventually evolve a bit \u2026 who knows \ud83d\ude00 ?!!    1. **Timo** says:Aug 19, 2021 at 23:07Summer, sun, carefree late nights, bright convertibles, sipping pina coladas\u2026 there are moments, when an ostentatious timepiece on the wrist is just the perfect companion \ud83d\udd7a      1. **Rob** says:Aug 23, 2021 at 10:52Getting a real John Travolta vibe from you right now\u2026Aug 19, 2021 at 12:38Haha. No to GMT. No to the internet. No to mobile phones. I don't want to communicate or know what time it is back home when i'm in my hammock downing a cool one. Still, the Aquadive is one classy looking watch.    1. **DaDutchCollection** says:Aug 19, 2021 at 18:13Agree, agree, agree, agree and\u2026 agree!  3. **Warky** says:Aug 19, 2021 at 13:46My favourite of these is the Laco - and is the only one of these I would actually consider buying - but since we are purely voting on a summer watch then that fabulously whimsical TOCKR gets my vote.The 1000m resistance is Uber overkill for me (as indeed is 100m!) and the additional wrist estate that requires for the Aquadive means it\u2019s not a practical watch for me. Love the styling though.Off to a great start though - I wouldn\u2019t have expected any of these three from Rob! The best part of March Mania was finding about about watches that I was really not aware of. Looks like I am in for the same treat \ud83d\ude03    1. **DaDutchCollection** says:Aug 19, 2021 at 18:12Here we go again mate \ud83d\ude09Compromising our own personal choices in name of a purely hypothetical scenario.  But indeed broadens my views too, so great to have another high dosage of maniacal commenting.  Let the comments begin.    2. **Timo** says:Aug 19, 2021 at 19:12Ha, agree, a situation that requires 1000m water resistance is not exactly something you'll casually encounter. 100m though? Jumping into the pool is \u2013 imo! \u2013 definitely something any watch that wants to call itself a summer watch needs to be able to handle. Unfortunately, I currently have a 100m watch on my wrist\u2026 but no pool in sight. \ud83e\udd72  4. **Solo** says:Aug 19, 2021 at 14:35His taste for his watches is as \"good\" as his taste for his shirts (Tockr, like\u2026 for real!? \ud83d\ude00 ) I'm gonna pass    1. **Timo** says:Aug 19, 2021 at 19:17What's life without a bit of diversion off the beaten path?! If everyone and their mother had a Black Bay on their wrist, that would be boring \ud83d\ude04 But, I hear you\u2026 personally, I'm also not one for flashy designs, to be honest\u2026 so, keep an eye on the upcoming rounds \ud83d\ude42Aug 19, 2021 at 20:51Agreed. Especially when it comes to a summer watch: let it be fun! I've got a bright orange nato for my dive watches in the summer, and it just makes me smile.        1. **Timo** says:Aug 19, 2021 at 23:12For a while now, an Omega PloProf regularly shows up in my Instagram feed \u2013 on a bright orange rubber strap. Always makes me smile \ud83d\udc4f    2. **Rob** says:Aug 20, 2021 at 13:15Are you hating on that fetching blue number by Charles Tyrwhitt in the vid? Man, that's brutal. When you're as shapely as I am it's hard to find a good fit\u2026OH WAIT I GET IT.MY TASTE IS \"TIGHT\".Aug 19, 2021 at 15:14I have to go with the Laco. I won't spend all of summer lounging by the pool and the Laco has the most versatile dial, especially given my conservative taste in watches. That said, the Aquadive would be fun and would certainly get some attention.  6. **DaDutchCollection** says:Aug 19, 2021 at 18:00Tough nut to crack Boss\u2026 This is quite the eclectic miss.  I \"promise\" the misspell was just due to mixed feelings, no misstep intended \ud83d\ude2c  Gulp\u2026 Not my best of start, hein?I like Laco's proposition for its modern diver interpretation, bold colour schemes and aggressive bezel teeth.  The Aquadive is more my thing and I have chosen it.  Mostly for being a bare knuckles skin-diver with a chunky stance. Solid.  Never had much use or need for a GMT, but looking as good as this one, I wouldn't mind.The TOCKR is an acquired taste, one that I haven't acquired yet, perhaps to my own loss.  It does remind me of those old school soup bars for crude usage.  That's a nice thought. Takes me back to good places.    1. **Timo** says:Aug 19, 2021 at 23:00Same here, also voted Aquadive. After all, if there's an eclectic miss\u2026 er\u2026 mix, might as well go with the really bold and flashy option. And\u2026 it's not just all show: That 1000m water resistance\u2026 party in the looks department, business in functionality \ud83d\udc4c  7. **Eriktig** says:Aug 19, 2021 at 18:47Aquadive, for sure! Gotta love how the depth of the dial is used for the GMT scale \ud83d\ude42  8. **Agnar** says:Aug 19, 2021 at 19:26Out of these 3, the Laco would be my pick. I\u2019m intrigued by the fluorescent material and how this is in the everyday usage - a bit more of this color on the watch would be nice:)    1. **DaDutchCollection** says:Aug 19, 2021 at 23:09If it would have been the orange version, I would likely follow suit \ud83d\ude09Aug 19, 2021 at 20:21The goofy 'multi-green Laco is my vote too. The color transforms the watch. Those zany Germans\u2026  10. **John** says:Aug 19, 2021 at 20:27Hey Robb I also own the same Aquadive Bathysphere GMT, and I am in total agreement with you regarding that watch, because it is just a wonderful piece! I've been wearing it a lot this summer: Great lume, great wear and always keeping time within COSC. I've taken it swimming and snorkeling a couple of times (no diving yet-but will eventually) and it has been perfect. The bezel action is crisp and clean. As you astutely point out, it is quite the value proposition and it definitely punches above it's weight class.    1. **Timo** says:Aug 19, 2021 at 23:15Sounds like you found yourself a trusty companion for your summer adventures! \ud83d\ude4c  It's also the Aquadive that got my vote here.Aug 20, 2021 at 05:53Dang, that's gotta be one of your funniest articles. I almost laughed out loud, no small feat for a watch article.  At first I was thinking that crown guards were absolutely necessary for summer shenanigans, but then I saw the Tockr. That watch IS summer shenanigans. Lumed tie-die hydrodipped case?? Completely over-equipped chrono and inner rotating bezel? It deserves to be the watch of summer. It should be worn and destroyed, full embodiment of \"extra\" hedonistic revelry that it is.    1. **Rob** says:Aug 23, 2021 at 10:55Haha, thanks, Thomas. I'm glad I was able to bring a smirk to your lips. Cheers for the analysis and here's to a long summer!Aug 20, 2021 at 18:00Great artcicle (consciousnesses? aside) and all three are great choices. Sided with the Aquadive as I love some unneccesary WR overkill.    1. **Rob** says:Sep 09, 2021 at 11:06Jeez, it must have been totally unconscious when I wrote that. Took me an age to see what I'd done. Thanks for the spot!Aug 20, 2021 at 21:47I went for the Laco. The bang for buck cannot be beaten (I have a B Uhr from the brand). The orange would be my choice though ;-). As for the Aquadive I love the colors and styling, but it\u2019s a little overkill - and I don\u2019t favor super chunky wrist armor. The TOCKR would be a lot of fun with its colorful and glowing case - but it isn\u2019t exactly inexpensive and might not be for everyday wear.  14. **lvoky** says:Aug 22, 2021 at 09:29I wasn't expecting any usual choices from Rob, but these are really some unusual piece. Flashy, competent, with some out-of-the box thinking. I like that, but I would love to see some non-dive thing in the selection, just for variety. The Aquadive takes the crown here for me, just by pure looks, it is really the one I like - it is unusual enough, but not that crazy as the Tockr (yes, surprisingly that is too much for me) and a bit more standing out than the Laco. So here we go.    1. **Rob** says:Aug 23, 2021 at 11:00Whatever happens, I think I am going to get totally battered in the next round.Aug 22, 2021 at 12:38For me the Laco fits the bill\u2026 it's a historic brand and this watch takes the essentials of a dive watch and amplifies them into a really cool style statement \ud83d\ude0e.    1. **Rob** says:Aug 23, 2021 at 11:01Who'd have thought \"multi-green\" would have been so popular\u2026Summer Splash Wild Card Round 1: The Fratelli Join The Fray \u2014 Seiko, NOMOS, Casio, And MoreWhy I Bought The New Omega Speedmaster Moonwatch \u2014 And Went With The Hesalite VersionSummer Splash: What Is The Best Summer Watch?

Quarter Finals \u2014 Doxa Vs. ZelosDavid squares off against Goliath in a battle for the agesDave & BalazsSeptember 11, 2021Hopefully, you enjoyed the exposure of corruption and scandal in the group stages of the Summer Splash earlier this week. What's a sporting competition without little friendly misdemeanor? I mean, I WAS involved, but not on purpose, I swear! But the time for masking this corruption with chit-chat has long gone. It\u2019s time for things to get serious. In the final of the quarter-final match-ups, I will take on B-Dawg Balazs for a place in the final four. Our champions? The Hound of Hungary brings in the uber-cool Doxa Sub300T Forged carbon while I, \"Bob\" Sergeant, sit in the corner of the underdog, the Zelos Mako V3 Titanium. Let's be having it!Let\u2019s kick things off in this Summer Splash quarter-final with Balazs' offering in this battle of David vs Goliath. The Doxa has to be the favorite, but perhaps my Zelos can punt it through the posts for a last-minute win? Let's see\u2026## Doxa Sub300 CarbonI respect my opponent, and while it may be true that Dave is bringing a knife to a gunfight, let's try to be civilized. After all, we are talking about two magnificent timepieces here. The Zelos is a remarkable watch with a nice amount of variations. Although most of them are sold out, there are about six models left that you can choose from. Aside from the versatility, the price is also on their side. $549 is a steal, and as we say, \"a lot of watch for the money.\" So in my eyes, the Zelos Mako V3 Titanium is a noble enemy of my beloved Doxa Sub300T Forged Carbon.But come on, let's be honest, price aside, the Doxa is a winner by far. Let's start with the obvious, the forged carbon case does not only look fabulous on the wrist, but it is a material that you don't often see in the watch industry. At least not for this price point. Thanks to the light weight of the case and the rubber strap, the watch feels virtually like nothing on the wrist. Now, if you want a big piece, go with the steel version. But I guess the Zelos's titanium case also makes it light.## As cool as it gets this summerLet's move on from the case and strap and take a look at the dial variants. Just like Zelo, Doxa also offers the watch in six dial colors and ten iterations, thanks to the matching colorful rubber straps as an option next to the classic black. And just look at those colors! If you know Doxa's history, most dials, like orange, black, yellow, or silver, make total sense. Yet, the company added two new colors to the lineup, navy blue, and turquoise. So you have plenty of options to choose from, just like with the Zelos.Another thing my Doxa has going for it is its provenance. We are talking about an OG brand that's not only been producing dive watches for decades and constantly reinventing themselves, but it was one of the forerunners for this market segment. Just think of the very first Sub 300 from 1967 and how revolutionary it was back then. Probably just as mindblowing as this new model with its forged carbon case. Decades and decades of experience boil down to a fine product like my Doxa Sub 300 Forged Carbon. Dave, my dear friend, you were at Geneva Watch Days too. You saw the new Doxa and talked with the lovely people from the brand. There's so much more to come; we just have to be patient.## Battle of the summer price tagsI have to be fair, though. We both know that the Zelos is a much cheaper option than the Doxa. Now, I think the price should not determine the quality of a watch. Yet, I also believe that you should expect better quality, usability, design, etc. The Doxa Sub 300 Forged Carbon cost a pretty penny (\u20ac3,790), and I still need to justify this as a price tag if I want one. But if I had the funds ready, would I jump on it? The answer is, as they say, \"110%\". I own a vintage Sharkhunter with the Aqua Lung logo; I have the modern re-edition of the Doxa Sub 300 Black Lung in the steel case. When the first forged Carbon Doxa, the Sub 300 Carbon Aqua Lung US Divers, hit the market, I could not wait to strap it on my wrist. It's still my favorite contemporary Doxa model, and I hope to own one someday. Maybe I'll settle for one of these Sub 300 Carbons until then.However, this game is not about me or _my_ preferences, though I'm not afraid to show a bit of bias. In truth, it's all about you, our dear reader and Fratelli, and what _you_ think about these two models. Should the Doxa go to the next round (YES)? Or should it be the Zelos (NO)? Put everything in the mixer: price, looks, technology, design, heritage. Press the button and drink the info smoothie on both pieces. I'm sure you'll vote wisely and click that little tab next to the name: Doxa Sub 300 Carbon \ud83d\ude42You may have seen the Summer Splash scandals earlier this week; sadly, yours truly was involved with a dubious refereeing decision. If this was football, I'd be out there in the referee's face, probably earning myself a second yellow and a subsequent red card. It's probably for the best this is the Summer Splash, then. After the dust settled, my second challenger ended up taking the bye and moving on to the second round. I'm not too distraught as all three of my watches were potential winners in my eyes.This is a kind of bittersweet matchup for me, as Balazs' Doxa 300T Forged Carbon is an incredible watch. There's no denying it. I think he knew what he was doing by choosing the yellow version, too, knowing it'd have me questioning myself. The Doxa is a quality watch, but I think the Zelos just pips it regarding the budget. The Zelos Mako gives buyers a solid titanium dive watch with 300m of water resistance for $549 USD. Previously the price had been even lower at $449 USD, but even now, this is an absolute steal!As previously mentioned, I put my money where my mouth is, and I bought a Zelos earlier this year. People often ask us if we like a watch, and the answer is often \"yes\". Liking a watch and buying a watch are two distinctively different things. So, I've purchased a Zelos, but has Balazs bought his Doxa? I don't think he has\u2026 Ten points to the Zelos!Suppose you've not had a hands-on experience with a Zelos watch. In that case, you need only visit one of the many Microbrand Facebook groups to quickly see how well regarded they are amongst collectors. Customer service is considered one of the best in the microbrand biz. The brand owner personally takes care of any issues. Interestingly, Zelos is one of the very few microbrands that easily holds its value on the second-hand market. Some of the more popular models are regularly selling on eBay for considerably more than the retail value.### Why choose just one shade of summer?Now that's all well and good, isn't it, but we're here to determine the best summer watch. Customer service and value retention are excellent, but the watch's quality and the stunning range of colors on display really take the cake, in my opinion. Yes, Balazs' Doxa also offers a rainbow of colors, but with the Zelos, you could have one of each colorway and change left over. Although I'm sure that small chunk of change will soon be claimed by the bar, as you buy a fancy, fruity cocktail for each of your new watches. Surely that multi-threat is too much for him to overcome? You know what to do \u2014 vote Zelos!_Follow us on Instagram:@davesergeant & @ferenczibazs_### Summer Splash Round Two \u2014 Balazs Vs.

Others accompanying it such as Gigandet, Golda etc. went the way of the Dodo during the quartz crisis. Not Doxa, a brand which stayed afloat when many others sank and goes through a true renaissance period.  Never heard of Zelos.    1. **dave** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 16:12Zelos is a microbrand based out of Singapore. It's known for creating affordable watches that punch well above their price point, as well as providing superb customer service. It's been around for a number of years now and has a very dedicating following. Definitely worth checking out if you've never heard of the brand before.  2. **Brian-Waller** says:Sep 11, 2021 at 16:22The Zelos doesn\u2019t really move me. Probably because I\u2019ve become jaded with all the dive watches on the market. It\u2019s a model type for which I can easily say those flapjacks are selling like hotcakes. Shoot, I even have a couple of divers, both of which I\u2019m itching to get in the pool as soon as it\u2019s complete in a week. Doxa comes in distant second for one of its primary selling points - the carbon case. Sorry, but it looks like something you could make in an Easy Bake oven or one of those Hot Wheels kits they used to advertise. Now if it changed colors depending on water temperature that might make it interesting. Wouldn\u2019t buy it even then but it would rate a passing mention to my wife.    1. **Ron_W** says:Sep 11, 2021 at 17:48It actually does change colour the deeper you get !  The deeper you get the colder it is right ?  And all colour disappears the deeper you dive, starting with red and then orange, and below 30 mtrs yellow is surrendering , fading away due to lack of light. All you have left is the charged luminescence on the hands and markers.So it`s a winner then as well for you , pretty cool yes ?      1. **Brian-Waller** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 16:13Indeed! Well done finding a positive spin for me to consider. While it doesn\u2019t change my vote it makes me laugh, which is always good. I say if what you\u2019re wearing brings you joy then that\u2019s awesome and is the ultimate validation of your choice. When I drop in on my local watchmaker and he shows me his latest prize I smile and make appreciative comments even if his latest diver isn\u2019t my cup of tea. Not my job to spoil the fun. A little stretch in the bracelet keeps you from getting too close minded.        1. **Ron_W** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 16:42Very kind of you, thanks !    2. **dave** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 16:14It's funny, as the carbon case is one of my favorite things about the Doxa! I love the material in general though, so I'm a little biased\u2026  3. **Warky** says:Sep 11, 2021 at 17:06Have to vote for the Doxa in this match up. Sorry Dave.It\u2019s just too much watch for the Zelos to take down.To rub salt in the wound, I would have voted for the North Flag had it not been wrongfully ejected from the tournament in a futile attempt to redress the earlier officiating omnishambles\ud83e\udd74    1. **Ron_W** says:Sep 11, 2021 at 17:37Warky, your comments are exceptionally well written this series and spot on !You are raising the bar here my friend, and i think it would be fair to say ; please already send a early warning to the homefront about the upcoming indoor watergun related festivities \ud83d\ude42 .      1. **Warky** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 19:46You are too kind Ron! I just post what comes to mind. A wee bit too frequently \ud83e\udd74    2. **Warky** says:Sep 11, 2021 at 21:11I should clarify that the last sentence was supposed to be a jest - but it reads like I am a douche!!! Soz Rob \ud83d\ude33    3. **dave** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 16:15I'll let you off, Warky. I had hoped my Tudor would be allowed through, but hey. What can you do!?  4. **Ron_W** says:Sep 11, 2021 at 17:25Dave, it was great having you around !Balasz picks a very cool watch here, one that i suggested myself in the pre-early-liminairies i should add in all modisty, and this one is slick and smooth, versatile without being obnoxious, sits low on the wrist due to it`s stealthy appearance, and adds just enough colour to be a happy camper without looking like a clown during a dinner party.So this will be my Champion for the coming joust. Let it be noted !The only other watch that could make it to the up coming final will be my choice for the Wild Card, if it is graced by Hiss Royal Krakeness, as i don`t see any other possible winner here to be honest. Use the rules to your advantage as we say in golf, or lack of in the rest of the civilised world, so i am allowed to have a back-up watch i think. Same when diving or planning dinner dates.Two horses in the race for me, what could possibily go wrong ??    1. **Warky** says:Sep 11, 2021 at 18:56Interesting horse to back Ron. I like it a lot, but it\u2019s not versatile enough in my view.I reckon the main competition will be won by the 300m or BB58 925\u2026.and although I have already posted elsewhere that 3 watches in Heat 1 would trump either of those for me I think the wider Fratelli will make sure that one of these Goliaths will win. A lot of Omega and Tudor fans on hereThe only thing I can see taking them down is another Omega or Tudor - maybe a Aquaterra with a bright dial in the Wildcard? I think it was a Team member that mentioned it rather than one of us though.      1. **Ron_W** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 10:36I say again : your comments are exceptionally well written this series and spot on Warky !The .925 is a serious candiate for me as well but as i also have said before, Summer is not so much about seriousness\u2026\u2026. and i am hoping the majority of the Fratelli will agree if it comes to a head to head. The Doxa will need some heavy firepower to pull out a win as Silver is the Dark Count`s only Nemesis\u2026.. ( yes dear readers, - from Transsylvania to some Tennyson - we cover it all here on Fratello \ud83d\ude09 so i hope the Carbon shield holds up.And the Black Carb could even pull off a Black Tie i think if you are brave enough to match it with a yellow bow tie which, in a more tropical surrounding then my current residence, wouldn`t be all that crazy would it ?It is that stealthy monochrome casing that is just enough dimming the yellow to let you get away with things i think, another Summer time essential if you feel me \ud83d\ude42    2. **dave** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 16:15Thanks Ron, it was nice to be here. The Tudor would have knocked the Doxa out eh?      1. **Ron_W** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 16:49I think so Dave, i think so.  Most unfair to you so you have a bargaining axe for your next contract negotiations !  5. **Eriktig** says:Sep 11, 2021 at 18:34It feels like Dave is still mourning his North Flag, and I don't blame him. I recon the writing simply is on the wall here. The Doxa forges ahead.    1. **Ron_W** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 14:14I agree Erik, against the North Flag this would have been a completely different match, probably the closest of them all.    2. **dave** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 16:16I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little gutted.  6. **JP2111** says:Sep 11, 2021 at 18:46The Doxa is so much better and logically got my vote, but it's really too expensive for what is it.  7. **lvoky** says:Sep 11, 2021 at 19:44The Doxa is super cool and colourful, but my heart beats for the Zelos. The Mako line is one of their most \"mainstream\" designs, I'd say, but it still stands out. Although not such a summer great as for example the Zelos Swordfish 40mm in full bronze, it is still a watch that gets my vote here.    1. **dave** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 16:16Thanks Lvoky! \ud83d\ude00Sep 11, 2021 at 21:15I fliped a coin and the Zelos won. Neither watch did it for me. A summer watch- diver watch should have enough lume to toast a marshmallow. Maybe the Doxa has it but I could not find a good lume shot on their website. The Zelos has good lume but at that price point I'm going with a Citizen Promaster Diver or Promaster Aqualand and toast away.    1. **dave** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 16:17Hey, I'll take the vote, even if it was won by coin flip.  9. **Yousif** says:Sep 11, 2021 at 21:20I own two Zelos\u2019s and no Doxa\u2019s but still surprised the Doxa\u2019s lost a third of the votes here. Poor poor show.  10. **Matt R** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 00:30I was gonna go with the Zelos but the \"vote with your wallet\" nailed it as well. Too bad it's losing!    1. **dave** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 16:18I put up a valiant fight though, right?Sep 12, 2021 at 16:02I like the Doxa, so I voted for the Zelos. The cost saving is a big point in its favour, of course, but the less expensive watch also deserves a vote for having the colour-matched date disc.    1. **dave** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 16:17Great point. The color-matched date wheel is a big plus.  12. **DaDutchCollection** says:Sep 12, 2021 at 21:59I caved in for the Doxa.  Even though I'm very curious to experience carbon, this isn't my favorite Sub from them.  Anyways, the summer hat fits it very well with the yellow dial, cool looking thing \ud83d\ude09Sep 13, 2021 at 02:10Doxa, even though it may be a bit overpriced, beats the Zelos like a rented mule. Doxa is one of the original Dive Watch pioneers. Their Sub series has stayed true to its original design, truer even than the Rolex Submariner.Zelos may be a quality watch at a good price, but they are an upstart micro brand that has no business being in the competition.  14. **Watcher Joe** says:Sep 13, 2021 at 03:42Timely article! I eagerly await your list of the best watches to buy as a Christmas present, which based on the trend, I assume will be published some time in mid January?  15. **Loty** says:Sep 13, 2021 at 15:08Doxa is a real diver with real heritage that can compete with the best of them. Zelos is just another watch that doesn't move me one way or another. Yet another company dropping generic Miyota movements into generic chinese cases. I'd save my money and buy Doxa.Sep 14, 2021 at 03:38These are two great watches. I would love to them in person.Sep 14, 2021 at 03:48These look like 2 really great watches.

Opinions expressed are those of the author.| Membership (fee-based)Before any piece of writing can be compelling, it must be understood. Having a specific audience in mind as you write copy for a marketing campaign or a website page helps to keep the narrative focused on speaking to the right target. But once the copy has been written, it\u2019s in your best interest to go a step further and ensure that the target audience can understand it.There are many effective ways of checking the readability of copywriting to make sure your messaging aligns with the viewers\u2019 ability to comprehend it. Some of these methods, however, take more time than communications professionals have available before a campaign is set to launch.If you need to get marketing copy finalized as soon as possible, check out the tips members of Forbes Communications Council share below to ensure that your copy will be easy for clients, prospects or another target audience to understand.Forbes Communications Council members share super fast ways to ensure target audiences will understand marketing copy.Photos courtesy of the individual members.**1\\. Show It To A Friend In The Audience**Talking with your audience is important; talking _at_ them can prove detrimental. In other words, write copy that is on their level. Use language that your audience knows and can easily use in conversation. The fastest way to check this is to show your copy to a friend who is in your audience and ask for their feedback. If they don\u2019t get your message without being provided background, make the necessary changes. - Gavin Smith, PC Matic**2\\. Bullet The Information And Look For Gaps**I create a bullet list of the key information I\u2019ve gathered from the content I\u2019m reviewing, then look for any gaps in the information where we could see fallout or where the audience could go astray. Our copy must always be clear and concise, highly aligned with the amount of time we\u2019ll be afforded by our audience to review the message we\u2019re providing, and connect the dots for them each step of the way. - Stacy Bliek, Integrity Staffing SolutionsMORE FOR YOU### Dreamers And Legal Immigration Changes Highlight New House Bill### Born In The Metaverse: Will RTFKT\u2019s New Avatar Project Be The Next Big Thing In NFTs And Fashion?### U.S. News & World Report Releases Its 2022 College Rankings**3\\. Have Someone Younger Than You Read It**I ask someone half my age to read it. If they don\u2019t get distracted or bored on their way to the end, it is short enough and engaging enough for any reader. The social media/Millennial \u201ccocktail\u201d has taught all of us how to get straight to the point. - Boaz Santiago, energyware\u2122**4\\. Utilize Readability Tech And Tests**When it comes to the readability of website pages, the Yoast SEO plugin gives specific feedback according to its readability algorithm. It is great because it adjusts as you edit. For copy in other locations, Readable.com has a very inexpensive copy checker. In general, I favor the Flesch-Kincaid readability tests. - Melanie De Caprio, SG360\u00b0I\u2019m a big fan of reading copy out loud. Our data science team studied email success rates and found out that middle-school-level English had the highest responses. Keep. It. Simple. If you read your copy out loud to a friend or co-worker and they can\u2019t understand your message, your intended audience probably won\u2019t either. - Sydney Sloan, SalesLoftForbes Communications Council is an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies. _Do I qualify?_**6\\. Assess Whether You Are Using Plain Language**Always ask yourself, \u201cAm I using plain language?\u201d Plain language provides four distinct benefits: fast reading, quick understanding, better message retention and preference for the author. Avoiding lengthy, jargon-packed copy in favor of plain language allows your target audience to understand and remember the text more easily. Further, a clearer, more effective message builds the reader\u2019s trust. - Molly Doran, Labrador**7\\. See If You\u2019re Using The Words Customers Use**First and foremost, copy should typically be built from actual conversations with customers. The easiest way to ensure it resonates is to use the words that customers use themselves. As others have stated, testing is the next way to ensure it resonates. A simple email A/B test is often the fastest way to get results quickly. - Michelle Denogean, Roadster**8\\. Run It By One Other Person, Then Through Grammarly**As a marketer and communicator, I find that the easiest and quickest way to know if my target audience will understand my copy is by running it by one other person, then through Grammarly. Though that might seem very \u201cnew age\u201d to some, Grammarly\u2019s settings allow you to dictate \u201cwho\u201d will be consuming the information, which gives me a good indication of whether or not it will resonate. - Melissa Fasano, Charcoal Bianco Collective**9\\. Make Sure Skimming It Provides The Key Takeaway**Is it skimmable? Let\u2019s be real\u2014everyone skims almost everything these days. A fast way to make sure your copy is easily digestible is to skim it yourself and make sure you\u2019re able to understand the key takeaway. - Ashley Jorgensen, Mailing.com**10\\. Read A Sentence And Try To Explain It**Read a sentence, then close your eyes and explain what the sentence is saying in simple layman\u2019s terms. If you can\u2019t remember what you just read, it\u2019s probably so full of industry jargon and technical terms that most people will gloss over it, or it will go right over their heads. My favorite quote is attributed to Einstein: \u201cIf you can\u2019t explain it simply, you don\u2019t understand it well enough.\u201d - Irene Froehlich, DrFirst, Inc.**11\\. Count How Many Key Messages You\u2019ve Included**Effective messaging is all about scannability. Attention spans are shorter than ever, and very few users read entire passages of copy. Businesses should include only two or three hyper-relevant key messages and make them stand out\u2014any longer and the copy won\u2019t stick. Flowery, verbose or overly technical language might be the right fit in some contexts, but it\u2019s usually best to be simple and clear. - David Greenberg, Act-On Software**12\\. Take It To The Front Lines**Run your new content past your customer service, tech support or sales reps\u2014the people who interact with your client base on a daily basis. Of course, it\u2019s ideal to test copy with your actual audience, but if you need speed, using your front-line team members as proxies can be the fastest way to gather feedback. - Ellen Sluder, smrtPhone**13\\. Read It First Thing In The Morning**Start with what your target audience wants and their pain points, then give them some value. For understandability, go one step beyond that: Read your copy first thing in the morning, right when you get out of bed and you\u2019re still half asleep. (Yes, before you\u2019ve had your coffee!) Does it still make sense? Was any piece of it tripping you up? If so, you know you need to rework. - Christina Hager, Ovations DigitalYou should always have those reliable pals you can text, Slack or even call for a quick copy review. Running copy by someone who will candidly tell you when you\u2019re being too wordy or using big words when smaller ones would do is key to a writer\u2019s success. Find, build and grow a community of supportive wordsmiths who are willing to give you an honest opinion at a moment\u2019s notice. - Melissa Kandel, little word studio**15\\. Read It Out Loud To Your Kids**Read it out loud to your kids and ask them what they understood. If it is not clear to them, rewrite it. While we would certainly expect our target audiences to have a better understanding of the subject matter, their attention span is often even lower than that of our kids. So, the kid test works really well to simplify messaging and get the most relevant parts highlighted accordingly. - Rafael Schwarz, TERRITORY Influence (a Bertelsmann group company)**16\\. Walk Away From It And Return With Fresh Eyes**To make sure the copy will land with my target audience, I walk away from it for 30 minutes. When I come back to it, I read it as if I\u2019m someone outside of the company who is hearing about us for the first time. - Erica Morgenstern, Welltok**17\\. Check For Clear Headlines And Skimmable Headers**The most important things to check are that the headline clearly explains what\u2019s to follow and that headers at regular intervals throughout the content provide a guide to the rest of the content. This makes the content skimmable and guides the reader down the page to the end. - Tom Treanor, Treasure Data**18\\. Look For Long Sentences That Can Be Split Up**I check to see if there are any sentences of 20 words or longer. If there are, I split them into two or more sentences. This way, the prose is easy to read and doesn\u2019t cause anyone\u2019s attention to stray. Far too often, copywriters are too verbose and wordy. Simply getting to the punch can go a long way toward sustaining your reader\u2019s attention. - Amine Rahal, Regal AssetsCheck out my website.Communications, PR, public affairs & media relations executives from Forbes Communications Council share firsthand insights.Communications, PR, public affairs & media relations executives from Forbes Communications Council share firsthand insights."}

He also noted that the releases, which he said are supported by many courts across the country, do not protect the Sacklers against potential criminal liability.A representative for the Mortimer Sackler family referred a request for comment to a prior statement disputing allegations made about the family and saying it is \"truly sorry for the suffering and loss people have experienced and recognize the anger or hurt that many people have felt.\"The total incentive payments for Purdue executives for 2021 is $4 million to $5.4 million, depending on their ability to meet their goals as they continue to work toward a bankruptcy exit. They could also collect up to an additional $1.7 million in long-term incentives. The executives would have to meet targets related to operating profits, net sales and deadlines for testing and development of non-opioid products.Drain said he did not consider the incentive payments he was approving \"bonuses\" because even if paid out in full, they would still only fall in the middle of the total compensation range for executives at major pharmaceutical companies.\"No doubt my ruling will be construed by some as authorizing large bonuses to executives. I do not believe that is in fact the case here,\" he said.(Reporting by Maria Chutchian Editing by Lisa Shumaker, Mark Porter and Sonya Hepinstall)Copyright 2021 Reuters.

Check out what's clicking today in entertainment.Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 talk show returns for its 19th and final season following a year of controversy that called the host\u2019s workplace conduct and her general demeanor into question.The show is hoping to put all that behind in the final season as it seeks to do a bit of a victory lap that highlights the show\u2019s past with an all-star roundup of guests and fan-favorite highlights.\"This is going to be a \u2018thank you\u2019 to everybody, because the show doesn't happen without the support of fans,\" DeGeneres said during a production break on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" which returned Monday.Also to be spotlighted: The show's philanthropy, which included far more than product giveaways. **ELLEN DEGENERES ADDRESSES TALK SHOW ENDING: 'I'VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THIS'**\"We\u2019re going to check in with people that we've helped through the years (and) people that have paid it forward,\" DeGeneres said. That includes a Las Vegas educator who opened her own wallet for students in need and whose school was rewarded by the show with a new library and other resources.\"I want people just to really remember what the show has been,\" the host said. \"It\u2019s been a happy place and it continues to be a happy place. And I hate that it would be remembered in any other way.\"That DeGeneres voices such concern over the legacy of her popular show should be surprising for the host-comedian whose motto is \"Be kind\" \u2014 but it's inevitable, given allegations last year that the show was produced in a toxic workplace.Ahead of the daytime talk show host\u2019s final bow, it may be worth taking a look back at the scandal that rocked the show ahead of the comedian\u2019s decision to end things:Ellen DeGeneres will begin her last season of her talk show on Monday. (Brooks Kraft/Getty Images)Fox News' published an interview with _a former bodyguard_, who documented his unsavory experience with the host. It was one of the first public signs that DeGeneres\u2019 on-screen demeanor and generally friendly nature may not have lived up to her off-screen persona.The comedian's last few years were marred by controversy about a toxic workplace environment. (ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images)Things turned up to eleven in July of 2020, when _Buzzfeed News_ came out with a report in which former and current staff members blew the whistle on an allegedly toxic work environment stemming from three producers who they claim created an environment based on bullying and fear of losing their job. ** _ELLEN DEGENERES SAYS PORTIA DE ROSSI WAS HER 'ROCK' DURING TOXIC WORK ENVIRONMENT SCANDAL: 'SHE KEPT ME GOING'_**\"A current employee told BuzzFeed News that on May 1, the same day the story about the former bodyguard was published, executive producers took the rare move of holding an all-staff meeting over Zoom to address the negative stories and low morale,\" the report said.Ten additional former employees of the long-running show spoke out anonymously to the outlet with additional nightmarish claims about what it's like working for DeGeneres and top producers.The ex-employees shared harrowing details of their day-to-day experiences working at \"Ellen,\" which included claims of racist remarks and directives from producers to not speak to DeGeneres should she be roaming the office off-air.Comedian Ellen DeGeneres' show was investigated by parent company WarnerMedia in 2020. (Getty Images)Days after the Buzzfeed report came out, the public interest in Ellen\u2019s workplace and personal demeanor led to an internal investigation. _Variety_ reported at the time that \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" was under investigation by parent company WarnerMedia. A memo was sent to the show\u2019s staffers announcing that a team had been assembled alongside a third-party organization to interview current and former employees about what was happening behind the scenes of the show. ** _ELLEN DEGENERES TELLS OPRAH WINFREY ABOUT EMOTIONAL MOMENT SHE TOLD STAFF SHOW WAS ENDING_**Things also took a turn when Buzzfeed News published another bombshell report alleging that producer Kevin Leman was guilty of alleged sexual misconduct. Ex-staffers claimed he solicited oral sex at a company party in 2013, while another ex-staffer claimed to have seen the exec grab a production assistant's penis on a different occasion. Another staff member claimed they saw Leman grope a production assistant and kiss his neck in a car.Nearly a dozen employees also stated that it was not unusual for Leman to make crude and sexual jokes in the office.Leman denied the allegations.Warner Bros. offered a statement to Fox News at the time, explaining that they \"take the recent allegations around the show\u2019s workplace culture very seriously.\"The statement explained that in order to \"determine the validity and extent of publicly reported allegations and to understand the full breadth of the show\u2019s day-to-day culture,\" many current and former employees were interviewed.Ellen first addressed her controversy in a letter to her staff. (Netflix)DeGeneres addressed the scandal for the first time in a letter to staff members that was obtained by _The Hollywood Reporter_. In it, she addressed the ongoing scandal and apologized to her staff and committed to doing better. **ELLEN DEGENERES ALREADY LINING UP A-LISTERS FOR FINAL SHOWS IN 2022: REPORT**\"On day one of our show, I told everyone in our first meeting that 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show' would be a place of happiness \u2013 no one would ever raise their voice, and everyone would be treated with respect,\" she began. \"Obviously, something changed, and I am disappointed to learn that this has not been the case. And for that, I am sorry. Anyone who knows me knows it\u2019s the opposite of what I believe and what I hoped for our show.\"DeGeneres continued, explaining that as the show has \"grown exponentially,\" she has had to turn to others to self-manage, which some employees did not do.\"That will now change and I\u2019m committed to ensuring this does not happen again,\" she stated.Ellen DeGeneres' show lost three producers following an investigation by WarnerMedia. (Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)A spokesperson for Warner Bros. confirmed to Fox News in August of 2020 that executive producers Ed Glavin and Kevin Leman and co-executive producer Jonathan Norman had been _let go from the show_ following the investigation. **ROSIE O'DONNELL SPEAKS OUT ABOUT 'ELLEN DEGENERES SHOW' ENDING, SAYS HOST WAS IN 'COMPLICATED' SITUATION**Staff learned of the situation by way of a virtual meeting that DeGeneres herself hosted.At the time, DeGeneres issued _a second apology_ to her staff in the video call that expanded on her letter. In it, she noted that she is not a perfect person.The _Emmy-winner_ added, \"I\u2019m hearing that some people felt that I wasn\u2019t kind or too short with them, or too impatient. I apologize to anybody if I\u2019ve hurt your feelings in any way.\"After handling the situation internally for so long it was finally time for DeGeneres to address the situation with her fans. In _the opening of Season 18_, which would end up being the show\u2019s second to last,\" DeGeneres dove in headfirst.\"As you may have heard, this summer there were allegations of a toxic work environment at our show and then there was an investigation. I learned that things happened here that never should have happened,\" she began.DeGeneres continued: \"I take that very seriously and I want to say I am so sorry to the people who were affected. I know that I'm in a position of privilege and power and I realized that with that comes responsibility, and I take responsibility for what happens at my show.\" **'ELLEN DEGENERES SHOW' STAFF SEEING 'SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT' 1 YEAR AFTER INVESTIGATION: SOURCES**\"This is 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show.' I am Ellen DeGeneres. My name is there, my name is there, my name is on underwear,\" the host joked. \"We have had a lot of conversations over the last few weeks about the show, our workplace and what we want for the future. We have made the necessary changes and today we are starting a new chapter.\"DeGeneres then addressed accusations that she is much different on-air than in person despite her pledge to \"be kind.\"\"There were also articles in the press and on social media that said that I am not who I appeared to be on TV, because I became known as the \u2018be kind\u2019 lady. And here's how that happened: I started saying, \u2018be kind to one another\u2019 after a young man named Tyler Clementi took his own life after being bullied for being gay,\" DeGeneres said.She added: \"I thought the world needed more kindness and it was a reminder that we all needed that, and I think we need it more than ever right now.\"\"Being known as the \u2018be kind\u2019 lady is a tricky position to be in. So let me give you some advice out there if anybody's thinking of changing their title or giving yourself a nickname, do not go with the \u2018be kind\u2019 lady. Don't do it,\" DeGeneres jokingly added.She took on a more serious tone as she said, \"The truth is I am that person that you see on TV. I am that person that you see on TV. I am also a lot of other things. Sometimes I get sad, I get mad, I get anxious, I get frustrated, I get impatient. I am working on all of that. I am a work in progress. I\u2019m especially working on the impatience thing, and it\u2019s not going well because it\u2019s not happening fast enough, I\u2019ll tell you that.\"Ellen DeGeneres' show will end with Season 19. (Reuters)After _bleeding viewers_ as a result of the scandal, Ellen announced that she had decided to end her talk show after Season 19.\"When you\u2019re a creative person, you constantly need to be challenged \u2013 and as great as this show is, and as fun as it is, it\u2019s just not a challenge anymore,\" she told _The Hollywood Reporter_ at the time.She later announced the news to her fans _on her show_. However, she saved the juiciest revealed for a sit-down interview with \" _Today_\" co-host Savannah Guthrie. The interview proved to be a bit of a setback for the star, who seemed to place the blame on critics rather than herself, as she\u2019d claimed to in her various apologies. ** _CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER_**\"I have to say, if nobody else is saying it, it was really interesting because I\u2019m a woman, and it did feel very misogynistic,\" _DeGeneres claimed at the time_.When anchor Guthrie asked if the Emmy-winner felt \"canceled,\" she responded, \"I mean, I really don\u2019t understand it. I still don\u2019t understand it. It was too orchestrated. It was too coordinated.\"DeGeneres said she felt confused and hurt above all.\"For me to read in the press about a toxic work environment when all I\u2019ve ever heard from every guest that comes on the show is what a happy atmosphere this is and what a happy place is,\" she said.DeGeneres noted that there are 255 employees that make up her show so she doesn't know \"how I could have known\" the alleged behavior was going on.\"There are a lot of different buildings. Unless I literally stayed here until the last person goes home at night, it is my name on the show so clearly it affects me and I might have to be the one to stand up and say, \u2018This can\u2019t be tolerated.' But I do wish someone came up to me and said, \u2018Hey, this is something you should know about.\u2019\"No, I do not have thick skin. I'm extremely sensitive to the point that this is not healthy how sensitive I am. When something is coming back at me that I know is not true, I guess I could take one or two of those shots but four months in a row took a toll on me,\" DeGeneres admitted.'The Ellen DeGeneres Show' has come under fire for it's toxic workplace, which has allegedly fostered racism and sexual misconduct. (NBC) ** _CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP_**Regardless of the controversy, DeGeneres is bowing out of TV, claiming that ending after Season 19 was the plan all along and that the controversy had nothing to do with it.\"I think 19 is a great number. One is the beginning and nine is the ending,\" she said, employing the sort of whimsical line she tosses off easily. _The Associated Press and Fox News\u2019 Nate Day and Melissa Roberto contributed to this report._#### Britney Spears shares message about being controlled, manipulated amid fight for freedom from conservatorship#### Fox News Flash top entertainment headlines for September 14#### All of the political fashion statements at Met Gala#### Debbie Harry wears patriotic dress at Met Gala 2021 to honor 'American Independence' theme#### 'The Price Is Right' celebrates Season 50, being the longest-running game show in TV history#### 5 stars who have rocked sheer looks on the red carpet  * Do Not Sell my Personal InformationThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92021 FOX News Network, LLC.

When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn moreBy  PC Gamer 13 September 2021PC Gamer's annual list of the 100 best games you should play right now.Every year, the global PC Gamer team gets together to decide the top 100 PC games. The process is simple: we take last year's list, propose a bunch of additions, tweaks and removals, and then hold a series of hours-long discussions going step-by-step through every suggestion. Sometimes there is shouting.There are a few guiding principles that we stick to when we put this list together. For example, we're always clear that this isn't a ranking of the greatest--or most important--PC games of all time, but rather the best ones to play right now. It's a reflection of all the brilliant experiences the industry has to offer in 2021. Yes, that includes some retro classics that hold up nicely, but it also means celebrating the impact of bold new releases. We also prefer to highlight the breadth and variety of the platform, and so we've limited ourselves to one game per series.But the most important principle is that it should reflect us as a team, and who we are as PC gamers. With lots of new additions to our crew since last year, that means some exciting changes to our list. Enjoy! **Released** March 25, 2013 | **Last position** 68(Image credit: Digital Extremes) **Steven:** Warframe has had some ups and downs over the last year, but it's still an innovative, strange, and absorbing MMO shooter unlike anything else on the PC. No other game comes close to doing what Warframe does--especially now that it has ship-to-ship space combat and a Shadow of Mordor-style Nemesis System. The amount of stuff to do in Warframe is positively mind-boggling. And with a major story expansion coming later this year, there's never been a better time to start playing. **Fraser:** I'm immediately lost whenever I return to Warframe, but the way it reinvents itself and keeps adding unexpected new features always keeps me coming back. I've not had a chance to grow bored of it yet. **Released** March 11, 2014 | **Last position** 99(Image credit: Blizzard) **Tim:** Hearthstone retains its place thanks to the triumph that is the Battlegrounds mode, which has surely overtaken Standard as the main reason to play. Smartly, Blizzard is pumping resources into BGs to keep the minion and hero pools fresh. It's also rolling out paid cosmetics (inevitably) to keep the accountants happy, but that feels reasonable given how good the BGs experience is. Building a lobby-dominating comp is like creating your own Rube Goldberg machine and letting it run riot. Even when the plan doesn't pan out, the feeling is of moreishness--a stark contrast to the despair of the ladder experience. **Alan:** Whole-hearthedly agree with Tim here--Hearthstone's ladder experience may be joy-sapping, but it more than makes up for those lows with variety. Battlegrounds are ridiculous, the weekly Tavern Brawls can be fantastically broken, Duels can be great (when not awash with over-tuned Quest decks), and Arena is just as random as it ever was. **Released** May 6, 2003 | **Last position** 71(Image credit: CCP Games) **Steven:** EVE Online has slipped down from last year's position largely because of a series of controversies involving microtransactions and economic rebalancing that players are not happy about. Since its release, EVE Online has struggled to invent systems that both enable its cataclysmically large battles while keeping a level playing field for both sides. This also isn't the first time EVE Online has landed in hot water with its players, and it won't be the last. But what's consistent through its highs and lows is EVE Online's singular ability to spark intergalactic drama in its crucible of player-driven war.Even now, EVE Online is in the midst of its most destructive conflict of all time as two sides of the galaxy wage war on each other. Fleet commanders have staged daring rescue attempts, desperate last stands, and cunning ambushes. Meanwhile, the rest of the galaxy pulses and thrums to the rhythm of hundreds of smaller conflicts erupting each and every day. That sense of existing in a living, breathing ecosystem with other players is something that no other MMO has, and your ability to build your own legacy in the ebb and flow of its player-driven empires is, to this day, remarkable. Even if EVE's complicated controls and steep learning curve turn you away, you should still take every opportunity to read about each new (and bloody) chapter its players are writing. **Released** September 17, 2020 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Monster Couch) **Rachel:** The most charming board game out there, and that includes both the physical and virtual versions. It's an engine-building card game where you play as bird enthusiasts trying to attract birds to your wildlife preserve. Each card has a bird fact and an illustration that has been wonderfully animated in the digital version. Definitely one to play with friends who like a laid-back approach to competitive card games. **Wes:** Bird facts! Wingspan's theme really is delightful. Beneath that is a modern classic \"easy to learn, hard to master\" strategy game, with tons of clever interplay between the different types of birds. My favorites are the predators, which can snatch other bird cards out of the deck for you to score points. So much of Wingspan is cleverly and delicately balanced to make it feel like your bird 'engine' is accelerating as you close in on the finish. The rounds get shorter towards the end, making each decision more meaningful. As you play more birds into each of your wildlife rows, they're all 'activated' each time you trigger the row, kicking off a cavalcade of activity like laying eggs (a key resource) or drawing more bird cards to expand your aviary. Almost every game of Wingspan I've played has ended in a nail-biter, a testament to how many viable strategies there are to win with. **Released** February 27, 2014 | **Last position** Re-entry(Image credit: Paradox Interactive) **Jody:** I didn't expect to recommend the cyberpunk RPG with elves, but here we are. Dragonfall may have a setting where dragons give up hoarding gold to become megacorp CEOs hoarding stock options, where a dwarf hacker mastercrafts software like a smith forging magic axes, but it understands the genre like few other games do (shout-out to Umurangi Generation and The Red Strings Club). It's explicitly anti-authoritarian, an entire game about about holding together an anarcho-state in Berlin. With elves.It's the best revivalist CRPG too. While Dragonfall doesn't push the subgenre as far as Divinity: Original Sin 2--it lifts a chunk of plot directly from Baldur's Gate 2--it modernises the isometric RPG with Mass Effect-style companions and XCOM-inspired combat. **Robin:** It's a great game--but I think I'd actually recommend Shadowrun: Hong Kong over it. It's got such a great setting and story, and feels a bit more polished mechanically. **Morgan:** I never got around to Hong Kong Robin, but if it's half as cool as Dragonfall, consider it the co-96th best PC game.## 95\\. Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun **Released** December 6, 2016 | **Last position:** 86(Image credit: Daedalic) **Fraser:** Desperados 3 is the newest tactics game from Mimimi Games, but 2016's Shadow Tactics remains my favourite thanks to the Edo setting and charismatic cast. It looks stunning, much more so than the Wild West, and by the end you won't want to say goodbye to your band of killer pals. And beyond that, it's still a superb, sneaky tactics game that encourages creativity, experimentation and, of course, save scumming. Bonus points for letting us use an adorable tanuki for murder. **Morgan:** I was super jazzed about the first two hours of Shadow Tactics, but then it got very hard and I tossed it in the bin. Tactical stealth movement works really great and I loved the gadgets, but I kind of wish it was turn-based like Invisible, Inc. **Phil:** Let's not revisit the real-time vs turn-based argument again--there's too much list left for us to start fighting now. For what it's worth, though, I think the Shadow Mode--which lets you pause the action to plan and synchronise your squad's next move--offers a nice middle ground.## 94\\. The House in Fata Morgana **Released** May 13, 2016 | **Last position:** New entry(Image credit: Novectacle) **Sarah:** I want to tell everyone to play this visual novel from Novectacle, and I've been spoiled for any similar games I've played since. It's made up of intertwined stories spanning various characters and time periods and takes you, the protagonist, on an often traumatic journey as you attempt to rediscover your identity. The clean and vibrant art style is pure screenshot fodder, and the soundtrack captures the mood within individual stories and scenes with haunting accuracy. The story starts out slowly but it gets darker and more intricate the further you progress, and depends on the decisions you make throughout. Fair warning though--the subject matter covered in Fata Morgana could be potentially triggering for some. **Jody:** I love the music and some of the art, but found the subject matter a bit much. Fata Morgana lays on tragedies with a trowel, especially sexual violence, until they lose impact. It's great to have a visual novel in the list, though. Especially now the ultimate entry-point, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, is on Steam.## 93\\. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines **Released** November 16, 2004 | **Last position** Re-entry(Image credit: Activision) **Jody:** If you went through a \"slightly too into vampires\" phase, Bloodlines is for you. An RPG made by people who played immersive sims, it turns you into a bloodsucker then turns you loose on the streets of LA. To survive you have to drink blood (in lush, spotlit scenes, the camera spinning round the act), and navigate vampire society (in dialogue with characters so expressive they make more recent games seem stiff). Its vampires are vintage manipulators, as much a danger to each other as their hunters are. You're given plenty of freedom in how you deal with them--enough rope to make your own noose. **Phil:** Given that the planned sequel doesn't seem to be happening, I guess we'll pop the original back in the list. Just make sure to download the fan-made patch before you play it. **Morgan:** I love a good immersive sim, but the further back I reach into the genre's history, the jankier they get. I'll give Bloodlines a shot one of these days.## 92\\. Command & Conquer Remastered Collection **Released** June 5, 2020 | **Last position** 90(Image credit: EA)**Phil:** The original Command & Conquer and Red Alert, lovingly packaged up and remastered. The clear care that's gone into the Remastered Collection's presentation gives you the space to focus on what's truly remarkable about these games: that, over a quarter of a century after their original release, they're still a hell of a lot of fun to play. The pacey campaign missions challenge you to wipe out your enemy with often limited resources, making full use of environmental features, special units and a weird and wonderful tech tree. It's a concentrated blast of everything that makes the RTS genre great.Actually, wait, that's only the second most remarkable thing about these games. The most remarkable thing is their music, which is given centre stage through the Remastered Collection's Jukebox feature. **Wes:** Phil, I can't believe you left out the behind-the-scenes videos showing the making of C&C's infamously campy FMV cutscenes. Any new footage of Joseph Kucan in-character as Kane is a gift to the universe. **Released** May 14, 2021 | **Last position** New Entry(Image credit: BioWare) **Jody:** The three good space opera RPGs jammed together, with less bugs, more DLC. What kind of space captain do you want to be? Your version of Commander Shepard's free to be a diplomat giving inspiring speeches, a badass punching first and shooting later, or a dreamboat smooching blue aliens.The first game starts strong, introducing a galaxy built on familiar sci-fi ideas, but with rad weird aliens too. It finishes strong as well, a run of missions building to a climax where you defeat an impossibly powerful invader. In the middle there's some padding where you drive across identikit planets, which is a shame. And the less said about the third game's ending, the better.Mass Effect Legendary Edition is mostly in this list for Mass Effect 2, the Goldilocks centrepiece that set plot aside to focus on character. Mass Effect 2 has you put together a crew of 12 squadmates who, like the universe they're in, build on familiar cliches taken to surprising places. Across missions that jump from undercover infiltration to action setpiece to mystery thriller you get to know your Dirty Dozen, and in choosing how you respond to their dilemmas, build a hero to lead them. By the end you feel so much ownership of your Shepard, you'll get confused by screenshots because the wrong character is in them. **Phil:** I've worked at PC Gamer for almost a decade now, which means my overriding memory of Mass Effect is us arguing which one should be included in the Top 100 each year. Finally, BioWare has put an end to that argument by releasing them all as one game. And for that reason alone, it should be celebrated. Also because the games are good--if increasingly showing their age. **Released** December 7, 2017 | **Last position** 49(Image credit: zachtronics) **Phil:** A puzzle game about building beautiful machines. You're tasked with creating alchemical compounds, using pistons and rotators to manipulate atoms into their desired form. But as much as the story has fun with the conceit, the real satisfaction of Opus Magnum comes from the process of engineering a solution. There is no one way to solve any of the game's problems, and that means every machine is inherently your own design. Your attempt may be inefficient, even inelegant, but you'll love it all the same. **Released** March 20, 2018 | **Last position** 78(Image credit: Rare) **Mollie:** I think I may be one of the last remaining Sea of Thieves likers on our team, and that's mostly because I'm a massive gremlin in the game. In no other situation is it socially acceptable for me to get absolutely trollied, vomit into a bucket and then douse my friends in my chunky goodness. Sailing the seas and plundering booty is fun and all, but drunkenly playing the concertina is the real reason I love this game so much. **Wes:** I love Sea of Thieves too, though I don't play it as much as I wish I did! I'd love to see Rare overhaul the sword combat system which is still deeply clunky, but it's probably still the best hangout game on PC. The Tall Tales are fantastic open-ended adventures. It's still a refreshing rarity in live service games to have a new mission you can just figure out, rather than having a checklist of tasks to complete that it holds your hand through.Though it does have one checklist I'm a sucker for. Someday I will catch every fish in the sea, even if it means I'm fishing off the back of a sinking ship while my crewmates frantically steer us through a storm. **Morgan:** I love everything Sea of Thieves is about, I just wish there was more of it--ships, weapons, maps, quest types, I need more! Then perhaps my friends and I would stop getting bored after our second night on the sea. **Phil:** 'More' would help, but I don't think it's the only answer. I think one of my biggest problems with Sea of Thieves is, for as good as the experience of sailing with a crew is, there isn't much beyond that to hold your attention. The ground combat isn't much fun, the progression systems are shallow, and the handful of fun activities don't hold up to intense repetition. It's a cool hangout game, as Wes says, but it would take a fairly major overhaul to persuade me to return. **Released** October 28, 2016 | **Last position** 11(Image credit: Titanfall 2) **Nat:** Titanfall 2 has seen better days. That campaign is still an all-timer (even if I probably don't rate it as highly as others), but the game really shone in multiplayer--and while there appears to be a brief respite from the hacking and DDOS problems that plagued its predecessor, it's a rock-hard game to get into this far after launch. **Morgan:** It breaks my heart that Titanfall 3 seems like a fantasy at this point. **Wes:** Hopefully those multiplayer problems will soon pass, since Titanfall 2 on Steam gives it a real shot at maintaining an active multiplayer community for the next few years. But really, I'm just here to keep beating that campaign drum: if you somehow still haven't played it and are in the mood for an FPS, this should be your first stop. **Fraser:** I was very vocal about putting Titanfall 2 on the list last year, so I'm obviously a bit disappointed that it's dropped from 11 to 88, but take it from me: this is the smartest, most surprising FPS here. The multiplayer is great, even though it's been dealing with those aforementioned issues, but the main reason to play this now is its unsurpassed campaign.   **Released** October 22, 2010 | **Last position** 87(Image credit: Bethesda) **Robin:** Obsidian's underdog-turned-critical-darling understands what Fallout should be in a way I don't think Bethesda ever have. A rich role-playing adventure whose intricate web of choices holds up brilliantly, even if its visuals don't. **Chris:** It's so deep that no matter how many times you've played, there are still new choices to make. **Jody:** The Old World Blues add-on brings Fallout back to its roots, a delirious mash-up of raygun sci-fi and Mad Max. I still don't think any Fallout after the first one has really nailed its theme as well as the original did, but in Old World Blues and a few other questlines, New Vegas came close. **Fraser:** Old World Blues is a cracker, but even without its expansions New Vegas is the best Fallout, and the only one I'd recommend to most players today. It's never felt like Bethesda really gets Fallout, and while 3 was really good, it still felt like an adaptation or spin-off rather than the main course. Given that, New Vegas will probably continue to be the best game in the series for a long time, unless Bethesda gives up the reins again.## 86\\. What Remains of Edith Finch **Released** April 25, 2017 | **Last position** 26(Image credit: Annapurna Interactive) **Rachel:** It may have fallen a fair way down in our top 100 list, but What Remains of Edith Finch is still a powerhouse of storytelling. It's an anthology of stories set in the Finch household where exploring each room helps you discover more about the eccentric family and their lives. **Wes:** Going into What Remains of Edith Finch, I didn't expect how fantastical and imaginative it would be with every story it tells. For a game about the history of a family it's endlessly inventive; you're not just looking around a musty old house and getting some voiceover about the objects you see. Edith Finch manages to convey the humanity and tragedy of the family through dream sequences and animal transformations; bits of history that seem separate at first slowly blossom into a family tree and finally connect to your character in the present. It's really stuck with me for a game that I played in just a couple hours. **Morgan:** Don't even talk to me about the cannery. **Released** November 23, 2004 | **Last position** 43(Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment) **Sarah:** I'll always love World of Warcraft but I've struggled with motivation to log in since the launch of Shadowlands. We went from being ridiculously overpowered in BFA to power systems that feel like they were tacked on as an afterthought. I'm still there and still raiding, but even that feels more like a chore the further into the expansion we go. **Steven:** World of Warcraft is still such an influential game, but yeah, it feels like it's in the midst of a serious identity crisis. If you've never played it, it's still an enormous and enjoyable experience, but my god is Shadowlands starting to feel like a big disappointment. At least WoW Classic is trucking along just fine (assuming you're not into PvP). **Fraser:** I've finally managed to get WoW out of my system. It just took 15 years. It's one of the most important games ever made, and it's exceptional that it remains not only alive but massively popular after such a long time, but I think I've put enough time into it now. And frankly I'm not sure I can really separate it from what we now know about Blizzard, and what a terrible work environment management has fostered. **Phil:** Thanks to magazine lead times, this list was locked down in early Summer, before the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a lawsuit against Activision Blizzard alleging discrimination and sexual harrasment. Even before that, it only just about managed to hang on--the team increasingly down on Blizzard's direction for the game. If we were to make this right now, I don't think it would be here at all. **Released** May 13, 2020 | **Last position** 34(Image credit: Metalhead) **Chris:** The Super Mega Baseball series has always been a fun and cartoony on-field baseball game, but SMB3 added tons of depth when it comes to making your randomly generated players memorable. Their skills can be enhanced during a season or fade over time as they grow, age, and eventually retire. The player system gives your team a feeling of continuity over multiple seasons, and SMB3 continues to take away the sting of MLB: The Show not being on PC. **Released** October 6 2014 | **Last position** 27(Image credit: Sega) **Andy K:** In the seven years since Isolation was released, I haven't encountered a single game--horror or otherwise--with an enemy as convincingly, terrifyingly intelligent as its xenomorph. It's wild no one tried to top it. Maybe they just couldn't. Creative Assembly created something really special here: a big budget game based on a major Hollywood property that is intelligent, subversive, and systematically interesting. It's a great stealth game, a genre-defining horror experience, and the stylish retro-future aesthetic, inspired by the 1979 movie, makes it, still, one of the prettiest games on PC. In terms of game design, art, audio, and atmosphere, it's a masterpiece. The story doesn't quite stack up with everything else, but it has some great moments--particularly the heartfelt message from Ellen Ripley to her daughter, which Sigourney Weaver plays beautifully. There will never be a better Alien game. **Fraser:** Just popping my yearly update in here. Nope, still not very far into it. Yep, hoping I will eventually finish it. It's brilliant, but I'm still too scared of xenomorphs to make much progress. One day, though! One day.**Released** April 29, 2020 | **Last position** 84(Image credit: Riot Games) **Robin:** It speaks to my love for Riot's online CCG that I keep talking about it even though it makes Hearthstone-loving Tim Clark want to fire me. It's gone from strength to strength this year, introducing exciting new cards and a brilliant solo mode, while continuing to stick to its remarkably generous take on a free-to-play business model, which still lets you easily craft the decks you want without paying a penny. It has had some wobbles recently--including a chaotic meta and some controversial cosmetics--but refreshing transparency and bold action from the dev team gives confidence that they're listening. In some ways it does still feel like a game that's growing and finding its feet - but considering it's already so good, that potential is nothing but hugely exciting. **Steven:** Frankly, I'm shocked that it's 2021 and one of my favorite games is a card game. You'd think after so many games there'd be no room for a new one to swoop in and innovate, but Legends of Runeterra continues to be brilliant. Robin talks a lot about its new stuff, but part of what keeps me coming back is just how wonderful the foundation it is built upon is. It's just a shame that it seems like Runeterra's curse is that it will continue to be criminally overlooked by so many players. **Released** January 31, 2019 | **Last position** 82(Image credit: Failbetter) **Fraser:** Spaceships? Passe. Space locomotives? Now we're talking. Sunless Skies makes you brave the dangers of space while inside a train full of troubled crewmates, usually starving and being driven round the bend. Part trading sim, RPG and exploration romp, it's all weird, and elevated by the best videogame writing around. The great game has also been made better, recently, thanks to the far-ranging Sovereign Edition update, throwing new characters, trains and stories into the already dense mix.   **Released** April 28, 2020 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Saber Interactive) **Dave:** It's zen trucking. Slowly churning through the mud with some tunes as your only company for miles. Super chill. Until you roll your rig down the side of a mountain, of course **Morgan:** Snowrunner is the mud trucking sim of my dreams. It's Death Stranding without all the drama and ghost babies: just you, your truck, and the stack of pipes that need to get to the top of this mountain. Snowrunner is no tranquil driving sim. Every job is a battle against nature itself and your weapons are wheels, winches, and will. In the year since launch, Snowrunner has only gotten bigger and better with quality DLC and a vibrant modding community. **Released** June 2, 2020 | **Last position:** 94(Image credit: Riot Games) **Evan:** Replicating the weapon set, map philosophy, and beautiful rhythm of Counter-Strike is some sort of scientific cloning accomplishment. Valorant is its own game, though, one with meaningful technical advancements (it'll give you 90 fps on a graphing calculator, practically) and magical character abilities that let you and your opponent make counter-punches with utility as you compete for precious positioning. **Phil:** I recently dipped back in with some pals after about a year away, and, oh boy, Valorant is a punishing game to return to. But after a couple of demoralising losses, our third match--a nail biting 13-12 win--was one of the most exciting multiplayer experiences I've had this year. **Released** February 25, 2015 | **Last position** 85(Image credit: Gearbox) **Nat:** Homeworld's tragic space opera is timeless, but its original release is a little less so. Thankfully, the Remastered Collection is still a fantastic way to experience a truly singular, unique spacefaring RTS--with a healthy modding scene that lets you recreate fleet battles from Star Trek to Mass Effect. **Fraser:** There's no other RTS with this much style and grace. Homeworld is a spaceship ballet and epic tragedy that I never thought would be replicated--how could it be? Homeworld 3 is coming, but will it live up to the impossibly lofty expectations set by its predecessors? Spin-off Deserts of Kharak certainly got close, but there's magic in those first two games that sets them apart. We'll see. **Released** March 8, 2018 | **Last position** 74(Image credit: Fatshark) **Robin:** The leading light of Left 4 Dead's many imitators, trading guns and zombies for rich melee combat and a wonderfully well-realised take on the horror and humour of the Warhammer Fantasy setting. The new (free) Chaos Wastes expansion is a treat, too--a wild, co-op roguelike mode that's full of surprises. **Wes:** I've returned to Vermintide this year and especially appreciate how each character plays so differently. My first time through I stuck to up-close-and-personal dwarf Bardin Goreksson, but lately I've played as battle mage Sienna, standing back and flamethrowing legions of low-level ratlings. The equipment system still kinda feels like fluff, but I love that each character has three classes that play differently, and styles of weapons that add even more granularity. This is the co-op game to beat, even three years in. **Fraser:** Great rats. The best rats. Very squishy. **Released** July 15, 2015 | **Last position** 59(Image credit: Freehold Games) **Steven:** Caves of Qud is a near-perfect middle ground between the daunting complexity of classic roguelikes and the mind-boggling simulation of Dwarf Fortress. It's also the weirdest RPG I've ever played. Sentient beanstalks, tinker bears, space-time paradoxes, fungal infections--it's almost impossible to describe Qud in a way that makes sense. Each time you start a new game, an entire world (complete with its own cultures and history) is generated for you to uncover. And within that space, you can play as anything from a desert nomad to a cybernetically enhanced half-man-half-tank. Just play it. **Wes:** I've still barely just dipped my toe in Caves of Quid during Early Access, but it really was staggering; it feels like someone took on the mad idea of cramming RPG-style writing into the open-ended structure of NetHack, and actually pulled it off. Along with Disco Elysium, I think Caves of Qud is a modern reminder that good enough writing can make any game utterly captivating.## 75\\. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim **Released** November 11, 2011 | **Last position** 60(Image credit: Bethesda) **Harry:** What else is left to say about Skyrim? Nothing, really. A decade on The Elder Scrolls V is a fixture in the PC gaming consciousness despite looking janky and dated, even with a choice selection of mods.Skyrim slips down the Top 100 again this year, but don't expect it to be forgotten anytime soon. Speaking of, The Forgotten City, based on a Skyrim mod has just come out, so it remains to be seen if it makes next year's list. **Jody:** In my current playthrough I have my own museum, a chainsword, and fabulous hair. The music's replaced by dark ambient and Nordic folk-metal, there are gallows and gibbets everywhere, and I have to periodically wash off blood and travel dirt. I'm accompanied by two characters from Vermintide, a blue khajiit, and the Skyrim Grandma.The Special Edition means Skyrim handles ridiculous mod loads without instability, and I can alt-tab as much as I want without it crashing. It's better than ever. I'll be tired of Skyrim when I'm tired of life. **Mollie:** Skyrim is one of those games that's been there for me through a ton of high and low points in my life. Will I ever branch out and play anything other than a stealthy archer? Hell no, but I will spend hours exploring the same old dinky caves and loading up my house with an unnecessary number of stolen books. **Released** June 1, 2017 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Bandai Namco) **Mollie:** I've played my fair share of fighting games over the years, but few have kept me coming back in the way Tekken 7 does. Every hit, block and sidestep feels so intensely satisfying to me. Couple that with a banging soundtrack, cinematic ultimate moves and a heart-pounding dramatic slow-mo cam, and every match feels like a full-blown theatrical performance.Though I still lament the lack of Christie Monteiro in the game, the roster is solid. Lucky Chloe has quickly become a series favourite for me, and wild DLC characters like The Walking Dead's Negan and Final Fantasy 15's Noctis just work somehow. Tekken 7 is easily the best 3D fighter out there right now, and my favourite fighting game in recent memory. **Graeme:** Echoing Mollie, Tekken 7 is an easy fighting game Hall of Fame contender, but it's also a love letter to long term fans, tying-up the soap opera in a perfectly melodramatic fashion. As we're introduced to Kazumi Mishima, wife to Heihachi, she immediately instructs Akuma from Street Fighter (yeah) to kill her husband if she fails to do it herself. Also Yoshimitsu is an alien, I guess?It's the bombastic combat, which puts players in the action more than any other game, that makes Tekken so addictive. But it's the series' unflinching commitment to it's character's lore and personalities that makes me love Tekken.   **Released** February 2, 2016 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: SCS Software) **James:** Pool Noodle, this is Ham Hock--we've got American Truck Simulator coming up on the left, taking point. Euro Truck Sim can take a breather. This son of a gun's packing Texas and Idaho, on the way to pick up Wyoming. You ever drive through through 'em? Vast, empty spaces. Buttes and scrub. Flimsy barbwire between state, federal, and private land. A couple mountain ranges in the western halves, Idaho panhandle too. Feeling that small centers a person. Kanye West lives in Wyoming. A recent multiplayer update means you can drive by Kayne's yard with a friend. Nothing eases the weight of a heavy load, on the truck and the soul, like a convoy. Steady breath, eyes ahead. We'll get to where we're going. Over. **Andy K:** ATS is great. I love driving through the desert at night, tumbleweed rollin' across my headlights, roadside diners glowing in the dark. But my heart belongs to Euro Truck Simulator 2. The larger map has a lot more variety, from the mountains of Norway to the vineyards of France, making for much more exciting road trips. **Released** March 10, 2015 | **Last position** 32(Image credit: Paradox) **Fraser:** Cities: Skylines continues its reign, with few urban city builders appearing to steal its crown. It remains undefeated in part because of the dearth of competition, but the many DLC additions and huge list of mods have ensured that even after five years it still has plenty to offer would-be mayors. There's even an expansion exclusively dedicated to parks. And it turns out that flooding cities with poo doesn't get old. Sorry, citizens! **Phil:** The city building genre has had something of a resurgence thanks to games like Frostpunk and Anno 1800 offering up a different take on the basic formula. But if you want the best game to actually build a city in, here it is. **Katie:** I don't think I'll ever get tired of creating vast intertwined city-scapes, ever more intricate intersections, and long-ass roundabouts\u2026 so many roundabouts they permeate my dreams. Help, I'm traffic managing in my sleep. **Released** September 1, 2015 | **Last position** 43(Image credit: Konami Digital Entertainment) **Wes:** MGS5 is a dramatic departure from previous Metal Gear, which is what I love about it. After the on-rails nonsense of the intro, it pretty much sets you free to be the ultimate spy in an amazing sandbox. Maybe Ubisoft hasn't made a new Splinter Cell yet because it doesn't know how to do it better than The Phantom Pain. **Rich:** Simply one of the best games ever made, a unique take on open world design, and absolutely rammed with things to do. This feels like the game Metal Gear Solid was always building towards: ignore the nonsense about it being unfinished, and enjoy the finest game Kojima Productions ever made. **Phil:** It's let down slightly by a handful of missions that force you to fight the Parasite Unit--tedious battles that ignore almost all of the established rules of the game. The rest of the time, though, MGS 5 drops you onto the map with a handful of gadgets and lets you figure things out for yourself. One of the most satisfying stealth sandboxes you can play. **Dave:** Was having an absolute blast with MGS5's open world; it felt solid, real, and deliciously brutal. But as soon as it got fully into the bloated, ridiculous exposition it immediately pulled me out of the game world and that has meant I can't face going back ever again. **Released** April 24, 2018 | **Last position** 64(Image credit: 11 bit studios) **Fraser:** Few management games have made me feel like such a monster, but that's what happens when you become a fascist to save a few lives and they freeze to death anyway. The cold and desperation makes you cold and desperate. Frostpunk is a challenging apocalyptic city builder with plenty of engaging systems, but it's the high stakes and brutal consequences of your decisions that makes it special. And thanks to the DLC, you can also see what life was like just before the big freeze. Spoiler: it was miserable. **Chris:** I remember getting absolutely furious when my city was running well, I was keeping everyone warm and fed, and I had enough resources to survive, but my citizens were still miserable because they'd heard some rumor that tanked their morale. It seemed so unfair that I'd done everything right but people still hated me. But then it's a society simulator, isn't it? No matter what you do, you can't make everyone happy, and a portion of any society is going to be filled with people who simply won't use logic or listen to reason. A relevant lesson! **Released** September 12, 2013 | **Last position** 44(Image credit: Bohemia Interactive) **Evan:** Is Arma a tedious and complicated sim, or a peerless sandbox-playground for unscripted military antics? Years into its lifespan, the franchise's contradiction is potent: onboarding someone into the game means handing them a list of mods they 'absolutely' need to get started and a longer list of unusual keybinds (double tap left Alt to freely swivel your neck independently of your weapon, duh). But at the end of that not-so-basic training awaits a serious and often silly game about riding in a helicopter with a dozen of your closest Discord friends, one of whom crashes that helicopter into a tree after failing to correctly engage the auto-hover. **Released** October 29, 2020 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Tuxedo Labs) **Nat:** Remember the first time you took a sledgehammer to a house in Red Faction Guerrilla? Teardown is that, but pushed to its best extreme. A destruction sandbox where breakable buildings aren't just a backdrop to mediocre gunfights, but instead used to prop up an incredible set of heist puzzles.But oh, that smashing! Teardown may be voxelated, but everything breaks as you'd expect. Wood buckles under pressure. Plaster cracks to reveal underlying brickwork. Fire spreads as volumetric smoke billows through hallways, and a remarkably efficient approach to ray-tracing makes sure it all looks perfectly tactile.In most levels, you're free to explore and destroy the map as you see fit. You'll have a set number of items to rob (briefcases, safes, cars), and once you snag one, the timer starts. Carve an optimal route through the map, grab the goods, and make it out before the cops arrive. Simple, but nerve-wrackingly brilliant.Beyond that, though, Teardown's exploding mod scene has turned the voxel playground into a brand new Garry's Mod. There's a workshop packed to the brim with new maps to smash up, and a wealth of toys ranging from GMod-style physics guns to miniguns akimbo. Teardown's puzzles are decent fun, but I'll be smashing my way through fan-made maps for a long time yet. **Released** August 8, 2018 | **Last position** 57(Image credit: Wadjet Eye Games) **Fraser:** Wadjet Eye's best adventure game also borrows a lot from great RPGs. A supernatural mystery, Unavowed throws you into an ancient society of magical problem solvers after a possession ruined your life. It's got big party-based RPG vibes, evoking BioWare games especially, complete with special origin stories and a branching plot that goes to some surprising places.But this is still firmly a 2D point-and-click, where most of your time will be spent solving mysteries and puzzles. And what excellent mysteries and puzzles they are, forcing you to use both magic and your investigative chops to solve. What lingers, though, are the charming characters and Unavowed's vision of New York--a place simultaneously familiar and utterly alien. **Robin:** Unavowed feels like a treatise on how the classic style of 2D adventure game can still feel relevant in the modern games industry. It's a throwback, but it's not relying on retro nostalgia--it has bold new ideas for how the genre can evolve without losing its distinctive heart. **Released** November 23, 2020 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Sega) **Dave:** We finally made it, ma! Football Manager is in the PC Gamer top 100, rightfully taking a place in the pantheon of PC greatness. As the finest long-term RPG on any platform, I'd argue it's a bit too far down the list, but there are still many who foolishly see it as some sort of glorified spreadsheet. Football is obviously central to the game, which does put people off. But FM is a mix of a sporting version of The Sims, marshalling and developing your little computer people to kick a ball about better than other little computer people, and a heart-wrenching RPG about success, failure, heroism, the fragility of youth, lost potential, and the inevitable decay of our own corporeal forms. **Released** June 25, 2013 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Relic) **Fraser:** Finally! I've been trying to get CoH2 in here for years. The RTS sequel is perhaps a controversial choice, and is certainly more divisive than its predecessor, but the first game has had its time in the sun and on this list. There are plenty of reasons to recommend the sequel, too, especially if you're tired of the Western Front. One of the main reasons I've been fighting for the swap is the fantastic Ardennes Assault expansion, which features a dynamic turn-based campaign--something Relic is taking even further in the upcoming Company of Heroes 3.   **Dave:** Still think the original is better, but that's probably because I got proper obsessed with the Commando units from the Opposing Fronts expandalone. **Released** October 2, 2018 | **Last position** 36(Image credit: Playground Games) **James:** Forza Horizon 4 has helped me understand why James Spader makes loves to his car in Crash. Cars are cool and hot and Horizon 4 knows it. Play it as a racing simulation or turn on all the assists and play it like Lego Racer. Or just deck out a van with a Dragonball Z livery and drive it off cliff sides, capturing the poetic footage as it tumbles. **Nat:** Forza lets me tear down my own backyard in the big daft Halo jeep, which makes it the best racing game ever made as far as I'm concerned. **Fraser:** I drove around digital Edinburgh with a friend and pointed out all the places I'd thrown up when I was at university. Perfect game. **Rich:** I just love that you can have a race in transit vans. **Jacob:** With a decent racing wheel, this game makes you feel like you're the world rally champion and F1 drivers champion all at the same time. **Released** April 19, 2011 | **Last position** 47(Image credit: Valve) **James:** A game that bends the rules of space also exists outside of time. Portal 2 is still one of the funniest games ever made. Even if the portal puzzles get easier to parse with every run, I'm always finding new routes and accidentally developing speedrun strats, buoyed by good humor, great performances, and excellent tunes throughout. If you've yet to play the co-op campaign, do it now. Spec out incredibly complex solutions to simple problems, together. **Harry:** If you like jokes, games, and puzzles, Portal 2 is essential. It's not a looker by today's standards, of course, but it doesn't need to be. Cleverness, invention, and laughs win over graphics any day. Plus, it'll probably run nicely on your Steam Deck. **Wes:** Has any voiceover in the past decade surpassed JK Simmons as Cave Johnson? It's outrageous that Portal 2 has puzzles that make you feel so smart while you're solving them and monologues so funny they make you cackle the whole time you're doing it. True galaxy brain stuff. **Released:** April 16, 2019 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Ubisoft) **Phil:** Ubisoft's trade-focused city builder has grown into something remarkable. Over a handful of DLC seasons it's doubled down on the satisfaction of seeing a territory grow by adding a handful of new regions with specific quirks to overcome. In Africa, you'll create canal systems to irrigate the land. In the Arctic, you'll build airships to circumnavigate imposing glaciers. And back in Europe, you'll expand your docks into a global hub supporting your ever-expanding trade empire. The sheer joy of turning these disparate regions into a fully-autonomous machine of growth and profit is hard to beat, at least until you move to the next tier of technology, and balk at the exponential effort required to get it up and running. A return to form for the series. **Released** September 17, 2019 | **Last position** 55(Image credit: Creature Studios) **Nat:** Tony Hawk might've introduced me to skateboarding, but Session understands why I've come to love it. There are no time limits and no high scores: just you, your board, and an urban sandbox to destroy.Session manages to make the simple act of rolling around on your skateboard feel incredible. Controls can be tweaked to be as easy or tough as possible, and it's rare that a game can make the humble ollie feel satisfying. Challenges that'd be trivial in THPS become hour-long battles as you try to nail a nollie heelflip into a lipslide off the sidewalk.Admittedly, Session is still extremely work-in-progress. Character models are a bit jank, animations bug out, and the physics are often hilariously broken. But each new update brings a new way to express your skating style, whether it's the introduction of freestyle primo and casper tricks, or a new city block featuring iconic skate spots. **James:** Normally, I'd hold back on recommending an early access game, but Session's impressive growth and momentum easily make up for the jank. We've already had a total physics overhaul and an animation overhaul is on the way. New trick systems and levels show up every couple months, and with new publisher Nacon on board, we might see Session pick up even more speed on the way to 1.0. **Released** March 4, 2021 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Devolver Digital, Four Quarters) **Harry:** Don't be put off by Loop Hero's impenetrable-seeming aesthetic; It's one of the most accessible games I've played in 2021. Its nostalgic style belies an absorbing adventure that's wonderfully simple to start, but brutal to master.You decide the difficulty of your nameless knight's journey by adding monster tiles for more gear and resources, or helpful boons, colouring in the blackness with often surprising results. Take your resources or try for one more loop? For much of 2021 I've struggled to choose. **Evan:** As you said, it's steeped in nostalgia, starting with that CRT \"curved screen\" filter you can enable in the main menu. And yet it's so different from many of the outwardly nostalgia-based games we see. Loop Hero isn't a 1:1 recreation of an old style of game like Stardew Valley. Instead it resurrects the spiritual aspects from the late '80s VGA era, the subtler sense of mystery found in some games from that era. It's most fun if you avoid Googling your way to victory with wikis. Instead, try engaging in the kinds of school lunchroom rumors with a friend who's also playing it, trading stories about how you can summon harpies into the map by building a mountain, or the ridiculous thing you have to do to get a secret boss to spawn. **Fraser:** I started playing Loop Hero because I thought it would be a distillation of RPG adventures that took only a wee while to play through. 50 hours later and I was still figuring out new tricks and playing one of my favourite games of the year. **Released** September 4, 2020 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Kaizen Gameworks) **Morgan:** Paradise Killer takes the most classically compelling premise in literary history (there's been a murder, you have to solve it) and places it in one of the strangest, most interesting videogame worlds I've ever explored. Piecing together timelines and motives while interrogating characters named Doctor Doom Jazz or Lydia Day Break never gets old. It's a visual novel for people that don't think they'd be into visual novels. A true sleeper hit. **Andy K:** What makes it really special for me is its openness. This is a detective game where you can find evidence in any order and construct your case at your own pace. The order you find these clues in--and the conclusions you draw from them--can totally reshape your perception of the crime and who did it, including pinning the crime on an innocent person and having to live with your shoddy detective work. **Released** April 23, 2021 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Torn Banner Studios/Tripwire Entertainment) **Fraser:** Chivalry 2 lets you chop off someone's limbs, pick them up, and then use them to beat someone else to death--all while you're screaming, they're screaming, everyone just won't stop screaming. They're really screams of joy, though, because this multiplayer medieval combat romp is just so damn fun. **Tyler:** It's great. I love the balance of serious sword combat and silliness, where swing selection and mouse technique are being carefully considered just a few feet away from players who are smashing the 'yell' key repeatedly and chucking objects into the fray like Philadelphia sports fans. In places, Chiv 2 really delivers on the full medieval warfare experience it promises. Climbing up a ladder and over the edge of a rampart is always thrilling. I can't wait for the horse update. **Evan:** It's the closest thing to a toxicity-proof competitive game I've played. The slapstick dark comedy of severed limbs and fish-as-weapons is part of it--that stuff makes Chivalry 2 feel lighthearted--but I also think that, unlike the serious, methodical, 5v5 formats in games like CS:GO, you sort of accept that a fray of dozens of people swinging their variously-long metal dicks around is going to be a messy affair. Balance isn't the point. It's the calamity and fun of facing down three knights in an \"unfair\" fight and somehow walking away, and then laughing it off when a ballista pegs your body against the castle wall. More competitive multiplayer games could learn from that. **Released** April 14, 2015 | **Last position** 50(Image credit: Rockstar Games) **Wes:** GTA Online's heists are still some of the most intricate co-op gaming you can do today. Rockstar's online infrastructure is terrible, though. **Morgan:** Yep, finally completing GTA Online's big Doomsday heist will go down in the history books of my friend group. Unfortunately, so will all the hackers and griefers that tried to ruin our fun. **Phil:** GTA Online tends to get all the attention these days, but there's a quality campaign here too--huge in scope, albeit saddled with some of Rockstar's most cynical writing to-date. The mod scene is _wild_ , too. **Released** September 28, 2020 | **Last position** New Entry(Image credit: miHoYo) **Steven:** It's still wild to me that Genshin Impact basically came out of nowhere and rocked the gaming world. And in the time since its launch, Genshin Impact has rapidly grown in a way that no MMO ever could. Player housing, new territories, and a bunch of new characters--it's crazy how good this free game is. **Morgan:** Technically free, yea. Its gacha money making tactics were overbearing enough to turn me off, and I'm the lucky type that's not compelled to keep spending money. **Steven:** I mean, it doesn't gate your progress in any way. You only have to spend the money if you want to, and there's no banners or pop-ups pestering you either. **Mollie:** I get you Morgan, gacha games can be off-putting with their monetisation. But I view Genshin Impact like a monthly MMO subscription--a little bit of money each month for some currency or extra goodies is no more than what I'd pay to play Final Fantasy 14.I hadn't actually played Genshin for a few months when we made this list, but I recently got back into it with the release of 2.0 and hoo boy, it's got me hooked straight back in. Just like Steven said, I can't believe this is a game that you can technically play free of charge. Teyvat is a gorgeous world, with each region bringing its own unique flavour and culture. Combat is seriously satisfying, too--combining the different elemental abilities of characters and firing off all manner of reactions never stops being fun. Sure it's a little grindy sometimes, but what live service game isn't these days? **Released** May 5, 2017 | **Last position** 56(Image credit: Arkane Studios) **James:** I bounced off Prey a couple of times, but once I accepted that you're always on the back foot it clicked. This is Resident Evil in space, but you choose what kind of key you want to unlock the next door with: hacking, secret vent pathways, or turning into a banana and sliding through a tiny hole in the wall. **Jody:** Prey's space station being a contiguous space, one you explore inside and out so thoroughly it's ridiculous, makes it the System Shock 3 of my dreams. You can hop into space, jetting around in zero-gravity to find alternate routes. You can find every single member of the crew, even finding the character sheets of the D&D group on board and then a recording of their game. There's so much detail, so much to learn. You can shoot a NERF crossbow through a window to hit a computer screen to read an email in a locked room. Why isn't this higher? **Phil:** It's no Dishonored 2, but I really have to praise the craft Arkane put into creating Prey's space station--a seamlessly connected environment full of secrets to unlock. It's just a shame the combat outstays its welcome. **Released** October 23, 2013 | **Last position** 51(Image credit: Grinding Gear Games) **Fraser:** This is the only action-RPG I think about. For years it's been evolving and spitting out experiments, beckoning me back time and time again to slaughter hordes of monsters and obsess over loot and builds. The main progression system is the pinnacle of ARPG character building, and one that's kept me tinkering away for the better part of a decade. I suspect only the in-development sequel will be able to tear me away. **Released** March 21, 2019 | **Last position** 6(Image credit: From Software) **Wes:** I don't want to start a debate about game difficulty, but overcoming Sekiro's challenge was a thrill I haven't gotten from an action game since God Hand. It demands you play on its terms. Without the flexibility of Dark Souls' RPG systems, you simply have to master the blade. The moment you parry a boss's final hit and counter with a deathblow you'll realize you've felt dead inside for years. **James:** I prefer From's RPGs, but nothing's gonna best Sekiro's take on sword combat for a long time. **Morgan:** Come on James, Chivalry 2 is right over there. Sekiro is hands-down my favorite From game yet. By reining in its combat options and focusing on a single weapon, they ended up with combat so good that Star Wars copied it. **Released** November 10, 2020 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Ubisoft) **Fraser:** Yes, it's more Assassin's Creed, with a vast open world filled with stuff to climb, people to murder and crap to collect. While much is unchanged, I still found myself spending something like 150 hours playing. As a Scot I hate to say it, but England is a pretty nice place to explore. It's a stunning open world, and one jam-packed with some of the series' most charismatic denizens, not least of which is Eivor, a terse but charming protagonist whose growls and sighs speak volumes. She's my favourite assassin, even over the superb Kassandra. **Sarah:** I absolutely adored Eivor, and her horse (who I named Horace). We both spent far too much time exploring England to compare places I've visited with their in-game counterparts. I'm still slightly jealous that Andy K came up with the Jorvik/York comparison article before I'd thought of it. **Steven:** I'm such a big fan of this new direction Assassin's Creed has taken--even if it sometimes still feels a little too big for its own good. Shifting to become an RPG with a branching narrative is just such a fun way to intimately explore a romanticized version of different historical periods, and Valhalla makes some really strong improvements in the narrative department, especially in the complex relationship between Eivor and her brother. **Robin:** You do just want Ubisoft to reign these games in a bit at this point, but I think it's really underappreciated just how tremendous an achievement they are. Valhalla's world is even more impressive than Odyssey's was, just quality and depth on an unbelievable scale. I wish these were games I felt like I could actually finish, but even still I've been having such a blast just setting out across England on my horse whenever the fancy takes me. **Phil:** Gonna be honest: I'm still too burned out from completing Odyssey--which, to be clear, I loved--to even consider starting this yet. **Released** March 6, 2020 | **Last position** 63(Image credit: Crowbar Collective) **Nat:** For a long time, Black Mesa was a joke. An over-ambitious attempt to completely remake Half-Life from the ground up as a standalone mod. But lo and behold, it's finally finished--and bloody hell, if it isn't a stunning thing. Black Mesa deftly reimagines Valve's 1998 debut, trimming the more tedious parts of Half-Life while remaking Xen (Half-Life's notoriously flawed final chapters) from the ground up. I wouldn't say it replaces the seminal shooter outright, but it's a damn fine way to experience it from a brand new angle. **Released** March 19, 2019 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Coffee Stain) **Wes:** A factory building game so perfectly named I defy anyone to talk about it without using the word \"satisfying.\" It can't be done! My first 'factory' was a messy series of conveyor belts on a forest floor that was ugly and inefficient, so I tore it down and rebuilt. And again. And again. My multiplayer crew is now building towering skyscraper factories linked by automated sky trains. Some people lose a year building castles in Minecraft; I lost one building iron rods in Satisfactory, and I don't regret a second of it. **Released** April 25, 2015 | **Last position** 40(Image credit: Private Division) **Phil:** Build rockets and send them into space. Or, just as likely, fail to send them into space because of a disastrous flaw with your design. Kerbal Space Program takes all of the complicated maths needed to successfully hurl functional machines out of a planet's atmosphere and presents them in a way that celebrates creativity, expression and fun. There's still nothing quite like Kerbal. **Dave:** The rescue missions Kerbal's 'career mode' spits up are some of the greatest space-based experiences you can have on a PC. Forget Elite: Dangerous, forget Homeworld, forget the Outer Wilds, when you've got Kerbward Woodward stranded, orbiting a distant planet with vast amounts of precious 'science' accumulated from a daring mission to Duna you've just got to figure out a way to get him home safe. Especially because it's your fault for him being stuck way out there because you forgot to add a few solar extra solar cells back in the lab. From creating the rescue craft, intercepting the stranded craft, and finally getting everyone home safe\u2026 there are few more satisfying feelings in PC gaming. **Released** September 29, 2020 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Mossmouth) **Evan:** Depth, literally and figuratively. Creator Derek Yu calls it \"spiky\", a label that describes many of the things you can impale yourself upon as well as the emotional highs and lows that its teeming, subterranean lunar universe produces in players. A great spectator game, Spelunky 2's streaming and YouTube community is another dimension of experimentation and unbelievable feats.## 47\\. The Jackbox Party Pack 7 **Released** October 15, 2020 | **Last position** New Entry(Image credit: Jackbox Games, Inc) **Robin:** I don't think there exists a better digital icebreaker than a good round of Jackbox. It's brilliantly accessible--anyone who can work a smartphone can join in--and adapts wonderfully to the sense of humour of whatever group you've assembled. Family gatherings, drunken parties, or lunchtime in the office--it does it all. **Morgan:** Party Pack 7 is a particular banger, too. Champ'd up did the impossible task of surpassing the best ever Jackbox game before it: Tee KO. **Mollie:** I stand by Party Pack 4 being the greatest purely for Survive The Internet, but Party Pack 7 has consistently better games. Jackbox is a great way to get the party started or serve as a fun, accessible time when you're not quite ready for the night to end. I can't even begin to count how many in-jokes between me and my pals have been born as a result of Jackbox. **Released** August 8, 2018 | **Last position** 35(Image credit: Capcom) **Rich:** A triumphant reimagining of Capcom's already-excellent series that looks gorgeous and delivers some of the best co-op times you'll ever have. Incredible combat with huge depth, spectacular monsters and environments, and there's so much of it. You never want this game to end, and it feels like it never does. **Wes:** 2020 expansion Iceborne adds an endgame zone you can spend months in and a vastly streamlined gathering hub for multiplayer. It's everything I didn't know I needed in the base game. **Mollie:** Monster Hunter: World has been winding down for a while, with the final content update releasing in October last year and the release of Rise on the Nintendo Switch not too long ago. I'm basically waiting for that to hit PC now, but Monster Hunter: World will still remain an excellent game. It really nailed the balance between the series' traditionally tough gameplay while being super friendly to newcomers. Also, the hunting horn absolutely whips. Doot bro for life. **Released** March 23, 2020 | **Last position** 20(Image credit: Valve) **Chris:** One of the few blockbuster games built from the ground up for VR, and certainly the best and most beautiful. Whatever Valve did under the hood with the game's locomotion, it's easily the most comfortable VR game, one that I could play for hours at a time without feeling the nausea or headaches VR usually gives me after about 40 minutes. Plus, it cleverly rewrote some Half-Life lore that's been in the books for a decade, priming us for whatever comes next. **Dave:** Easily the best VR game ever made. It's also one of the finest Half-Life games too, and damn, is it ever creepy. Stalking through broken down infested zones of City 17 to avoid the zombies, or bursting out into the streets for a firefight with the Combine, Alyx is an absolute must for Half-Life fans. And, oh my god, those liquid physics. I could spend hours just shaking vodka bottles. **Released** February 19, 2019 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Red Candle Games) **Rachel:** First released back in February 2019, Devotion was available on Steam for only six days before it was hit with its infamous review-bombing controversy. Determined to re-release the game, Red Candle put it back up for sale this year, letting players finally experience its superb suburban horror.Sharing many similarities to Konami's claustrophobic house in PT, Devotion is a story about a family living in a small 1980s apartment in Taiwan, each member having their own personal demons dragged out into the house's stark fluorescent lighting. Everything kicks off after the daughter contracts a mysterious illness, which causes the desperate father to tumble into a spiral of paranoia and misplaced spiritualism.What's great about Devotion is that there are no literal monsters, the game is more interested in how the troubled headspaces of a family can seep into the physical space of a home. It's not often we get to see the exploration of a person's religious faith and seeing how Red Candle has used that to create an insidious story of family tragedy is like no other horror game I've played. It's a horror tale that actually cares about its characters, and together with artful sequences and spine-chilling moments, it's truly one of the best horror stories of all time. A game that was well worth the wait. **Released** May 7, 2021 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Capcom) **James:** Resident Evil Village is so much more than the tall vampire woman. I mean, Lady Dimitrescu certainly makes a lasting impression, but she's just one chapter of this excellent cosmic horror anthology. This is Resident Evil doing its best A24 horror impression, moving from a frozen village overrun with lycans, through a classic game of cat and mouse in a lavish castle, and later arriving at color-drained industrial body horror--something like Hellraiser meets Saw. Village goes from goofy action to the scariest setpieces in the series' history, embracing everything I identify with Resident Evil: locked doors, ridiculous keys, and goofy characters. This is Resident Evil at its most self aware, at its scariest, and its most surprising. **Alan:** The latest Resident Evil has some great stand-out moments, with a giddy number of villains and game genres checked off as you explore its chilling environs. The highlight for me was hiding beneath a bed bereft of weapons while an oversized nightmare wailed horribly while searching for our hero. It's got to be one of its most chilling moments it has to offer--I don't think I've completed a level so quickly in my life. **Jacob:** Resident Evil Village isn't afraid to hand you a big gun and lots of ammo. Sure, there are moments that make you want to throw your mouse in the bin and never come back to your PC, but most of the time it's an extremely well-paced and entertaining gore flick. **Released** September 2, 2014 | **Last position** 18(Image credit: EA) **Mollie:** I have a lot of love for The Sims 4. It had a rocky launch and issues that still persist years later, but it's the first game I boot up whenever I get that creative itch. The build mode is genuinely fantastic, and I feel like Maxis is finally getting the hang of making consistently excellent expansion packs. The gameplay is still a little vapid compared to earlier entries, but it's a hell of a lot better than it used to be. The biggest bummer, and the reason for its steep drop this year, is how high the financial barrier to entry has become. The base game is painfully barren, with simple additions like seasons and pets essentially locked behind paywalls. You could buy a lot of games in the Top 100 for the same price as a complete Sims 4 collection, and that makes it harder to recommend. **Rachel:** Big fan of The Sims, but the fact that EA are still making players pay \u00a335/$40 for expansion packs in 2021 where Games Pass and other subscription services are a thing is beyond me. Totally agree with Mollie, that financial barrier is bullshit and it drags down The Sims' placement on our list. **Fraser:** Now I can capture sims and imprison them in a glass cell as a vampire. The Sims 4 has really changed the way I kidnap my neighbours. **Released** September 17, 2020 | **Last position** 79(Image credit: Supergiant Games) **Jorge:** Hades is a gorgeous and stylish hack-and-slash roguelike featuring some of the best writing, voice acting, and music around. As Zagreus, the Prince of the Underworld, you try to escape to the land of the living to meet your mother. Meanwhile, your father, Hades, is doing everything in his power to keep you from her.While the combat for Hades is challenging, fun, and easy to wrap your head around, you'll spend a lot of your time chit-chatting with the denizens of the underworld, building relationships, and learning more about yourself and your dysfunctional (even for Greek gods) family.Hades is a game where you tell yourself, \"Ok, this is the last run, then I'm going to bed,\" and before you know it, you're up at 4 am for the third night in a row and calling in sick from work. **Rachel:** Supergiant had no business making the gods of ancient Greece that hot. **Released** April 24, 2018 | **Last position** 29(Image credit: Paradox Interactive) **Fraser:** One of my favourite tactics games of all time, BattleTech is an exciting romp through a galaxy full of intrigue, ambitious nobles and giant mechs. There's a good campaign tying all the fights together, but brawling with steel monstrosities is what keeps the grin on my face. You can build your mech dream team--axe-wielding behemoths with jetpacks, gargantuan mobile weapon platforms, precious wee scouts--and then fling them into tricky battles where you have to worry about heat, terrain and limbs getting blown off. To the victor goes the scrap. **Nat:** BattleTech understands that the best mech fiction fundamentally treats mechs as terrible things. The story has an air of beautiful tragedy, feudal states clashing and backstabbing each other over a handful of stars in the arse end of the galaxy. It's a tone that bleeds into every mission, making your clutch plays feel all the more desperate, every hard-fought victory all the sweeter. **Released** October 27, 2009 | **Last position** 28(Image credit: Riot Games) **Steven:** Dota players will crucify me for it, but League of Legends is the only MOBA you should play in 2021. It's just so much more accessible, without sacrificing any of the crazy high-level teamplay, and its emphasis on skilful solo play makes for ridiculously exciting moments where a single player can swing the game in their favor. It's also fun being a part of a cinematic universe with Legends of Runeterra and Teamfight Tactics. **Released** August 21, 2012 | **Last position** 38(Image credit: Valve) **Rich:** I still play Counter-Strike on a weekly basis and, even when the likes of Siege or Valorant have tempted me away for a time, I always come back. Where the competition is full of gadgets and powers and classes, CS: GO's absolute purity and dedication to a core that works so well it remains irresistible. And while I've heard some awful stuff on team chat, I've also made a lot of good buddies over the years: when you have a little 'crew' that's on regularly, this game goes to another level. **Evan:** It's the most popular FPS in the world, an almost decade-old giant that stands on the shoulder of arguably the most successful mod of all time (sorry, DOTA). It's one of my most-played games ever. But in 2021, it's aging. Is it really the shooter I'd recommend to someone first right now? No way. Recent experiments like adding a battle royale mode have only revealed the greying tech that CS:GO sits upon. **Nat:** I'm not a CS:GO player. But as a veteran Source mapper, I have endless respect for the way it's kept the torch of community map-making lit all these years. Source may be dated, but Counter-Strike's mappers are doing incredible things with it. **Released** May 17, 2017 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Square Enix) **Mollie:** I don't even know how to put into words what Nier: Automata is and why it's so special, but I wish I could wipe my brain and experience it again for the first time. A flawless soundtrack, satisfying combat and heart-wrenching story permeates every second of this game. It hasn't always run the best on PC, but a brand-new fix makes this the perfect time to dive in. **Steven:** I finally beat Automata for the first time this year and damn, I'm so glad I did. There's just nothing like it. And while I'd love for us to also make room for Nier: Replicant, its prequel, on this list, I'd encourage anyone who loved Automata to go back and play it. It's arguably even more emotionally compromising. **Fraser:** I wish there were more endings so I'd have an excuse to play Nier: Automata all over again. **Wes:** The original Nier had such great characters and quirky diversions (it turns into a text adventure for a bit at one point) that it was worth playing despite some really mundane combat. Automata fixed that problem and feels like it fully explores the ideas Yoko Taro didn't have the time or budget to explore in his previous games. It's a game we'll still be talking about in 20 years.## 36\\. Return of the Obra Dinn **Released** October 18, 2018 | **Last position** 23(Image credit: Lucas Pope) **Rachel:** Although it's fallen a little on our list, Return of the Obra Dinn is still one of the best detective games on PC. Apart from Paradise Killer, another fantastic detective game that you will have passed to get here, no other game makes you work harder for answers and celebrates your victories like Obra Dinn does. The ghostly tale it spins of the disappearance of a single ship and its crew will chill you to the bone. It still gives me the heebie-jeebies. **Phil:** Possibly the most perfectly paced puzzle game around. As you explore, you'll naturally stumble into hints that can recontextualise your thinking and send you down a rabbit hole of new revelations. **Chris:** It does the best possible combination of things. It makes you look around and think \"There is no way in hell I'll ever be able to solve this\" and then a little while later leaves you saying \"I've solved this and I'm a genius.\" Super satisfying. **Rich:** I could honestly argue for this being number one, it's simply stunning. Play it! **Released** January 23, 2020 | **Last position** 13(Image credit: Cardboard Computer) **Rachel:** There have been some amazing story-led games released in the last year, which means that our old friend Kentucky Route Zero has dropped a considerable amount. Its highway adventure is still the most evocative and aetherial story on this list, full of magical-realist tales of rural America and its struggles. I'll never forget listening to a chorus of ghostly voices inside a mineshaft belonging to those who had lost their lives in a rockslide. It's both haunting and beautiful. **Nat:** I didn't follow KRZ along its ten-year journey, instead playing the whole thing with my partner across a few nights last winter. A powerful, sombre, singular thing, and one of the two games to ever leave me in tears at my keyboard. **Released** July 1, 2021 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Mohawk Games) **Fraser:** I've been waiting a long time for a historical 4X game that can give Civilization a run for its money, and here it is. Mohawk Games has taken all the best parts of the venerable series, but focused on antiquity rather than all of human history. Every turn represents a year, which allows Old World to take a more intimate approach, exploring characters instead of just empires.There are plenty of innovations, like an Order system that teaches you to prioritise what actions you want to take that turn, but it's definitely the Crusader Kings-style characters and abundance of narrative events that feel like the most important addition. Leaders age and die, get married, have children, plot against rivals, and you've got a whole court of people to worry about. It's Civ reimagined as a life sim and RPG. **Evan:** As you said, the lineage system adds a layer of passive storytelling that I didn't know I wanted in a 4X. Very interested to see how the next Civ responds to Old World. **Released** December 12, 1999 | **Last position** 11(Image credit: Interplay) **Jody:** There's an argument that the real defining feature of RPGs is the areas between fights where you just talk to people, and Planescape's Sigil--a city on the inner surface of a ring with magic doors that connects it to multiple dimensions--is one of the best. There's a guy who's been on fire so long everyone's used to it and he's become a local bar's mascot, a zombie called The Post whose body is used as a billboard, a hivemind of several thousand psychic rats, and a part-demon thief voiced by Sheena Easton. The combat isn't great, but there's not much of it and way more multidimensional weirdos worth meeting. **Steven:** I'd recommend Planescape as a kind of dessert to anyone who played and loved Disco Elysium. They share so much DNA in their approach to character development and world building, and the agency they give to express yourself not just through dice rolls during combat. I only played Planescape a few years ago, but some of its quests have wormed their way into my head--like a trip to a museum that collects every possible sensation a person could experience. **Released** May 23, 2018 | **Last position**(Image credit: From Software) **Rich:** The only downside to Dark Souls' success is that the game has been so copied and so influential that it's almost a cliche to talk about how good it is. One of the greatest adventures in games, set in a world realised with outstanding imagination, mingled with a deliberately vague and surprising multiplayer element that will still be delighting you on your fifth playthrough. **James:** Dark Souls is challenging, yeah, but like a good coach. Take a breather, kid. Stretch out. Check yourself. Sleep on it. Come back when you're feeling better. Just don't give up. **Released** September 6, 2017 | **Last position** 14(Image credit: Bungie) **Tim:** A mere four years into its life on PC, I did not expect to see Destiny 2 climbing this chart on the back of its storytelling. Once rightly derided for hiding its rich lore in grimoire cards and armour flavour text, over the last year Destiny 2 has quietly reinvented how to create ongoing narrative in a live service game. Using a combination of choreographed NPC conversations and the occasional cutscene, a soapy plot develops from week to week, complete with twists, heel turns, and Saturday morning cartoon cliffhangers. We've seen major characters killed off, big bads come and go (or have they?), and finally had the sense that the guardians are actually part of an evolving universe.Or in other words, Bungie has actually found a model that delivers on the game's original promise all those E3s ago. And it's working: keeps players interested in what's happening rather than just grinding for god roll weapons. It also helps that the mix of matchmade activities, exotic quests and hidden missions has been refined to the point that the variance in quality from season to season is way less wild than it used to be. And if you'd rather not pay at all, there's still an incredibly robust game here to play entirely for free, including endgame content such as the Vault of Glass raid. The only reason Destiny 2 isn't even higher here is that the PVP side of the game has been neglected to the point of abandonment. **Phil:** As a Destiny player, I spend a lot of time complaining about Destiny. But even I will admit that the game is in a good position at the moment. After the disappointing Season of the Hunt, which launched alongside Beyond Light, subsequent seasons have been a triumph--helped along by a handful of showcase activities, from Presage to the returning Vault of Glass. As always, though, the promise of Destiny remains what it could be. Next year, alongside The Witch Queen expansion, we get weapon crafting and a guaranteed schedule for raids and dungeons. It all sounds great, but the devil is in the details, and Destiny does have a habit of moving two steps back for every one forward. **Released** May 30, 2020 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Coffee Stain Publishing) **Robin:** I think this is quietly the most exciting co-op shooter in years. Its use of procedural generation is nothing short of remarkable, churning out fresh, fascinating, and frequently beautiful levels every session. And working together to conquer those levels, using its arsenal of tools to build, dig, and demolish your way to success, is fantastically satisfying. So many co-op games are just about being as efficient and deadly as possible, but Deep Rock feels like some kind of wonderful group project in the way it forces you to combine your creative powers and problem-solve as a team.One of its cleverest mechanics is the way it uses light. The depths you're charged with exploring are dark and dingy, and sometimes completely pitch-black. Managing light--through throwable flares and the scout class' flare gun--is a vital part of your strategy, which feels truly unique. Being the guy who makes sure everyone can see has become my favourite role in the game.And it adds so much drama to exploration, too--it's always a wonderfully tense moment when you fire a light off into the darkness of a cavern. Perhaps as it arcs it'll reveal the tell-tale glitter of gold, or perhaps it'll disturb a nest of skittering bugs. Perhaps it'll illuminate a vastly high ceiling, revealing the cave to be endlessly bigger than you thought it was. Or perhaps it'll just shine on some lovely, weird, fascinating bit of scenery thrown out by the level generator--like a garden of alien fungi, or a strange, icy spire. Those are the moments I treasure most, when something grabs my eye and I find myself just stopping to appreciate the unique, ephemeral landscape we're burrowing through. You don't get that in Left 4 Dead. **Released** June 16, 2021 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Consumer Softproducts) **James:** Cruelty Squad is a monstrous immersive sim, a game held together with duck tape and bad vibes. As a gig economy assassin killing men that pose a threat to a higher order of immortal CEO gods in a hypersaturated mess of jagged polygons and screaming textures, it's difficult to not feel bad. But using my guts to grapple up to a sniper nest above the Cancer Megamall? This is a shit jawbreaker with a dense pleasure chemical core. Cruelty Squad isn't cruel. It's just honest.   **Morgan:** It's an incredible premise with an equally mind-bending art style. Nothing about Cruelty Squad easily slots into other videogames (don't even get me started on how you reload). Even its menus have to be studied like fine art before you can parse which button means \"play.\" That may be more work than some are willing to put in, but if you do, you'll find lots of absurd guns and implants to play with. **Released** February 22, 2018 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Crytek) **Jacob:** You might be wondering why Hunt: Showdown has only now made its way into our Top 100, many years after it first launched. The reason being this PvEvP shooter has only gone from strength to strength in 2021, incorporating steady updates, improvements, and, finally, an immeasurably entertaining new map.Fundamentally, though, Hunt: Showdown is and always has been a wildly tactical shooter that captures a turn of the century shootout like no other. Seriously, you'll be ducking behind boxes and barrels with bullets whizzing over head and lobbing dynamite into shacks in no time. It also rewards good teamwork and strategy, so if you've got a couple friends to play with that's absolutely the best way to experience the game. **Morgan:** There truly is no other FPS like Hunt: Showdown. The idea of basing a competitive shooter around realistic 18th century guns is absurd for so many reasons, but Crytek pulled it off spectacularly. Hunt's arsenal is so unique that I constantly want to switch up my playstyle to try something now. In one match I'll use the first ever pump action shotgun (that loads from the top?) and the next a single-shot, breech-loading rifle from the Civil War. Because Crytek is Crytek, Hunt's attention to detail in map design, sound design, and combat balance is also extremely good. It's a hard FPS to learn, but endlessly fun once you \"get\" it. **Released** July 7, 2015 | **Last position** 46(Image credit: Psyonix) **Rich:** 2,400 hours on Steam probably says it all. I've literally spent 100 days of my life playing this. OK some of that would have just been the game idling but\u2026 wow, guess I better rethink my life choices. A perfect game and has been since launch: once the controls and rhythm get their hooks in, you'll never look back. Put it on my grave: my name was Richard Stanton, and I drove a rocket car. **Tyler:** 1,267 hours here, much in competitive Snow Day, a mode that was originally added as a joke, more or less. I think that if you can replace a ball with a hockey puck in your game and people go, \"Ah, this is actually a way of life now,\" you must have a fundamentally brilliant foundation. **Released** February 26, 2016 | **Last position** 52(Image credit: ConcernedApe) **Mollie:** Stardew Valley has always been a great game, but the recent 1.5 update has turned it into an excellent one. Tons of late-game content and quality-of-life improvements has made owning a farm, marrying a reformed alcoholic and owning a small army of truffle-sniffing pigs better than ever. **Robin:** Co-op is such a great addition to the formula. I've never even been that big of a Stardew fan, but building a farm together with my partner has been a lovely way to pass the time in lockdown. **Rachel:** I just can't get enough of Stardew Valley, especially when someone like ConcernedApe is behind it. Not only do we get massive updates for free but he's always so lovely of the community. Constantly supporting modders, using their own money as prize pools for tournaments, and personally hopping into players' code when they have an issue. What a guy. **Released** February 27, 2018 | **Last position** 19(Image credit: Subset Games) **Rich:** Almost feels like the isometric strategy genre distilled down to its purest drops. A game all about precision planning, the huge amounts of combinations you can wring out of apparently simple abilities, and quickfire playthroughs that always feel different. I don't have much appetite for the grander turn-based strategy games anymore, purely because of time, and this is the perfect replacement. **Evan:** It's surprisingly grim! Reminds me of Evangelion. This definitely isn't the kind of mecha anime where everyone goes out for milkshakes after defeating the great evil. FTL composer Ben Prunty's score weeps for the dimensions left behind by the player as they fail or succeed. Narrativizing the endless loop of roguelikes is one of ITB's fine touches. **Phil:** Into the Breach gets a lot of mileage from an 8x8 grid. By showing you what your enemies are about to do each turn--and, more specifically, what they're about to destroy--you're challenged to unwork their plans, hopefully coming out the other end without too many losses. **Released** June 13, 2020 | **Last position** 24(Image credit: Atlus) **Robin:** There's so much brilliant weirdness in this game, but really the thing it does best is the real world stuff. It invokes such an authentic, specific sense of place with its slice of Japanese country life, simultaneously idyllic and isolating. Even its bizarre mysteries are really just a stand-in for all the things that seem so life-or-death when you're a teenager, the things that grown-ups will never understand. **Mollie:** No JRPG has ever quite matched the energy Persona 4 Golden brings, and no game has ever led me to be so deeply attached to a ragtag group of teenagers and their terrifying bear mascot. **Morgan:** Yea, Persona 5 has the style, but P4 has the heart. I haven't played the game in nine years and I still can't get that damn Junes song out of my head. **Mollie:** Every day's great at your Junes! Dammit, Morgan. **Phil:** Filled with intriguing mystery; offering questions like \"What do these bizarre murders say about our society?\" and \"How do we reconcile with the worst parts of our nature?\" and \"Why is there a talking bear suit?\" **Released** September 28, 2017 | **Last position** Re-entry(Image credit: SEGA) **Jody:** Unlike other Total War games, the things I remember from Warhammer happened on the battlefield. As mad-science ratmen I've killed an elf queen then dragged her corpse away under arrow-fire to experiment on it, and as vampire pirates I've summoned a ghost ship to drop on the proud warriors of Ulthuan. I did that as an undead opera singer named Cylostra Direfin, who pronounces her surname with a flourish, \"dear-fah\", like a Warhammer version of Hyacinth Bucket.The fantasy setting makes Total War ridiculous, extravagant, extra. It's great not just because I remember highlights from multiple campaigns, but because the gonzo factions make multiple campaigns worth playing. The expansions and the way each game can be connected builds on that, meaning the best Total War keeps getting better. **Fraser:** I'm still convinced that Three Kingdoms is the stronger strategy game, but there's no denying the seductive qualities of Warhammer. Dragons and orcs are, admittedly, a bit more exciting than loads and loads of regular soldiers. Maybe this sounds like damning the game with faint praise, but Warhammer 2 really is amazing. There isn't another with such great and experimental factions, and Creative Assembly has really worked some magic with its DLC additions, which are often accompanied by free game-changing tweaks. The gap between 2 and 3 has been a lot more substantial than the previous gap, but we've absolutely benefited from this, as the game has kept growing in the interim. **Robin:** This is the game that makes me wish I clicked with Total War. I can't get down with the strategy battles at all, but I absolutely adore the passion for the setting that leaks out of every pore of the game's being. From units ripped from the pages of old White Dwarf magazines I remember reading as a teenager to lovely little in-jokes for fans hidden in tooltips, it's a nostalgic joy for anyone who loves the Old World.## 22\\. Halo: The Master Chief Collection **Released** December 3, 2019 | **Last position** 41(Image credit: Microsoft) **Nat:** Every weekend, for the past year, I've been jumping on for a bout of Halo 3 multiplayer like it was 2007 all over again. There's never been a shooter quite like Halo, and after more than a decade away, Halo's uniquely chaotic sandbox arenas still feels fresh as ever--whether that's a tense slayer match on Blackout, or one of many absurd Forge maps folks are playing on the collection's new server browser.With the Master Chief Collection now on PC in its entirety, 343's collection has proven itself more than just a fun throwback. It's a love letter to FPS fans--letting you dive into more than a decade of Halo history within a single matchmaking playlist, or revisit Bungie's truly stellar campaigns in both original and remastered forms. I may not be a fan of 343's own additions, but you can't deny the studio's done a hell of a job bringing Master Chief back to PC. **Wes:** I want to thank whoever at 343 brought back Halo 3's Rocket Race playlist, a mode I sunk hours into more than a decade ago and still love with all my heart. Beyond nostalgia, though, there's good reason to be excited about the Master Chief Collection's future. A custom game browser is still in development, and once it's live, I expect classic Halo CTF to outlast the heat death of the universe. **Rich:** Can't believe this got ranked above Counter-Strike. Is it still too late to protest? Seriously though: who doesn't love a bit of the Chief, and with MCC some of Bungie's finest work is being kept alive in the way it should be. **Released** December 1, 2015 | **Last position** 25(Image credit: Ubisoft) **Evan:** Folks, this is how you operate a multiplayer game. Siege gets four major updates a year like clockwork, adding new operators that often scramble the meta. But as it's expanded to 60 characters (I still main Thatcher, the EMP Pokeball champ), Siege has simultaneously gone backward to outright rethink some of the game's biggest systems. Older maps get reworked and full-on redesigned. New anti-toxicity measures, pinging, new secondary gadgets, attachments, and entirely overhauled operators have been implemented post-launch. A testament to good production practices, careful roadmapping, and the insane effort it takes to maintain a popular game. **Tyler:** Lately, I've been enjoying opportunities to blow holes in soft walls in Favela, a map that jumped into my favorites list after it was reworked. One of the recently added operators has a bionic arm, too, so I can punch holes in walls if I want. What a gift. After all these years, I'm a little surprised that I'm not being made to think about walls, and how they might be improved with holes, in more games. **Mollie:** I'll level with you right now, I absolutely suck ass at Siege. I've never quite grappled with its learning curve, and my map and operator knowledge are practically non-existent. But when my poor friends put up with my shoddy skills, I have an unbelievable amount of fun. No other shooter feels quite so satisfying. I imagine it's even better when you actually know what you're doing. **Released** November 10, 2020 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: SEGA) **Phil:** Yakuza: Like a Dragon marks the series' transition from arcade brawler to JRPG, and swaps out the stoic long-time lead Kiryu for an entirely new ex-Yakuza--an endearing goofball who can't help but wear his heart on his sleeve. It's still everything you expect from a Yakuza game: a lengthy main story that's filled with twists and turns, numerous sidequests that range from wacky to absolutely absurd, and a whole host of minigames that offer fun diversions to pursue as you explore the city.Its new JRPG combat isn't just a gimmick, either. Not only is it fully woven into the story--and the personality of Ichiban and his growing party of loveable misfits--it also makes for a genuinely deep buildcrafting, with jobs, skills and hilarious summons. **Morgan:** I haven't finished Like a Dragon, but Ichiban is already one of my favorite game protagonists ever. **Released** May 19, 2020 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Origame Digital) **Nat:** Umurangi Generation is loud, raw, angry. An anti-colonial protest wrapped in Jet Set Radio and Evangelion, handing you a wonderfully tactile camera with which to capture the end of the world. Seriously--I want to take this battered old handheld into every game I've played since, a photo mode built directly into the player's arsenal.Umurangi doesn't sport Hitman 3's complex AI routines, but every level feels gritty and lived-in. Every candid snap of a stranger tells a story of some deadbeat dad, VR-addled waster or bloodied mech pilot trying to make their way through this deeply relatable apocalypse.See, Umurangi might take place in a world full of giant robots and squid-like Kaiju, but its tensions are our tensions. Developed by Mauri artist Veselekov, Umurangi is scathing of the global response to the Australian wildfires (Umurangi meaning \"Red Sky\" in Ves' native tongue). An occupying force pulls your neighbours and friends up to fight their Kaiju war, and oppresses people with curfews and giant concrete walls. By the time you hit Macro, you're exploring maps pulled straight out of 2020's headlines.Where other games fret over whether they're seen as \"political\", Umurangi embraces it--and is all the better for it. **Jody:** The Macro DLC really completes Umurangi Generation, with bigger levels to photograph and rollerblades to get you around them. And while the base game eases you into its dystopia, Macro knows you're on board with its politics from the start and goes hell for leather from the get-go. **Released** March 20, 2020 | **Last position** 14(Image credit: Bethesda) **James:** Doom Eternal was already the most intense shooter ever made, but The Ancient Gods expansions complicate the swirling demon chessboard even further. There's a demon you exorcise from other demons with the microwave beam. A huge hammer for turning a school of imps into paste. You kill a couple gods, no biggie. Your mouse hand's gonna be soaked. **Released** August 24, 2013 | **Last position** 21(Image credit: Square Enix) **Steven:** FF14 takes so much of what is good about WoW and couples it with an emotionally-charged story, gorgeous visuals, and some of the best goddamn music ever scored for a game. There are so many MMOs, but Final Fantasy 14 is the one you should be playing. **Nat:** There's no better game for roleplaying as a gay cat. **Mollie:** Did you know that the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy 14 has a free trial, and includes the entirety of A Realm Reborn and the award-winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 with no restrictions on playtime?But no, for real, Final Fantasy 14 absolutely rules. I've been on-and-off with the game since 2014 and I can safely say there's no better time to get into it than right now. The story, the music, the fashion! There's a little something for everyone. The community is also fantastic, and makes those quieter moments between defeating giant dragons or literal gods so heart-warming. Nowhere else will you run into an impromptu concert of four dragon girls performing A Cruel Angel's Thesis. **Released** February 24, 2017 | **Last position** 8(Image credit: Team Cherry) **Robin:** I replayed this slick, atmospheric metroidvania only recently, and found myself utterly wowed all over again. Despite its tiny team, it's grandly ambitious, in its own way managing to evoke some of the mystery, horror, and grandeur of the Dark Souls series. Like its diminutive bug protagonist, it at first seems unassuming, but reveals greater and greater multitudes as you explore, its world unpeeling layers like a big, dark\u2026 onion. **James:** I'll say it again: Hollow Knight is the best Metroid game. **Released** May 28, 2019 | **Last position** 9(Image credit: Annapurna Interactive) **Phil:** A remarkable exploration game in which you've got just 22 minutes to explore a small, handcrafted solar system full of questions. At the end of your time, the sun blows up and you time-loop back to the start, with nothing except the information you've gleaned along the way. The way the solar system changes over the course of the loop encourages you to keep hold of certain discoveries in order to investigate more thoroughly on the next go around, making for a compelling mystery box that's a joy to unpick. **Fraser:** Time loop narratives often hide a bit of horror behind the whimsy and sci-fi shenanigans, and Outer Wilds is no different. You've got an adorable spaceship, quirky NPCs, and the promise of a great big adventure, but then there's also the whole the-sun-is-about-to-be-destroyed problem. So you might be having a lovely time exploring this enigmatic star system, but the apocalypse is always waiting for you. The dangers of space are not limited to the end of the loop, however, and Outer Wilds proves to be just as capable of more overt horror.You'll be making impossible leaps inside a hollowed-out planet and then fall into a black hole that drops you into the vacuum of space--just you and the void. Not for long, though, because you'll soon be dead. And then you start over again. Maybe on your next run you'll charge into the eye of a tornado. Or spend most of your time hiding from gargantuan, spaceship-eating fish. It throws wonder after wonder at you, but what's stuck with me the most are my many, many deaths. And I'd happily die a dozen more times, because Outer Wilds is brilliant.   **Released** May 28, 2019 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Worldwalker Games LLC) **Rachel:** Wildermyth has been one of this year's biggest surprises, and there was no doubt within the PCG team it would be placed somewhere in the top 15. It's a fantasy adventure that manages to combine procedural stories spun from character-driven traits with procedurally generated events, the end result being a game with enough anecdotes you could write a book.Decisions you make can dramatically affect the story, like if the rogue falls in love with the archer, if the warrior will ever fulfill her lifelong dream, whether characters die on the battlefield or retreat, losing a limb in the process. Your heroes become bruised and scarred as the campaign progresses, reminders of mistakes you've made on the battlefield.Characters can have children who can then join the party, and you can even bring old retired characters back for a new campaign. In this way, Wildermyth feels like you're weaving a mythological tapestry of heroes and their stories, not just ticking off a campaign checklist. Depending on what difficulty you choose, the game will adjust its story for the tone, choosing a tougher, crueler campaign will be complemented with a darker story--it's pretty incredible how the game can adapt like that. It's as close as you can get to the feel of a homebrew tabletop RPG and that's pretty special. **Fraser:** The stories I could tell you. There was the bookish nerd who became an elemental guardian, met a witch who cursed/blessed him with 'crow powers', and then paid a weird dude for a fox tail that he now never takes off. Maybe I should tell you about the two adventurers, one perpetually engulfed in flames, the other slowly transforming into a tree, who fell in love despite their massive differences. Then there was the young woman cursed by a sickness, who discovered a cure and instead used it to save another man's life, inspiring him to pledge it to helping her adventuring party.The stories I could tell you about families, friendships, tragic deaths and heroic interventions. But instead I'll just tell you to play Wildermyth and make your own. **Released** February 24, 2017 | **Last position** 7(Image credit: Bethesda) **Phil:** Aside from being the best stealth game of the 2010s, what makes Dishonored 2 remarkable is that, however you decide to approach its levels, it always has a response. When I kill my target in the opening mission, I later hear his goons announce that he's dead. On a second attempt, I kill him and hide his body in an area the guards can't access--something the game never asks me to do. And yet it apparently knew I might try, because this time the goons announce that he's missing instead. It's a small example, but later on this same attention to detail--this anticipation and extrapolation of the player's agency--applies to some really big, dramatic moments.I could praise the effortless traversal, exciting combat and flexible toolbox of Dishonored 2's action--those things all elevate it above its predecessor. But it's Arkane's extreme dedication to the craft of immersion that make Dishonored 2 the studio's best work. **Morgan:** It's no Prey, but Dishonored 2 is still a tremendously fun stealth game that's basically Arkane showing off with level design for 9+ hours. **Fraser:** Prey wishes it was as refined as Dishonored 2. Sorry Morgan. Arkane never misses, but this one is still the studio's greatest. Everyone talks about exploring a mechanical mansion or using time travel to solve puzzles, and they are incredible missions, but these high points are accompanied by less flashy jobs that are nonetheless products of flawless level design. Every location feels like a work of art and science, with Dishonored's striking aesthetic and tiny details elevating the brilliant mechanics and best-in-class stealth. And if stealth isn't your bag, it's just as compelling when you step out of the shadows and sow chaos with all of your fantastical powers. **Released** February 4, 2016 | **Last position** 12(Image credit: 2K) **Robin:** We've written about Firaxis' modern strategy classic more times than I've lost soldiers, but there's a good reason for that. It's still the absolute gold standard of turn-based strategy on PC, a sprawling tactical puzzle that pokes at your grey matter, but crucially also tugs at your heartstrings, as you love and lose your best squad members. Add in the brilliantly expansive War of the Chosen DLC, full of weird and wonderful villains and technology, and you've a near endlessly replayable package. And a thriving mod scene continues to give it even more life--including the ever popular Long War, which turns the campaign into an even more brutal feat of endurance while cranking up the simulationist detail.Surely we're past time for an XCOM 3 now? Come on Firaxis, get a move on--Chimera Squad was barely a snack to keep us going. **Evan:** Looks like we'll have to settle for Midnight Suns for now, Robin, the upcoming Marvel game from Firaxis that seems a little different mechanically, but is sticking with XCOM's art direction, among other aspects. **Released** September 14, 2017 | **Last position** 2(Image credit: Larian Studios) **Wes:** The best traditional computer RPG of the last decade, Divinity: Original Sin 2 earned developer Larian the opportunity to work on Baldur's Gate 3, which should be out in full in 2022. Original Sin 2 remarkably manages to succeed on every axis as an RPG. Its main quest is exciting and intricate, each of its premade heroes have unique stories worth experiencing, the world is crammed full of sidequests, and you can approach most problems however you want, including killing every NPC in the world like a complete psycho. Hell, if you played it in 2017, play it again: Larian spent a couple years polishing and improving the game, particularly its rushed third act. It's even better now. **Fraser:** The writing, systems and eccentric characters all make Original Sin 2 an all-time great RPG, but mostly what you'll be doing is fighting. Thank goodness, then, that the brawls are all amazing. You can fill the area with fire or poison, sprout wings to fly over obstacles, and try to come up with all sorts of combos and synergies to help you take out the opposition as skillfully (or messily) as possible. Every confrontation is a new laboratory waiting for you to destroy with your experiments. **Jacob:** I must've put a 150 hours into Divinity: Original Sin 2 and I still get the urge to go back and do it all again. If that doesn't speak volumes for this epic RPG\u2026 **Tyler:** I'm disappointed that the mod scene never really took off. The tools Larian released are powerful, but I found them confusing (even for game engine tools) and they crashed often, so I eventually gave up on making a little RPG campaign of my own. It's too bad, because Original Sin 2 seemed like a great foundation for modders. I'll just have to settle for being happy with all the other parts of the game. **Released** February 2, 2021 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Iron Gate Studio) **Chris:** There are no quests in Valheim, no characters, no main storyline. But every journey I take, whether it's to fight a boss or reach a new continent or just to gather berries, feels like a bigger and bolder adventure than most AAA RPGs. The open world is fascinatingly beautiful despite throwback visuals and the danger of the wilderness is offset by the cozy and comforting feel of coming home to my cheerly little wooden fort. Valheim cleverly plays with survival systems, too--food and cooking remain absolutely vital to survival, but you'll never starve to death so gathering never feels like a joyless grind. And for an Early Access game, it never feels like anything is missing, just that more could be added. **Morgan:** I bought Valheim, but ended up renting a Minecraft server and playing that with friends instead. **Jacob:** You really missed out, Morgan. Valheim may sound like your standard survival flick, but it uses remarkably simple systems to create a world you want to keep exploring, and one that's best experienced with a bunch of mates. **Released** May 18, 2015 | **Last position** 4(Image credit: CD Projekt) **Andy K:** While I love the overarching story in The Witcher 3 and its DLC, it's the slower, quieter moments inbetween where the game really sings for me. When it's just me and my horse on the open road, riding between villages, exploring ruins, picking up random quests, and getting tangled up in peoples' lives, I'm never happier. It's like a wandering samurai simulator. And the fact that a simple job pinned to a noticeboard can spiral into a wild, unpredictable, hours-long quest makes exploring this vividly realised world rewarding like no other RPG. This is a rare game where almost every sidequest, including the really small ones, is meaningful or interesting in some way. **Rich:** Rubbish combat, dunno why people like this. **Andy K:** Because there's more to life than fighting, Rich. **Fraser:** And the combat is, at its worst, still OK. That's not what I became a Witcher for, anyway. The best parts aren't the fights; the best parts are the bits before the fights, where you're investigating oddities and meeting new people (and being rude to them) between pub crawls.Even more important than all of that, though, is Geralt himself. What a guy. A stoic, taciturn bloke is hardly a groundbreaking protagonist, but Geralt is so much more than that. He's a man full of subtle complexities, trying to figure out how to be an adoptive father, a hero for people who hate and fear him, and a slayer of monsters in a world where the monsters are often the good guys. What's so impressive is that you can take him in some very different directions and leave the world in a very different place depending on your decisions, but through all that, Geralt is still Geralt. You'll get a strong sense of who he is, and every version feels consistent and canon.   **Lauren:** What my colleagues mean to say is: Geralt is very sexy and could batter your dad. **Released** May 17, 2009 | **Last position** 48(Image credit: Mojang) **Rachel:** I am happy to see Minecraft get the epic list bump it deserves. With the Caves and Cliffs update this year, plus Mojang's work with RTX, and the number of charities and projects using it as a gaming force for good, it deserves a top 10 spot for sure. **Mollie:** I punched my first block of dirt nearly 10 years ago, and I've been in love with Minecraft ever since. Even if I'm not always playing it, it's usually the game I return to when I'm going through a bit of a rough patch with the hobby. Minecraft's versatility really lends itself to the game's longevity--even after a decade, no two playthroughs have been the same for me, and I love that. **Rich:** I don't really play Minecraft anymore but it's one of those games that's still just endlessly fascinating to hear about. The game's community remains so vibrant and it seems like every week there are amazing new things to see, and developer Mojang continues to judiciously add to it without ever detracting from that core appeal of player expression. **Released** 23 July, 2019 | **Last position** 5(Image credit: Mega Crit) **Robin:** The sheer number of imitators that have released on Steam in recent years is testament to the lasting brilliance of Slay the Spire. While many have been a great time in their own right, still none have toppled the king. It's still the absolute tightest, smartest, and most fun to break roguelike deck-building money can buy. **Evan:** When you pull off some clever combo (say, using the Mummified Hand relic and a series of Power cards to reduce the cost of everything in your hand to 0), the sensation of cascading effects is as potent as pulling the trigger on some viral TikTok Rube Goldberg machine. Slay the Spire puts game-breaking power within players' reach, but in turn, drops exponentially more tough bosses and mini-bosses in your way. Few games match its purity of design. **Released** July 14, 2020 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Kojima Productions) **James:** Death Stranding feels like some old-timey Metal Gear Solid 2 nonsense at the start, but rapidly evolves into an open world hiking simulation about building an infrastructure co-op with strangers. I've given dozens of hours over to the cause, hauling truckfuls of materials to maintain our highways, dozens more to crawling up treacherous mountain peaks through blinding blizzards to create an efficient zipline network. All of it, shared with other people in their own game worlds for no tangible videogame reward other than knowing I wasn't the only one to benefit from the hard work. In a capitalist hellworld, it gave me hope, or at least a potent homebrewed chemical signal for coping. **Wes:** *Smashes Like button 137 times* **Rich:** There's simply nothing like Death Stranding, particularly in the context of the pandemic and how eerily its concept maps onto that, and for all Kojima's excesses and some frankly honking cutscenes the experience of traversing this world is unforgettable. Its multiplayer element is so light-touch it's almost not there but, as James says, becomes a focus and a point of pride. You genuinely feel part of something bigger. I can't get this wonderful game out of my head, parts of it will stick with you like nothing else. **Fraser:** It says a lot that a game with obnoxious Monster Energy product placement and a literal advert for a Norman Reedus TV show in the shower is still a great time and full of artistry and thoughtful game design. **Jody:** *Smashes Like button 138 times* **Released** December 5, 2019 | **Last position** 3(Image credit: Future)**Andy K:** No videogame world has beguiled me quite as powerfully as Red Dead's vast, atmospheric slice of the American West. Rockstar's Western epic is a game I frequently revisit just to do nothing in particular: riding aimlessly around the wilderness on my horse, stopping to hunt, chat to fellow travelers, or poke around in old cabins. It's a game I like living in too. Moseying into Valentine to knock back a whisky at the saloon, grabbing a bath or a haircut, trying on some new clothes in the general store, then turning in for the night at the hotel. It's the best cowboy simulator ever made. I love the story (I've finished it twice), but just hanging out in that world is enough to keep me entertained. **Phil:** I've seen a lot of criticism about just how slow Red Dead Redemption 2 is to play--not just in the languid meandering of its story, but in the very essence of how you control Arthur and interact with the world. Personally, though, that uncompromising vision is exactly why I love it so much. You will not save this world from the inexorable march of progress, but at least you can meander around a vast and absurdly atmospheric landscape as you slowly slip into irrelevance. Big mood, as the kids say. **Fraser:** I played RDR2 on PS4, so when it came to PC I skipped the story--it's brilliant, but not play-for-another-120-hours-brilliant--and headed straight to Red Dead Online. And I've kept returning. This is impressive, since Red Dead Online is not very good. I don't enjoy any of the activities, and the grind for gold, season passes and all the other live service nonsense just makes Red Dead worse. So why do I keep coming back? Because it's bloody gorgeous. Riding up to the crest of a hill, you're treated to some of the best views in gaming--endless skies and plains and mountains that look better than real. And then there's the weather, the critters, the way mud and blood clings to you, every single animation--it's all amazing.  **Released** February 4, 2019 | **Last position** 17(Image credit: Respawn) **Nat:** Apex Legends has always been good. Of the big battle royales, it's the best one if you just want to pick a good fight. The guns feel great, the characters are all memorable dirtbags with fun abilities, and Respawn figured out just the right amount of Titanfall 2's movement to carry over into a sprawling battle royale. But last year saw Apex truly come into its own as a confident successor to Respawn's wallrunner.Olympus is far and away the game's best (and prettiest) map to date, though a newly-refurbished World's Edge comes close. Arenas are a welcome alternative to battle royale that feels like a more accessible, Apex-flavoured spin on Valorant. And the game's cast has only gotten better and better with Titanfall throwbacks, Aussie firecrackers, and the long-overdue addition of Scottish people to the Apex roster. Shoutout to Respawn for straight-up adding me to the game, eh?All of that on top of rounds that always feel like they have the pitch-perfect mix of downtime looting and high-octane firefights. In 2021, Apex Legends isn't just a good battle royale. It's probably the best competitive shooter you can play today. **Phil:** I took a break from Apex after Respawn _ruined_ World's Edge by removing the train (and the Mirage party boat). I've finally been dragged back in, and I've fallen back in love all over again. My favourite change this season is that all the maps are now available on rotation. That gives a genuine sense of variety over the course of an evening, especially given that the most recent World's Edge rework leaves it in a much better place. Sure, most games are still swallowed up by Fragment, but at least you know you're only ever a couple of hours away from a return to Olympus. **Released** September 1, 2020 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: Paradox Interactive) **Fraser:** Crusader Kings 3 is simply the best strategy game around. And it would probably be the best RPG if it wasn't for Disco Elysium. Everything that made its predecessor so great for nearly a decade is here, but better integrated, more refined, and improved by a whole bunch of new systems that make this sequel feel like more than a repeat.It's huge and dense, but even after just a few hours with the game you'll walk away with enough stories to fill a book--like the time you walked into your bedroom and found a courtier having sex with your shoe, or when you \"accidentally\" lost a child in the woods when you realised they were about to cause a succession crisis. Thanks bears! More strategy games are thinking about story and narrative, but Crusader Kings still sits on the throne. **Chris:** There's really nothing else like it (except for Crusader Kings 2). It's a grand strategy in a massive world constantly rocked by major events, but my focus is continually drawn back to the tiniest personal dramas like why a court member's entire family approves of me except for one small child who hates my guts. Why does this kid dislike me so much? What did I ever do to them? Yes, I know there's a war raging outside and my Spymaster is plotting against me and I'm running out of gold, but that can all wait. I need to solve this vexing mystery first!Like Fraser said, it's a guaranteed story generator. There's always something interesting, bizarre, hilarious, or tragic happening somewhere in your character's life, whether you succeed or fail or even if you don't even quite know how to play it yet. **Jacob:** Every so often I boot up Crusader Kings just to kill an hour or two when I'm on my laptop. Well, one thing leads to another and I end up wasting a day glued to my screen. Usually I'm plotting some grand scheme involving mass intrigue and espionage, but by the time I'm done playing I've lost three heirs to disease and been labelled an adulterer by my entire kingdom. Great game. **Lauren A:** I'm still not over the stabbing-my-cousin-in-the-face incident during a feast I held as King Malcolm because he insulted me. Standard night out in Central Scotland, really. **Released** January 20, 2021 | **Last position** New entry(Image credit: IO Interactive) **Fraser:** Now that IO Interactive has completed its ambitious world of assassination, you can play Hitman 1-3 in a single package, giving you a lifetime of elaborate murders to pull off. It feels like an endless vacation where you occasionally top someone. A trip to a gaudy Dubai skyscraper one day, and then it's off to an Argentinian winery the next, and each of them is bursting with potential for mischief. Hitman 3 is an exceptional game in its own right--not least because it contains a spot-on Agatha Christie mystery where you get to play the detective--but the real selling point is getting to play the entire trilogy with all of the enhancements. It's a great excuse to revisit Sapienza for the hundredth time. **Phil:** Hitman 3 alone probably wouldn't be as high on this list. But Hitman 3 as a way to access the entire trilogy--including the ever-expanding selection of escalation contracts and time-limited elusive targets--is essential. Each game has its own personality. The first is IO rediscovering their aptitude for creating intricate stealth sandboxes, and getting bolder and more experimental as they go. Hitman 2 ups the scale, with some of the largest levels in the series' history, each packed full of things to try. Hitman 3 is tighter and more focused, but builds on the previous games for a confident finale full of memorable scenarios. Each mission is ridiculously replayable, and this package brings together more than 20 of them. You could play this for years and never run out of new things to try. **James:** If aliens invaded earth and demanded a single cultural artifact that represents what we humans call videogames, I would give them Hitman 3. It has everything: espionage, geopolitical intrigue, and slapstick comedy. Everything in the World of Assassination trilogy represents the best of game design too, working as a simultaneous sandbox and teacher. I've played the same levels dozens of times, reverse engineering guard patrols, NPC AI behaviors, and how my weapons and tools interact with it all (by throwing them all at the heads of innocent bystanders).While the first run through a Hitman level is typically overwhelming, the options endless and threats leading to more improvisational playthroughs, my 20th go at The Dartmoor Manor with nothing but a shotgun went off without a hitch. You'd think I'd enabled cheats, the way I slipped through sightlines and manipulated the field with my shiny coins to point-blank five guards in an escalation without getting spotted. There's a reason Agent 47 is an emotionally stunted bald man: because we need someone to look up to. **Andy K:** Having Hitman 1-3 in one package is a real treat. This is some of the best stealth in the history of videogames, with levels that are big, complex, and pulsing with life and detail. It's Hitman 3's Berlin that really steals the show for me. A crowded warehouse rave where the tables are turned and hitmen come after you. This is a neat switcheroo, and trying to kill these guys with eyes everywhere is a challenge like no other in the series.## 1\\. Disco Elysium - The Final Cut **Released** October 15, 2019 | **Last position** 1(Image credit: Studio ZA/UM) **Evan:** A richly detailed roleplaying game about a deeply human shared experience: losing your wallet. **Encyclopedia:** The creation of an Estonian studio who'd never made a videogame before, Disco Elysium is a revolutionary detective RPG set in the imaginary city of Revachol, and in particular its impoverished dockside district of Martinaise, whose politics serve as a mirror of our own. **Drama:** Good sire, you neglect what's most important. Disco Elysium gives your skills a voice, and the more points you put in them the more likely they are to interject with their own observations, whether helpful (like when I point out a character who may be lying to you), or unhelpful (like whatever nonsense Electro-Chemistry is about to inflict upon us). **Electro-Chemistry:** You both forgot what really matters. Disco Elysium open-palm slams you right into the poetic streaming consciousness of a shambling maniac who broke his brain with a whole lot of drugs. Yummy, yummy drugs. **Wes:** It's a marvel that Disco Elysium manages to make the warring voices of your brain funnier, more compelling companions than typical RPG followers. The way your skill points affect how active they are in conversations and how their dialogue helps you understand your character and the world around you--it's just brilliant. I can't think of another RPG that makes bad dice rolls so fun, either. I never felt the urge to savescum in Disco Elysium because there was always a clever bit of dialogue waiting for me, even when I literally fell on my ass. **Evan:** Exactly, Wes: the way that those different brain voices passively interject based on how much you've developed them--and the fact that they can still betray you and offer bad advice!--is genius and reflective of what it feels like to be human. A person with \"Level 10 Empathy\" can still make a bad decision by listening to that empathy at the wrong moment. In this, I love how much Disco cares about what I don't say. A numbered list of dialogue options shouldn't be a series of cabinets you rummage through to get the stuff inside. What you say affects the world and reflects who you are. **Fraser:** Disco Elysium was close to the perfect RPG when it first launched, but miraculously ZA/UM has managed to make it even better. In a huge free update, the studio added full voice acting, something I didn't feel that was missing until I heard it. Even your internal monologue gets the treatment, with a superb performance from Lenval Brown giving your skills and inner thoughts even more personality. As a bonus, there are a bunch of political vision quests, too, which serve to create a climax for your journey of self-discovery. As challenging as some of the subject matter is, it's an unmissable game. **Andy K:** Still unbeatable. Every RPG I've played since, I've thought to myself: \"I wish this was more like Disco Elysium.\" The sheer variety of ways to shape your character--and how people in the world react so specifically to what you've moulded this grotesque lump of cop-shaped clay into--makes it a role-playing experience like no other. I can't remember the last time I was so completely consumed by a game's setting and atmosphere either. I'm listening to the music from the Whirling-in-Rags (the extra dreamy 12pm version) as I type this, and I want to be back there, interrogating burly dockworkers, singing heartbreaking karaoke, and slowly piecing together what I did on my apocalyptic bender a few nights before. Disco Elysium is a truly singular game. There's never been anything like it, and there probably won't be ever again, even if ZA/UM makes a sequel. **Robin:** I'm always moaning that RPGs don't draw enough inspiration from the creativity and innovation of the modern tabletop RPG scene. PC gaming still feels very stuck in nostalgia for the tabletop games of the 80s and 90s to me - D&D, World of Darkness, Cyberpunk - while ignoring so many clever new approaches to the genre.Disco Elysium is the first big exception. It doesn't draw from any one specific tabletop game, but it's absolutely pickled in the ideas and attitude of the modern scene. With its wonderfully abstract stats and abilities, its focus on its hero's internal life as much as his external, and its sharply political outlook, it's a million miles away from dungeon crawling or vampire brooding - and easy bedfellows with tabletop indie darlings like Apocalypse World, Blades in the Dark, or Spire.I think that's such a welcome step forward for the genre.There are a huge number of fantastic games that didn't make it into our top 100, so here are some of the PC Gamer team's personal favourites.(Image credit: Warner Bros.)Holy deadline Batman! He chose a six year-old game with an infamously bad PC launch! Yes I did, because earlier this year I played this: and wow have the years been kind. This game still looks stunning, plays amazingly well, and is simply packed with Bat-stuff to find. The most fun I've had with a singleplayer game this year, and the best superhero game ever made.(Image credit: Dreamfeel)If Found\u2026remains to be one of the best visual novels on PC. Its story of a young queer woman is both painfully beautiful and simultaneously gut-wrenching and the way you wipe away each panel revealing the next fits perfectly in a story about erasing the past to make room for a new beginning.(Image credit: D-Cell Games)Calling it now: arcade rhythm adventure Unbeatable is going to be the coolest game of whatever year it launches in. The White Label demo is a strong opener for the game's setlist of high-paced beats--framed by snapshots of a world oozing with sun-bleached, anime-tinted melancholy.(Image credit: Square Enix)I know, I wasn't keen on it at first either. But I stuck with it and it's become one of the FF games I'll replay every couple of years. The story is great, Lightning is badass, and while the combat isn't my favourite--hello FF12--it's still fun to play around with.(Image credit: Atlus)Yes, it's weird that this is on PC before Persona 5. But Strikers is fantastic, and the only Warriors-style game I've ever managed to stomach. It manages to retain most of Persona 5's original charm and jazzy style, feeling like a fun summer reunion with your old school pals.## Evan Lahti: Rising Storm 2: Vietnam(Image credit: Tripwire Interactive)A tremendously underrated FPS that draws on obscure skills: your vision, your knack for marking the perfect artillery spot with binoculars, your willingness to die to apply pressure to the objective. The asymmetries between the Vietnamese factions (both North and South) and US forces create memorably scrappy firefights. A messier and better Battlefield.## James Davenport: The Evil Within 2(Image credit: Bethesda)The Evil Within 2 takes horror into huge open spaces and still pulls off a ton of memorable scares. That shed in the distance might just be a fixture in your playthrough, but in mine? She harassed me the rest of the game, hair to the floor with that horrible shriek.(Image credit: Rockstar)An anthology of compelling, cleverly constructed detective mysteries, set in a lavish, painstakingly researched recreation of 1940s Los Angeles. The impressive face capture tech, along with a cast of genuinely great actors (including several familiar faces from Mad Men), gives L.A. Noire a prestige TV feel, and it's a world I love losing myself in.(Image credit: Asymmetric)Truly funny games are rare, and in WoL everything from the dialogue to the item descriptions are brilliantly witty, so much so you'll spend extra time playing just to make sure you've found every last bit of text. And despite the stick figure art, it's a true, open world Western! Yeehaw!(Image credit: Velan Studios)If you told me months ago that EA would put out a competitive dodgeball game that'd consume my life for a month, I'd laugh. Still, Knockout City really is that good. Its unique combat system looks like a kid-friendly shooter at first, but it's all about timing, fakeouts, and coordination.## Jody MacGregor: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade(Image credit: SEGA)Still my favorite RTS thanks to a paint-the-map campaign where structures remain in the territories where you left them. Hours later you return to contested ground to find your defences still standing, ready to serve again. The sync-kill animations make zooming in on combat a treat too.(Image credit: ArenaNet / NCSoft)Still secretly one of the best and most generous MMOs around, and one that most live service games could stand to learn a lesson from. From battle passes to update cadence, Guild Wars 2 has already solved most of the problems that other games-as-a-service developers are still trying to figure out.(Image credit: New Blood Interactive)The best of the new wave of retro shooters, Dusk one-ups the tight level design of the original Quake with creepy occult farms and the industrial hell dungeons that lurk beneath them. I guarantee it's going to get weirder and freakier than you expect, and the weapons all pop with simple, clean late-'90s power.(Image credit: CD Projekt Red)It's not without its problems, both technically and in scope, but there are enough genuinely brilliant moments in V's exploring of Night City that I can forgive it its shortcomings. The main storyline stands up well and there are plenty of brilliant sidequests that hint at a far bigger, more detailed experience.(Image credit: Oskar Stalberg)More a meditative little toy than a city builder, Townscaper is a little island of calm where I can get away from everything and while away the hours painting picturesque coastal towns. There are no tasks or discrete challenges: just a canvas and your own creativity. Townscaper proves that's all you need.Hey folks, beloved mascot Coconut Monkey here representing the collective PC Gamer editorial team, who worked together to write this article!See comments __Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake announcedIndian news channel uses Arma 3 gameplay footage to claim Pakistan bombed Afghanistan_ _ PC Gamer NewsletterSign up to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked by the editors.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsThank you for signing up to PC Gamer.

There is currently no prophylactic vaccine against chlamydia on the market and Eurocine Vaccines is developing a vaccine candidate based on a patented protein ( **read more**). At the same time, there is a need for better diagnostic tests in both Europe and the United States, to investigate if patients have or have undergone the disease and carry antibodies (Woodhall et al., Lancet Infect Dis 2018). According to our market analysis, such an improved test could be widely used for studies focusing on public health, for example to understand what proportion of the population has had chlamydia infection (so-called seroepidemiological studies), and to understand if previous chlamydia infection can be the cause of infertility. Therefore, Eurocine Vaccines has widened the license agreement with Spixia Biotechnology to alsoinclude a diagnostic test of chlamydia in order to evaluate it as an extension of its portfolio.Through the ongoing work to develop the manufacturing process for the active protein in the chlamydia vaccine candidate, which will primarily be used in further preclinical and clinical studies in the ongoing vaccine development, the company sees the opportunity for an additional application. The same protein can be the used for both the prophylactic vaccine and a diagnostic test of antibodies against chlamydia. This provides significant synergies in the form of documentation, process development, and protein manufacture, creating the opportunity for more products based on the same research and development.In the next step, initial experiments will be performed to evaluate a diagnostic test based on the active protein and how a future diagnostic product can best be designed. These trials are expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2022.\"It is completely in line with our strategy to actively seek additional opportunities to innovatively create added value based on our investments. Although the market potential is smaller for a diagnostic tool than for a vaccine, it is all about how to best contribute to modern healthcare based on our research and development\", comments Dr. Karl Ljungberg, Director of preclinical development.** Hans Arwidsson, Ph.D., MBA, CEO of Eurocine Vaccines AB,  +46 70 634 0171This information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comThe following files are available for download:Eurocine Vaccines extends its product portfolio with a diagnostic test of chlamydia through a widened agreement with Spixia Biotechnology  Bl\u00e5tt vatten mod  SOURCE Eurocine Vaccines###  Eurocine Vaccines\u00b4 Adjuvant Technology Endocine\u2122 is evaluated...More news releases in similar topicsfrom 8 AM - 9 PM ETMy Services ____Cision Distribution Helpline  Copyright \u00a9 2021 Cision US Inc."}

Our survey, which has a margin of sampling error for all respondents of plus or minus 5 percentage points, indicates that giving to racial and social justice is on the rise \u2013 especially among donors of color.We highlighted these findings in a recent report that also draws on insights from focus groups convened with diverse donors across the country and prior research.Giving to social and racial justice causes including groups tied to the Black Lives Matter movement, the Smithsonian\u2019s Latino Center and other cultural and arts institutions and colleges and universities primarily attended by Black, Indigenous and other students of color has grown in recent years. The share of Americans who said they are doing this rose from 12.6% in 2019 to 15.7% in 2020.Even larger shares of people within communities of color support these causes: 30.7% of Asian Americans, 19.3% of African Americans and 13.9% of Hispanic Americans donate to social and racial justice causes, compared with 12.6% of white people.In addition, we found that donors to social and racial justice causes are more likely to be single and young and less likely to attend religious services frequently compared with donors overall.Donors of color who fund charitable organizations also tend to give informally. For example, they were more likely to say that they give money and goods to their relatives and friends than were typical white donors.In addition, many Asian and Black people said they had donated more goods to others rather than money. Notably, from our research, we also see that African Americans are the most likely to give to strangers of all racial and ethnic groups, holding other variables constant.These findings reinforce earlier research regarding how donors of color often give directly to members of their communities, including people outside their families and circles of friends.U.S. philanthropists from marginalized groups have used giving as a means of self-help for people of color to fight racial oppression for centuries. For example, the African American entrepreneur Mary Ellen Pleasant helped finance the Underground Railroad.With the spike in anti-Asian racism that began when the COVID-19 pandemic arose, the Asian American community has started to give more to causes that tackle the root causes of discrimination and xenophobia. Many Asians are turning to crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe and to established charities to fund these efforts to stop hate crimes.One notable result: the 2021 launch of the Asian American Foundation, which advocates on behalf of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. By mid-2021 the new foundation said its funding had exceeded $1 billion.[ _Understand new developments in science, health and technology, each week._ Subscribe to The Conversation\u2019s science newsletter.]  * Global Challenges Podcast Series 2 -- Swansea, Swansea [Abertawe GB-ATA]  * IOE Impact Meet Ups Online: Professor Alissa Goodman CBE -- London , London, City of  * Beyond 6 Characteristics: EDI for the Modern University -- Lancaster , LancashirePrivacy policy Terms and conditions Corrections and complaintsCopyright (C) 2010\u20132021, The Conversation Trust (UK) Limited"}

For example, to name a few, the Government is to receive $55 million United States Dollars to reserve 15 million metric tonnes capacity for ArcelorMittal; and $10 million United States Dollars as signing bonus, for a total of $65 million United States Dollars.\"\"I am also informed that this extension and expansion will result in direct spending of about $200 million United States Dollars per year into the Liberian economy over the next several years. This should result in a significant increase in total Government revenue coming from the activities resulting from this Amendment. I am told that the project will create at least 1,000 direct jobs, 2000 temporary construction-related jobs, and about 4,000 indirect jobs, and that there will be an increase in the amount of money going to communities of impact in Nimba, Grand Bassa, and Bong counties,\" he said.But more importantly, an area which has been a point of contention is the muti-track use of the rail.\"Another important benefit, I have also been informed, is that this agreement opens up a multi-user rail system for the transport of goods and iron ore on the rail system.\"The ceremony was witnessed by president George Weah and Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal, Executive Chairman of Arcelor Mittal said.The new agreement if ratified by the legislature, will enable the company to invest US$800M. Already, the company's first 25 years agreement(signed in 2005) has nine more years remaining.The new agreement means it will triple its iron ore production. \"Our commitment is very strong. We will be expanding our mining operations - in the first phase tripling our current production levels to 15 million tonnes a year,\" Mittal said.Mr. Mittal earlier said: \"We are also exploring the potential to go beyond that - up to 30 million tonnes a year. The product will also be higher quality and to deliver this premium quality we will be constructing a new concentration plant - with the first concentrate expected in late 2023.\"Many people from the operation areas have expressed their unhappiness over the performance. This led to a strike action which resulted into the burning of some of equipment and subsequent arrest during the regime of former president , madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.The resumption of president Weah's government led to a call for renegotiation which lasted for two years.Mittal said, \"To deliver on this potential, we will again need to enhance the infrastructure - for example increasing the capacity of the rail link connecting Tokadeh with Buchanan, as well as with the port of Buchanan.\"It is a very ambitious plan and one that we at ArcelorMittal are very excited about. But, ultimately, we hope that it is the people of Liberia that will benefit most from this agreement.The expansion of our operations is expected to generate thousands of jobs for the local population during the construction and operating phases.\"#### Sign up for free AllAfrica NewslettersGet the latest in African news delivered straight to your inboxTop HeadlinesLiberiaLegal AffairsMiningBy submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.We need to confirm your email address.To complete the process, please follow the instructions in the email we just sent you.There was a problem processing your submission.

[via press release from WarnerMedia]  WarnerMedia Kids & Family Rolls Out Voice Cast for \"Batwheels\"Ethan Hawke, Jacob Bertrand and AJ Hudson Lead Stellar Voice Cast for First DC Preschool Animated Series Produced by Warner Bros. AnimationAJ Hudson Voices First On Screen Portrayal of Duke Thomas - the First Black Robin in DCBurbank, CA (Sept. 13, 2021) - WarnerMedia Kids & Family announced today the voice cast for the upcoming Warner Bros. Animation series Batwheels. Ethan Hawke (The Good Lord Bird) as Batman and Jacob Bertrand (Cobra Kai) as Bam the Batmobile lead a talented cast for the preschool animated action-adventure comedy series featuring the most heroic and iconic vehicles from the DC universe.The announcement was made by Bertrand during a special virtual event celebrating the launch of Cartoonito, WarnerMedia Kids & Family's new preschool programming block available on HBO Max and Cartoon Network. He was also joined by Batwheels cast mate AJ Hudson (The Good Place) who voices the character of Duke Thomas, the first Black character to don the Robin \"R\" in the pages of DC comics. Batwheels represents the first on screen portrayal of the character.The main characters and voice cast includes:The Batwheels Team* Jacob Bertrand (Cobra Kai) as Bam - The Batmobile and leader of the Batwheels team. Like his hero Batman, Bam has a strong sense of justice and tries his best to lead the team, even though he's not always sure he's up for the task. Ultimately, the other Batwheels know they can count on him, both as a super teammate, and as a friend. Jacob Bertrand is represented by Jack Kingsrud/Zero Gravity Management, Kevin Hussey/ICM and Chad Christopher at Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher. * Jordan Reed (Chuggington) as Redbird - Robin's zippy sports car. \"Red\" is the kid brother of the team, always eager to prove himself a worthy sidekick to Bam but he can definitely hold his own on a mission. He's enthusiastic and extremely inquisitive, asking tons of questions, like a kid detective. * Madigan Kacmar (Chuggington) as Bibi - Batgirl's brave and bold motorcycle. She is the fastest of the Batwheels, but also the smallest, so she sometimes has a habit of being impulsive and jumping right into the action without a plan. Madigan Kacmar is represented by Bonnie Shumofsky Bloom at Stewart Talent Agency. * Noah Bentley (Elliott from Earth) as Buff - This Bat-styled monster truck is the team's muscle and can ram through or run over any obstacle in his path, but he's also the heart of the team - a gentle giant who doesn't really know his own strength. Noah Bentley is represented by CESD. * Lilimar (Cleopatra in Space) as Batwing - Batman's supersonic jet plane, \"Wing\" is easily the most sophisticated, and confident member of the team. Lilimar is represented by CESD and LINK. * Kimberly D. Brooks (DC Super Hero Girls) as The Batcomputer - She is the supervisor, dispatcher, and trainer of the team - but most importantly she is also their mother figure. In addition to training and advising them, she must be there to comfort them and even hold their mechanical hands when needed. Kimberly D. Brooks is represented by Cynthia McLean at SBV Talent. * Mick Wingert (What If?) as Moe - Batman's robot repairman who facilitates repairs and upkeep on his fleet of vehicles. He is well-equipped, highly efficient mechanic who can fix almost any vehicular glitch, but not without a healthy dose of sarcasm. Mick Wingert is represented by Heather Dame at Atlas Talent Agency. * Ethan Hawke (The Good Lord Bird) as Batman - Gotham City's greatest protector who keeps the streets safe from any and all threats. Even though Batman doesn't communicate directly with the Batwheels, he acts as a father figure. They absolutely seek his approval and trust while they fight alongside him. Ethan Hawke is represented by CAA, MGMT Entertainment and ID. * AJ Hudson (The Good Place) as Duke Thomas/Robin - The Boy Wonder who loves sinking his teeth into a great detective mystery while he strives to prove himself alongside Batman. AJ Hudson is represented by Abbie Waters from Osbrink Agency and Tanesia Tramell from Eleven 7 Artist Management. * Leah Lewis (Nancy Drew) as Cassandra Cain/Batgirl - The first Asian-American Batgirl as first introduced in the comics. In Batwheels Cassandra is the \"big sister\", tech-savvy daredevil of the Bat-Family. She loves ripping around the streets of Gotham City on her motorcycle and always wants to be in the center of the action. Leah Lewis is represented by Commercial Talent Agency, Paradigm, Strong Management, Morris, Yorn, Barnes, Levine, Krintzman, Rubenstein, Kohner & Gellman. Additional cast and characters will be announced at a later time.They are a team of incredible crimefighters who have banded together to oppose evil, combat crime and clean up the streets of Gotham City. They are... okay, they're NOT Batman and Robin. They're the Batwheels - an awesome group of sentient super-powered crime-fighting vehicles defending Gotham City alongside Batman, Robin, Batgirl and a host of DC Super Heroes.Having just been created by the Batcomputer, our heroes are essentially kids with little to no life experience. Led by Bam (The Batmobile), the Batwheels - Bibi (The Batgirl Cycle), Redbird (Robin's Sports Car), The Batwing and Buff (The Bat Truck) - must navigate the growing pains of being a newly formed super team as well as the growing pains that come with just being a kid. This relatable and aspirational series will follow the journey of this dynamic team as they thrill and entertain with their heroic adventures as well as demonstrate to kids the value of self-confidence, friendship and teamwork.Batwheels is produced by Warner Bros. Animation. Sam Register (Looney Tunes Cartoons) serves as executive producer. Michael G. Stern (Doc McStuffins) serves as co-executive producer, Simon J.

The day marked a major advancement for the Firefly team, as we demonstrated that we \u2018arrived\u2019 as a company capable of building and launching rockets,\u201d said Tom Markusic, CEO of Firefly Aerospace. \u201cAlthough the vehicle did not reach orbit, we acquired a wealth of flight data that will greatly enhance the likelihood of Alpha achieving orbit during its second flight. In short, we had a very successful first flight.\u201dThe test began with a nominal countdown and lift off at 6:59 PM PDT and achieved a successful first stage ignition, liftoff from the pad, and progression to supersonic speed. During the flight the launch vehicle experienced an anomaly that resulted in a safe termination of flight by the Range using the Flight Termination System (FTS). Initial review of flight data indicates that an electrical issue caused the shutdown of one of the four first stage Reaver engines. Firefly is conducting a thorough anomaly investigation and will report root cause of the anomaly at the end of this investigation.As stated on September 2nd by Space Launch Delta 30 the Alpha rocket was terminated \u201cover the Pacific Ocean at 7:01 p.m. Pacific Time after a successful lift off at 6:59 p.m. \u2026. There were no injuries associated with the anomaly.\u201dDuring the two minutes and twenty-five seconds of flight Firefly obtained a substantial amount of flight data that will be utilized to improve the design of future Alpha launch vehicles, including the second flight vehicle, which is currently being integrated for flight at their Briggs, Texas manufacturing and test facility.Markusic also stated, \u201cFirefly has been incredibly fortunate to have partners that share our vision and passion. The most difficult and perilous days of Firefly Aerospace were funded by Noosphere Ventures, founded by Max Polyakov. Early on, Max and I created the technological and business development roadmap \u2013 the first launch of Alpha being a hard-fought landmark achievement for the entire team.\u201d He continued, \u201cThe Alpha launch vehicle was developed by a world-class group of talented and dedicated technical directors. Firefly\u2019s Flight and Test Operations Department, led by Anne Chinnery, Brad Obrocto, and Sean Reilly, built Firefly\u2019s launch facility and successfully conducted the first launch.\u201dDr. Max Polyakov, Firefly\u2019s Co-Founder said, \u201cAlpha\u2019s first launch was a historic day for Firefly. I salute and thank the team that has worked so hard to make the vision of Firefly a reality. In just four years, Firefly has developed and flown an orbital class launch vehicle and is building our Blue Ghost lunar lander to go to the Moon in 2023 -- incredible accomplishments for such a short time!\u201dFirefly also thanks their partners at DADA Holdings, Astera Institute, Canon Ball LLC, Reuben Brothers Limited, SMS Capital Investment LLC, Raven One Ventures, XBTO Ventures, Republic Capital and other investors for their support.Firefly acknowledges the outstanding support provided by the United States Space Force through Space Launch Delta 30 at Vandenberg Space Force Base and by the FAA. Alpha Flight 1 was a great example of private-public partnership.Video of Firefly Alpha FLTA001 launch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFjoPw0CfAUFirefly is developing a family of launch and in-space vehicles and services that provide industry-leading affordability, convenience, and reliability. Firefly\u2019s launch vehicles utilize common technologies, manufacturing infrastructure and launch capabilities, providing LEO launch solutions for up to ten metric tons of payload at the lowest cost per kg in the small-launch class. Combined with Firefly\u2019s in-space vehicles, such as the Space Utility Vehicle and Blue Ghost Lunar Lander, Firefly provides the space industry with a single source for missions from LEO to the surface of the Moon or beyond.

Learn more# Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak announces private space venture 'unlike the others'By  John Loeffler 14 September 2021Privateer to 'keep space safe and accessible to all humankind'  *   *   *   *   *   * __(Image credit: Privateer Space)Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Ripcord Inc. founder Alex Fielding announced a new space company, Privateer, which aims to \"keep space safe and accessible for all humankind.\"Wozniak, who co-founded Apple in April 1976 with Steve Jobs, isn't new to launching new ventures of all sorts \u2013 he's been doing that over the years \u2013 so a private space company isn't totally out of step for him. That said, there's no indication yet what Privateer aims to achieve actually.> A Private space company is starting up, unlike the others. https://t.co/6s8J32mjuFSeptember 13, 2021The company does plan to provide more details in private group sessions at the upcoming AMOS conference this week, presumably with potential investors, according to Space Explored.The new company did release a trailer of sorts announcing itself, which may provide some clue as to its purpose, including footage of past rocket launches and spaceflights, something that looks like a burning crash test dummy with a missing arm, a rotating space station, and an assortment of fire-streaked asteroids threatening to ruin someone's day for sure.## Analysis: what the heck is Woz getting up to now?On the one hand, another private space company entering the fray is getting so passe that it barely qualifies as news at all.Private space operations are starting to heat up, with several new startups like Firefly Aerospace coming onto the scene in recent years aimed at providing low cost, small satellite launch services for the broader public beyond just government agencies, various militaries, and the handful of private businesses who already have a presence in low-earth orbit.On the other hand, Wozniak is involved with this one, which does raise our level of interest. What makes his involvement notable is that Wozniak has a reputation for being a tech geek's tech geek. While Steve Jobs gets the lion's share of the accolades as Apple's pioneer-in-chief (not undeservedly), Wozniak has always been the one behind the stage with the soldering iron and screwdriver over an open computer case.While Steve Job's sold the public on the Apple II personal computer and revolutionized the world, Wozniak was the chief designer of the computer itself, and has gone in the years since to become something of a public advocate for issues like net neutrality, right to repair, and open access technology. He is most definitely not the \"Money Guy\" in the room, and in the private space venture sector, the money guys dominate. We have no clue what Woz is up to, but we are most definitely intrigued.  * Stay up to date on all the latest tech news with the TechRadar newsletterJohn (He / Him / His) is TechRadar's Computing Staff Writer and is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.

Over the years, Netflix has released selective snapshots into its viewership. Here's what we believe to be the best-maintained list of every Netflix viewership statistic released so far as of May 2021.**With the new age of streaming, viewership metrics have gone by the wayside. Instead, we get selective \"datecdotes\" (a phrase coined by the Entertainment Strategy Guy) that gives us a glimpse into viewing figures of certain titles. Netflix is by far the best when it comes to releasing metrics when it comes to streamers but even then, it's often criticized.With thanks to the \"data squad\" on Twitter who helps us find all the new data released by Netflix including The Entertainment Strategy Guy, The Netflix Film Project, Films De Lovers, Brandon Katz from Observer, and Julia Alexander from IGN.### Top 10 Most Watched Netflix Originals (according to Netflix released figures)In terms of the top 10 most-watched titles in Netflix history (using first month metrics, not lifetime), here they are:#### English Language Netflix Original Movie Top 10  1. Extraction - 99 million views  2. Bird Box - 89 million views  3. Spenser Confidential - 85 million views  4. 6 Underground - 83 million views  5. Murder Mystery - 83 million views  6. The Old Guard - 78 million views  7. Enola Holmes - 76 million views  8. Project Power - 75 million views  9. Army of the Dead - 75 million views  10. Fatherhood - 74 million views#### English Language Netflix Original TV Shows Top 10  1. Bridgerton S1 - 82 million views  2. The Witcher S1 - 76 million views  3. Stranger Things S3 - 64 million views  4. Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness - 64 million views  5. The Queen's Gambit - 62 million views  6. Sweet Tooth - 60 million views  7. Emily in Paris - 58 million views  8. Fate: The Winx Saga - 57 million views  9. Shadow and Bone - 55 million views  10. You S2 - 54 million views_Note: we 've excluded Money Heist S3 and Airplane Mode which would've ranked in this list but the stats provided are 70%, not 2-minutes._  1. Lupin S1 & S2 (French) - 70 million views & 54 million views respectively  2. Money Heist S4 (Spanish) - 65 million views  3. The Platform (Portuguese) - 56 million views  4. Who Killed Sara? (Spanish - Mexico) - 55 & 34 million views respectively  5. Below Zero (Spanish) - 47 million views  6. Barbarians (German) - 37 million views  7. Lost Bullet (French) - 37 million views  8. Elite S4 (Spanish) - 37 million views  9. Dark Desire (Spanish) - 35 million views  10. Squared Love (Polish) - 31 million viewsWithout further ado, here's a list of every metric Netflix has announced so far which we'll keep updated over time.How does Netflix measure viewership? Up until 2020, Netflix's viewership figures in the past counted where a user watched 70% of the movie/series. Now, viewership counts if someone watches two minutes of a title. It did offer up a comparison between the new and old metric which allows us to do an adjusted viewership rate although there are major caveats to that.## Full List of Viewership Totals for Netflix Series & Movies_Note: all of the below are 2-minute stats._**Released on Netflix:** August 27th, 2021  **Number of Viewers:** 55 million (estimated)Alongside the announcement of TikTok star Addison Rae signing a new film deal with Netflix they also dropped an estimation for the new rom-com that did horribly in reviews but apparently well in viewership.**Released on Netflix:** June 4th, 2021  The DC comic book show struck a chord with Netflixers despite being aimed towards younger audiences.#### _The Sons of Sam: A Descent into Darkness_**Released on Netflix:** May 5th, 2021  #### _The Circle_ (Seasons 1 & 2)**Released on Netflix:** January 1st, 2020 & April 2021  **Number of Viewers:** 29,000,000 & 14,000,000 respectively**Released on Netflix:** June 18th, 2021  **Released on Netflix:** April 30th, 2021  Scored the accolade at the time of being the biggest animation feature film release for Netflix.**Released on Netflix:** June 18th, 2021  Notably up over previous seasons.**Released on Netflix:** May 19th, 2021  Down from 55M for season 1.**Released on Netflix:** April 23rd, 2021  Alongside the renewal of Shadow and Bone came the announcement that _Shadow and Bone_ has broken into the top 10 most-watched TV shows on Netflix.> Shadow and Bone has been renewed for Season 2!> More than 55 million member households chose to watch the epic fantasy series in its first 28 days (via @NetflixGeeked) pic.twitter.com/MT5dGdY8gh> -- Netflix (@netflix) June 7, 2021**Released on Netflix:** May 21st, 2021  **Statistic Announced:** May 28th, 2021 (predicted stat) - July 20th, 2021 (actual)  **Number of viewers:** 72,000,000 (predicted) - 75,000,000 (actual)Zack Snyder has been on a tear in 2021 with the release of the revised Justice League and his return to the zombie genre for Netflix.> 72 million households are betting on dead.> ARMY OF THE DEAD has been the #1 film around the world and is projected to be one of Netflix\u2019s most popular films ever in its first 4 weeks. pic.twitter.com/85foTPFAny> -- NetflixFilm (@NetflixFilm) May 28, 2021**Released on Netflix:** October 2nd, 2020  Cited as the \"most popular comedy in 2020\", this statistic came alongside the announcement that filming had begun on season 2.**Released on Netflix:** September 11th, 2020  This is the lowest figure released to the public thus far albeit with the caveat that it was said by the creator and lead actress of the show, not Netflix.#### _Firefly Lane_**Released on Netflix:** February 3rd, 2021  **Statistic announced:** April 20th, 2021 (Q1 2021 investor letter)  **Released on Netflix:** January 22nd, 2021  **Statistic announced:** April 20th, 2021 (Q1 2021 investor letter)  **Released on Netflix:** February 24th, 2021  **Statistic announced:** April 20th, 2021 (Q1 2021 investor letter)  **Released on Netflix:** January 15th, 2021  **Statistic announced:** April 20th, 2021 (Q1 2021 investor letter)  **Released on Netflix:** February 19th, 2021  **Statistic announced:** April 20th, 2021 (Q1 2021 investor letter)  #### _To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before 3_**Released on Netflix:** February 12th, 2021  **Statistic announced:** April 20th, 2021 (Q1 2021 investor letter)  **Released on Netflix:** February 5th, 2021  **Statistic announced:** April 20th, 2021 (Q1 2021 investor letter)  **Released on Netflix:** February 11th, 2021  **Statistic announced:** April 20th, 2021 (Q1 2021 investor letter)  **Released on Netflix:** March 20th, 2021  **Statistic announced:** April 20th, 2021 (Q1 2021 investor letter)  This title was also mentioned to be \"our most popular non-English title ever in the US in its first 28 days\".**Released on Netflix:** March 12th, 2021  **Number of viewers:** 53,000,000 (later revised up to 62,000,000 in the Q1 2021 investor letter)Family movies have been doing remarkably well on Netflix as of late and this estimated figure suggests the new Jennifer Garner picture did quite well despite receiving mediocre reviews.Released on Netflix:** January 29th, 2021  **Number of viewers:** 46,000,000 (revised up to 47,000,000 in the Q1 investor letter)**Released on Netflix:** January 20th, 2021  Netflix's expansion into Mexican productions was seen to be paying dividends with this comedy sitcom series reportedly reaching 23 million households.

The Spanish version was the most-watched according to this report.**Released on Netflix:** April 24th, 2020  **Number of viewers:** 90,000,000 original projection / 99,000,000 actual later confirmedThe Chris Hemsworth movie topped all charts when it was revealed in early May that the action-packed thrill ride scored the biggest film premiere for Netflix thus far.The projected 90 million views are for the first four weeks of release.#### _Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness_**Released on Netflix:** March 6th, 2020  The year is 2020 and there are two things you can't stop hearing about in the early parts of the year. The coronavirus and the _Tiger King._This documentary took the world by storm but that's not necessarily reflected in the viewing figures. That's not giving _Tiger King_ its dues though, as it's still the most-watched docu-series on Netflix.**Released on Netflix:** April 3rd, 2020  The Spanish series continues to be Netflix's darling series as it racks up an impressive 65M projected views around the globe.Adjusted to the pre-2 minute metric, it has pulled in about as much the same as _Money Heist_ part three, but that's likely not a fair comparison.**Released on Netflix:** February 13th, 2020  _Love is Blind_ sets a new benchmark for reality TV series on Netflix as it's the first metric we've had from the genre.**Released on Netflix:** March 6th, 2020  **Released on Netflix:** March 27th, 2020  This is the first time we've been given a glimpse into the streaming numbers for _Ozark._The excellent drama is often compared to _Breaking Bad_ and is easily one of the shining jewels in the Netflix Original drama crown.This number translates into one of the biggest shows for Netflix given it can command such a strong number in its third season. It beats _Stranger Things_ S3 (although that's based on the old metric) although it's five million shy of _Money Heist 's_ third season.**Released on Netflix:** January 23rd, 2020  In February 2020, Netflix announced that the Portuguese movie, _Airplane Mode_ is the most popular non-English movie the streamer has produced thus far.In a Tweet on February 27th, 2020 Netflix said the following:> AIRPLANE MODE is the most popular non-English film on Netflix so far! Nearly 28 million households watched the film since it premiered four weeks ago \u2014 two thirds of them in countries including the US, Mexico, France and Germany.**Released on Netflix:** January 17th, 2020  Tyler Perry's _A Fall From Grace_ was a thriller movie that quietly dropped on Netflix in the first month of the year.Promotion for this title was nowhere near the level of some of the other titles on this list so it demonstrates how a title can do well purely based on word of mouth and the famous algorithm.It got massive views despite having some awful reviews particularly from critics where it sits at 34/100.> I HAD TO SAY THIS ABOUT A FALL FROM GRACE! Thank you to the 26 million of you who chose to watch in the first week! #AFallFromGrace @netflix @NetflixFilm @strongblacklead pic.twitter.com/JQPkuVmRPN> -- Tyler Perry (@tylerperry) February 3, 2020**Released on Netflix:** December 20th, 2019  Based on the novel series and video game of the same name, we knew _The Witcher_ was going to be big from the early days. Each of the trailers consistently was the highest viewed on Netflix's YouTube channel and people were looking for their next _Game of Thrones_ fix.When Netflix released this stat (which saw the series added to the top five most-watched titles in Netflix history) it also noted how the book series also was struggling to keep up with the new demand.**Released on Netflix:** December 20th, 2019  Despite relatively mediocre reviews, the movie was sure to be a big hit given the fact it combines Ryan Reynolds with explosions, all wrapped up in an easy to digest format.This metric covers the first four weeks of viewing.**Released on Netflix:** December 26th, 2019  Twelve million more people watched season two of _You_ than season one in its first four weeks, which shows the series has the legs to keep audiences interested and has attracted more viewers long after the initial release of _You_.It's worth noting that only several weeks of data were available to Netflix and this number is based on their estimates.**Released on Netflix:** November 17th, 2019  Netflix's golden series _The Crown_ which covers the life of Queen Elizabeth finally got some stats revealed in early 2020. The show's statistics had previously not been known.Additional viewership insights were also provided. This includes the fact 73 million people in total have chosen to watch at least one episode of _The Crown_. It also revealed that the viewership of season three was 40% up over season two.All the titles listed below are on Netflix's old metric which is measured based on 70% of the show/movie being watched.**Released on Netflix:** November 11th, 2019  It's a personal pleasure to see _Klaus_ doing well. The animated holiday movie is spectacularly animated and we've heard was passed on by multiple studios. At least for us, it's going to be a yearly tradition diving into the movie. It's worth noting the 30 million number is technically at the top end and the stat covers the first month, not the first seven days.Beyond a Nielson number for _The Christmas Chronicles_ (which appears to have had more viewers than _Klaus_ _)_ , this is the first metric Netflix has released for a Christmas title.> This holiday season, join the nearly 30 million households around the world who enjoyed Klaus in its first four weeks on Netflix! pic.twitter.com/lIo5X9dRkP> -- Netflix Queue (@netflixqueue) December 19, 2019**Released on Netflix:** November 27th, 2019  **Number of viewers:** 26,404,081 (70% - first week) - 64,000,000 (2 minutes - first month)  Netflix spent hundreds of millions on _The Irishman_ which looks to be its best chance yet at getting its first movie Oscar.Speculation as to whether _The Irishman_ would have its stats revealed have been ongoing for weeks given the size of the project.Given the length, that's an extraordinary number given that you have to watch 70% of the movie to be considered within that number.> *pours glass of wine*> *dips bread*> My friends, I\u2019ve got some news from the big guy at the top: THE IRISHMAN was watched by 26,404,081 accounts globally \u2014 within its first 7 days on Netflix. pic.twitter.com/abVV993CWS> -- NetflixFilm (@NetflixFilm) December 10, 2019#### The House of Flowers (Season 2)**Released on Netflix:** October 18th, 2019  **Number of viewers:** 6,219,547 - first-week metricReleased on Netflix:** October 11th, 2019  This French movie released in October 2019 proves that Netflix is making a dent in individual countries.

Seventy-three million households in total watched _Murder Mystery_ in the first month.Murder Mystery - Adam Sandler's biggest Netflix movie to date**Released on Netflix:** May 31st, 2019  The Ali Wong and Randall Park comedy could likely attribute some of its success thanks to the memes surrounding the cameo of Keanu Reeves. Nevertheless, it's another popular romantic comedy that saw nearly one in five subscribers at the time watch.

We should also note Netflix said \"most-watched series in the U.S. every day since through at least June 12\".In a later report, we learned that some of the regions that particularly enjoyed _When They See Us_ including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Benelux countries, and Africa.When They See Us - Netflix Limited Series**Released on Netflix:** May 3rd, 2019  The debut black comedy series starring Christina Applegate and Linda Cardellini struck a chord early on with Netflix watchers around the world.

That represents just shy of half of every Netflix subscriber.**Released on Netflix:** March 29th, 2019  Despite mixed reviews, this period biographical drama still scored over 40 million viewers. At the time, that was almost a quarter of the entire subscriber base in the first month.**Released on Netflix:** March 13th, 2019  Worldwide and viewing figures for the first 30 days. The action hit for Netflix featured an all-star cast and is currently, according to the released metrics at least, the third most-watched movie.**Released on Netflix:** February 15th, 2019  Until _Umbrella Academy_ , Netflix's superhero series output was entirely reliant on Marvel. _Umbrella Academy_ 's sweeping success proves that Netflix can promote superhero content that isn't from Marvel or DC.

We asked leaders in the field about the most promising advancements that could lead to a hairier future for all of us.By Beth ShapouriAugust 31, 2021 _This story is a part of_ _The Truth About Hair Loss_ _, an exploration into why we lose our hair, the emotional and monetary costs that come along with the experience, and what the future of treatment (and acceptance) could look like._Even before the pandemic hit, the hair restoration industry was booming (it's projected to reach over $12 billion in 2026). Add in the stress-included hair loss that we\u2019ve seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, and suddenly all eyes are on the scalp.It may be surprising that, in a market set to see significant growth in the next few years, we're arguably lacking in great solutions to the problem \u2014 particularly for women, who aren't always candidates for all the treatments currently available to men. In fact, of the two FDA-approved drugs on the hair rejuvenation market, minoxidil and finasteride (aka Rogaine and Propecia, respectively), only Rogaine is also approved for women. But with advances in technology and other innovations on the horizon, that all may change in the next few years.##  **Why is treating hair loss so hard?**First, hair loss is notoriously persistent. Beyond that, it comes down in large part to the fact that it may happen for a variety of reasons (among them: thyroid and metabolism troubles and possibly air pollution) that may require different solutions. Temporary hair loss, caused by events like chemotherapy, stress, or post-pregnancy, may clear up on its own once circumstances change. But other types require intervention to see improvement: For example, the autoimmune disorder alopecia areata may be treated with immunotherapy or with injected and topical corticosteroids. For your average case of male or female pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia), there are a few options that have varying degrees of results and costs associated with them, and with some come the chance of unsexy side effects (see: finasteride's erectile dysfunction). And while researchers continue to study the underlying causes of hair loss, there hasn\u2019t been a drug approved to combat it since 1997.For people assigned female at birth, finding the right solution \u2014 or solutions \u2014 can be especially hard. \"In general, male hair loss is mainly caused by the hormone DHT (dihydrotestosterone) which causes hair to progressively thin (miniaturize) over each successive growth cycle,\" says Christine M. Shaver, a board-certified dermatologist at Bernstein Medical Center for Hair Restoration in New York. \"Thus, the main treatment for male hair loss is through simply blocking the formation of DHT.\" While DHT is also a factor for women, Shaver says that in this group overall \"hair loss is more complex [so it] can prove quite difficult to treat.\" Simply blocking the hormone often isn't enough \u2014 plus, the main way of doing it, finasteride, hasn't been approved for women. Not that it doesn't work \u2014 studies show it can \u2014 but there are enough potential safety concerns for women who are pregnant (or may become pregnant), breast-feeding, or have a family history of breast cancer that the FDA considersit a no-go.Then there's the fact that women aren't often great candidates for scalp hair transplants. Shaver explains that the way that hair loss typically occurs in women is to blame, as it's commonly diffused all over the scalp rather than concentrated in one bald patch. \"This poses an issue with hair transplant because the donor hair in hair transplant at the back and sides of the scalp must be stable and not thinning,\" she says. If it isn\u2019t, it will continue to thin once implanted.##  **The Current Hair Loss Treatment Landscape**Before we get into what's on the horizon, here's a quick rundown of the major options available now: First, there is surgical hair transplant, which may or may not be done with robotic assistance, and, again, isn't always an option for women. Another in-office offering is platelet-rich plasma (PRP) scalp injections, in which platelets are separated out from a patient's own blood, and then injected back into the scalp, which offers moderate results in some people.Looking beyond minoxidil (which has been proven to be somewhat beneficial for both men and women), topically you have serums and the like, which mostly get not-so-great reviews from the experts we spoke with, though there are some exceptions. For instance, Samuel M. Lam, MD, facial plastic and hair restoration surgeon in Plano, TX, and the administrative chair of the multimedia committee for the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery \u2014 reported success with redensyl, a topical he's found so effective, he formulated his own serum for brows and lashes with it called Folliflo.In addition to finasteride in the oral category, you have supplements, some of which, like Nutrafol, get namechecked by from experts as beneficial for some. However, Shaver points out, \"There is little scientific support behind the ability of vitamins and supplements to promote hair growth unless the patient has a nutritional deficiency that needs to be corrected.\"\u200b\u200bAnother option is low-level laser (aka cold laser) therapy devices, caps, or wands, which \"aim to stimulate the hair follicle and cause hair growth,\" says Shaver. In theory, they may provide some help, but \"practically speaking, they often do not provide much improvement when patients try these devices.\" Furthermore, many of the devices on the market don't have the correct wavelength or strength to get results, adds Lam.And a note about hair pieces: There have been many advances in toupees and lace-front hairpieces and wigs that make hiding hair loss easier \u2014 and pretty much undetectable. But none of the hairstylists we spoke with offered them up as a long-term solution for someone dealing with permanent hair loss. When it comes to hair, people really want it to be home-grown.## **The Rise of the Clones (and Robots)**Looking to the future, bioengineered hair \u2014 or hair cloning, as it's more commonly referred to \u2014 was by far the top innovation named by the experts we spoke with as the one to watch. And it's been a long-time coming. Says Yael Halaas, a board-certified facial plastic surgeon, \"Every 10 years I tell my patients we are closer to cloning and growing hair in a laboratory. And every 10 years we are getting closer.\" Sara Wasserbauer, a board-certified hair restoration surgeon of California Hair Surgeons with locations in San Jose, San Francisco, Walnut Creek, and Napa, explains the cloning can happen two ways, either by replicating hairs in a lab or by cloning the _cells_ that make the hair. Cloning is the hair rejuvenation industry's big hope because, Lam explains, \"Once we have unlimited donor supply, we can easily rebuild a [patient's hair].\" And that includes anyone with overall hair thinning, rather than a single bald patch.As of now, \"we have studies that show hair regeneration from stem cells in mice, but so far no clinical studies to support efficacy in humans,\" says board-certified plastic and hair surgeon Gary Linkov of City Facial Plastics in New York City. But a team of scientists in Japan, led by Takashi Tsuji, is currently awaiting the start of a clinical trial to test cultured hair follicles in humans, so all eyes will be on the results.Linkov, who currently prefers to do hair implantation by hand or via motorized equipment, predicts that when we have cloning, we'll also have better robots to help with the transplants. He says, \"I envision a time when the surgeon can harvest a few hairs from a person, send it to a company for expansion into thousands of grafts and then plug those grafts into a machine that would perform the transplant.\"The second-most name-checked therapy on the horizon is the use of exosomes, which use the same mRNA technology seen in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Explains Wasserbauer, \"Exosomes contain mRNA, which is the same type of 'messenger RNA' that COVID-19 vaccines are using to tell cells what to do to recognize the virus. Messenger RNA can tell a cell to do many different things like grow, shrink, or produce a certain protein.\" Halaas (who co-authored a paper reviewing its therapeutic potential) calls it \"by far the most exciting treatment in recent years.\"Exosomes are administered via injection, so it's a low-pain option, and patients will likely require maintenance injections once or twice a year. But many are hopeful it could be a good solution. Wasserbauer says, \"Everyone in the hair medicine community is anxious to see results of the scientific trials.\"There are two innovations getting buzz on the cusp of finishing clinical trials overseas. First, there's a drug called FOL-005 that's being developed for men by the biotech company Follicum. It features osteopontin, a protein in hair which may stimulate or inhibit hair growth, depending on the derivative (Follicum claims to have isolated a stimulating one). It has been studied in injections and is now being looked at in topical form. Linkov calls it \"promising for now, but time will tell its safety and effectiveness in humans as their clinical trials proceed.\"Another topical with growing buzz, thanks to its ability in trials to antagonize DHT without serious adverse effects, is Breezula, an anti-androgen made by the pharmaceutical company Cassiopea. Explains Halaas, \"Because it works on DHT locally, we are hoping we will see good results without the side effects of Propecia.\" So far its trials have been done on men but the company is currently studying its use for women.While this therapy is currently not considered a go-to treatment \u2014 in fact, Shaver predicted a slow turn away from laser therapy, calling it \"underwhelming\" for most patients \u2014 some of the experts we spoke with see the potential for big advances in this area.The thinking here is that as devices (used both at-home and in-offices) get better and deliver the type of light that provides results, the before/afters will become more dramatic. Wasserbauer\u2019s take: \"Low-level light therapy has been dosed improperly for decades.\" The idea that the optimal number of photons of the right wavelength, direction, strength, as well as the correct time on the head will be found \u2014 and can be delivered at home \u2014 is exciting because \"it's drug-free and boosts the efficacy of other hair loss treatments, even exosomes presumably,\" she says.Cloning, robots, mRNA technology, and suped-up laser caps \u2014 they all show promise. In reality, whatever technologies may come, patients will likely mix and match them to find their perfect regime. That means hair rejuvenation may end up looking like something out of a sci-fi movie. Can't say we didn't see that coming. **Read more from The Truth About Hair Loss:**Embracing the Beauty of Being BaldWhy This Common Form Of Hair Loss in Black Women Is Often MisdiagnosedWhat It's Like to Lose Your Hair in Your 20s **Now watch one woman 's seven-step wash day routine:** _Follow Allure on_ _Instagram_ _and_ _Twitter_ _, or_ _subscribe to our newsletter_ _to stay up to date on all things beauty._Keywordshair lossThe Truth About Hair Losshair loss treatmentsciencefeatureMore from Allure  * Do Not Sell My Personal Info\u00a9 2021 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Thank you!Learn more._ **REVIEW:** The THRUNITE BSS V4 flashlight has a turbo mode that might be called \u2018cigarette lighter mode\u2019, so be careful. But there are plenty of modes and functions so, once the hand learns its way around this medium size light you have a lot of lumen power at your disposal. Or, very little light, if that\u2019s all you need. The BSS V4 covers a very wide variety of lighting requirements.The THRUNITE BSS V4 flashlight is a multi-mode, rechargeable, LED flashlight.  * Measurements: 5.25\u201d Length, 15/16\u201d Diameter at lens  * Light output lumens: Firefly .54, Low 33, Medium 350, High 1426 \u2013 634, Turbo 2523 -614.  * Runtime: Firefly 56 days, Low 55 hours + 42 mins, Medium 4.5 hours, High 130 seconds + 150 minutes, Turbo 125 seconds + 147 minutes  * Weight: (pocket clip attached, defense bezel removed) 5.0 ounces.I was sent what I\u2019ll call the \u2018Splash-paint Camo\u2019 version of the BSS V4. I don\u2019t see the camo version at Amazon but it\u2019s at Thrunite.com for $79.99 ($64.99 for black or desert tan).The light has 6 lighting modes including strobe (3 side button presses for strobe, which is not in the directions). There are 3 low, medium and high brightnesses, with Firefly, strobe and turbo being the other 3 modes.The Firefly mode is interesting. It is the lowest lumen setting of all the flashlights I\u2019ve known and loved. It produces such low power it\u2019s about equivalent to the amount of light coming from one of my single AAA flashlights when it\u2019s way past time to replace the battery. But it has actually been a very useful feature.The lens assembly and tail cap are intentionally loose during shipping to avoid battery drain. Screw those down to normal tightness, charge the battery to full capacity then start using it. Remove the defense bezel or keep it in place, and/or add the red lens filter if desired.How to activate the strobe mode is not mentioned in the instruction sheet or Thrunite website. Again, 3 presses of the side switch gets you to strobe mode.Without the pocket clip attached I was unable to discern the on-off side switch from the charging port unless I was looking at the flashlight. Better tactile differentiation of the switch would be mighty useful.With the pocket clip in place I can check with my thumb for the clip, then slip my thumb forward to the on-off switch.For quick bright light, half pressing the tail cap switch activates momentary turbo mode. Pressing that switch fully to \u2018click\u2019 keeps turbo mode brightness on until another full press of the tail cap switch turns the light off. That mode generates instant heat and it gets hotter the longer that mode is on. Double-pressing the side switch also activates turbo mode.From light off, a long hold on the side switch activates Firefly mode. It\u2019s a very dim light, the dimmest of any of my flashlights, but could be useful in total dark situations or for maneuvering around light sleepers in your vicinity. Firefly mode is too dim to photograph.The light on the lawn may help differentiate the lighting modes. These are, in order, low, medium, high and turbo.Once the light is powered on by the side switch, a one second hold at a time moves through the various brightness modes.The light returns to whatever brightness mode you last used if you single press the side switch.I think it\u2019s commendable that the sharp self-defense bezel is removable. (Honest officer, those are cooling fins.)I have mixed feelings about these things, more from how they give a false sense of security. Though I admit it\u2019s better than your keys between your fingers. My defense bezel will probably stay boxed for the making of a slightly shorter flashlight and less chance of poking a hole in my pocket or fingers.I\u2019m a fan of side switches. The hand\u2019s natural grip with the arm relaxed at one\u2019s side can easily move the thumb to a flashlight side switch, whereas you need the arm flexed to use a tailcap switch. With the BSS V4 you can either grab the light in arm flexed fight position for the turbo mode if necessary, or use the side switch with your arm by your side.I fight darkness mostly (not in the Vader sense), so there are those occasions where maximum light is needed fast. One night last winter I heard a commotion outside beyond our back deck. It sounded like a person coming through leaves in our yard. I grabbed whatever flashlight I had on me at that time which also had a tailcap switch, got it up to full bright mode with my upraised arm, and two beady, reflective little eyes peered back at me from a tree branch 20 feet away. A possum, it was. My pulse returned to normal a bit later. I would have used and appreciated 2523 lumens from a VSS V4 at the time.An interesting lens filter is included that looks mirrored, and, as if it might be a green filter if you view it from its edge with the light off or on. But it\u2019s for producing red light. It screws on the end of the lens cap. It\u2019s a nice add-on but I\u2019m not sure how much I\u2019ll use it. As cool as it is to have the benefits of red light (easier on the eyes in full darkness) I\u2019d have to either leave the lens filter screwed on, or carry it around in a pocket for times I would use it. I\u2019m sure campers would easily find a place to store the filter to use when needed.Thrunite includes two O rings for replacement of the tailcap seal, two extra charge port covers and a spare tailcap button cover. That\u2019s a nice supply of the high wear items and probably sets users up for years of trouble free operation without having to make additional purchases.If you look at the Amazon listing for the BSS V4 you\u2019ll see a video of a guy repeatedly tossing the flashlight onto asphalt, submerging it, freezing it, cracking it out of the ice, etc. (His must have been complimentary too.)I\u2019m not going to try those stunts but assuming all BSS V4s are made like his was, it should be a durable deviceAfter some emailing with the company I am still a bit unclear on how the lumens and runtimes are expressed in the spec sheet.I asked: \u201cOn the specifications chart, what is meant by the values shown in the \u2018High\u2019 and Turbo\u2019 columns where minus values are shown after the first value? E.g. for High mode \u201c1426-634 lumens\u201d is indicated. Why the minus value?\u201dTHRUNITE answered: \u201cFor example High mode \u201c1426-634 lumens from the first 10 seconds when you turn on the light to 130 SECONS , the lumens 1426 will step down to 634 lumens, then it will stay on 634 to 150 minutes until it turned off, or battery drainded \u201cTo my request for clarification of the \u2018+\u2019 figures shown in run times they replied:\u201cWhen on one certain mode, the run time is the time it takes in dropping from 100% lumens to 10% lumens. It does not mean the time that the flashlight stays on 100% lumens.You can also check the standards of ANSI/NEMA FL1-2009.\u201dI\u2019d say the spec sheet needs revamping with clear explanatory notes.  * The generous supply of the rubber parts.  * The charging port cover does not flip open in the pocket or with normal use, but is not hard to open when necessary.  * The side button needs to feel more obvious and have a tactile difference from the charging port cover.  * The 3 pocket clip edges are upturned and could be uncomfortable if gripped directly.  * Make the spec sheet clear and understandable.The THRUNITE BSS V4 tactical flashlight is a very solid, well made and useful flashlight that should provide years of service.**Source:** The sample for this review was provided by Thrunite**Support The Gadgeteer** : _The Gadgeteer is supported by readers like you!

The contract eventually went to Musk's SpaceX, who then poached members of Blue Origin to work on its team.Blue Origin, saw \"at least\" 17 of its top staffers defect from the company, we wrote last month. One employee, a lead engineer, left to take a job at SpaceX, according to reporting by Insider. Another employee wound up at Firefly Aerospace.CNBC then followed up, noting that \"many other engineers and key leaders\" also left Blue Origin and that some of them were part of the team that tried to land the lunar contract.

Lewis and her iconic sock-puppet friend first appeared on TV in the mid-1950s on the classic kid\u2019s show Captain Kangaroo. From there, the pair and a handful of other puppets went on to become TV mainstays for decades.One of Brightlight Pictures\u2019 chairman Shawn Williamson\u2019s first jobs was working on TV shows with famed performer Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop. PBSBeginning in 1990 when he was age 25, Williamson, now 56, worked with Lewis and company on multiple shows for almost 10 years. After Lewis\u2019s death in 1998, her family sent Williamson the puppet that he says is one of the original eight Lamb Chops.The little lamb has always been a big reminder of a very formative time in his life, a time that kicked off what has become an A-list career that now is highlighted by Brightlight Pictures celebrating its 20th anniversary this month.Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\u201cIt was the first show that had me permitted to work in the United States. I remember driving to work in Beverly Hills feeling so excited working in Beverly Hills. As this kid growing up in North Van going, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m in Hollywood,\u2019 \u201d said Williamson. \u201cThe energy and enthusiasm I had then still hasn\u2019t faded. I still feel lucky every day and blessed to do what I do. That\u2019s what we try to convey to our clients \u2014 we love going to work. We love doing what we do for a living.\u201dThese days Brightlight Pictures is a leader in the $4-billion-plus B.C. TV/film industry. To date, it has produced 51 features and 35 series in B.C. and around the world. Currently Brightlight is working on the bold-type successes Firefly Lane from Netflix, ABC\u2019s The Good Doctor and Amazon\u2019s Upload.Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Katherine Heigl, left, and Sarah Chalke star in the Vancouver-shot TV show Firefly Lane.

Every time we use them, we know we are going to get the best in class crew and service,\u201d said Mike Posey, vice-president, Original Series Production Ucan at Netflix, when asked why his company keeps coming back to Brightlight. \u201cIn short, reliability. When you are able to tap into a trusted company like Brightlight it allows you to focus on what\u2019s most important \u2014 making the best content.\u201dAcademy-Award-winning producer Nicholas Chartier (The Hurt Locker and the Dallas Buyer\u2019s Club) has been doing business with Brightlight for 15 years.\u201cEverything we do in Vancouver we do with Brightlight,\u201d said Chartier in an email. \u201cThere are familiar faces you deal with so you know it must be working well because people stay there at that company for a long time. It helps us because we know they know what they are doing.\u201dStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.With the B.C. TV/film industry continuing to grow options for producers and production companies, for Tara Flynn, a drama series executive at Netflix, Brightlight is the bright spot on the Hollywood North landscape.\u201cThe ethos and culture that Shawn and his producers bring to the business is stellar,\u201d said Flynn via email. \u201cVancouver is a great place to film and the Brightlight team represents some of the amazing talent the region offers.\u201dWhile people will officially toast Brightlight Pictures\u2019 success at a Sept. 20 party, the actual birthday Williamson points to is Sept. 11, 2001. It was on that ominous date that Brightlight Pictures made the front page of the influential trade paper Variety.\u201cIt was somewhat surreal because it was 9/11,\u201d said Williamson.Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.The press was the result of his partner at the time, Stephen Hedges, having produced the film, The Last Wedding (Vancouver\u2019s Bruce Sweeney directed), which earned the honour of being selected to open the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) that year.\u201cIt provided a great platform to launch the company because really of how big TIFF is,\u201d said Williamson, who was with Shavick Entertainment before Brightlight.Thanks to a burgeoning indie film scene, the company had successes right out of the box and in 2005 it got the big nod from the big guys.\u201cI think White Noise was the first film that really put us on the map in that Hollywood knew who we were as a company and as producers,\u201d said Williamson about the Geoffrey Sax-directed psychological thriller starring Michael Keaton. \u201cThey went, \u2018OK, these guys can make films we can sell.\u2019 At the end of the day it is the business part of the film business and show business that we can\u2019t forget as Canadian filmmakers.Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to make art but it is another thing to make art that people watch, and that people want to buy and such,\u201d added Williamson. \u201cWhite Noise allowed us to make something that we owned, that we still own and that we are still able to make money from which is really, really nice.\u201dNow decades into this business, Williamson is introspective as well as grateful for early lessons learned and lessons he passes on to others who work with him.\u201cI started out at the Arts Club Theatre (1983-87). I was trained as a stage manager and so I didn\u2019t start in film and film wasn\u2019t really the thing back then in the early \u201980s here at least as a full industry,\u201d said Williamson. \u201cWe were trained as stage managers to support the actors, the script and the director. If those three elements of any creative endeavour, films, live or whatever, are strong you end up generally with a very solid piece of work that people want to watch. The reality as producers is our job is to support those three and then get out of the way and let them do what they do. That is what I try and instil in the up-and-coming producers that work with us and our production team.Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\u201cFor us it isn\u2019t about us or our ego or our name. It\u2019s about the filmmakers,\u201d added Williamson.Brightlight Pictures chairman Shawn Williamson and his team are getting ready to celebrate 20 successful years in the TV/film business. Currently, the Vancouver-based company has a handful of top TV projects on the go in B.C., including ABC\u2019s medical procedural drama The Good Doctor. Photo by Arlen Redekop /PNGDuring a recent phone call, Williamson\u2019s lawyer of 20 years, Arthur Evrensel, said he has seen Williamson become a \u201cvery dynamic leader,\u201d who has excelled in many aspects of the business.\u201cI think that is driven by his passion for the work. He is inspired by I think the people he works with. He is one of those people who genuinely loves doing what they do,\u201d said Evrensel, who represents many major studios and production companies. \u201cHe is always very idealistic and very creative in both the business and the production side. The studios are very, very buttoned down in terms of what they need and he is able to talk both their language and the language of production, and when you can jump over that chasm I think you become essential to that industry and he is definitely essential. He is one of two or three people in Western Canada that gets called on just about every show. He probably has the pick of the litter.\u201dAs for the next 20 years, well, hardly anyone ever retires from show business, but Williamson says he will slow down his workload in the next decade. In the meantime, he has some straightforward advice for those who have their eyes on a career like his:\u201cGo and find somebody who has access already, a producer, a production manager or somebody and talk to them about what it is really like. At the beginning of your career, when you\u2019re building it, it can be very taxing, but if you are willing to do that, work a lot and hard, then the world is your oyster.\u201d## Share this article in your social network  *   *   *   * ##  Share this Story: Vancouver company notches big milestone in competitive TV/film industryStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Vancouver Sun, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.  * There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Firefly's Alpha Rocket Detonates Shortly After LaunchRocket science is hard. So far, no commercial rocket launch company has ever successfully gotten to orbit on the first try. The first flight of Firefly's Alpha rocket prototype did not break that streak last week when it exploded two and a half minutes after takeoff from Vandenberg Space Force Base.The launch, which took place on September 3rd, was the first flight of the Alpha, which hit some milestones, although it did not \u201cmeet all of [their] missions objectives,\u201d according to a company statement.  The milestones it did meet include first stage ignition, liftoff, and hitting supersonic speeds.  And, of course, the company got plenty of data to analyze.Video of the Alpha Prototype Test Flight.  Credit - Firefly AerospaceSome of that data pointed to a first-stage engine shut down as the main cause of the failure. According to a statement from the company, one of the four Reaver engines shut down 15 seconds into the flight. The engine itself didn\u2019t explode, just shut off, with the main propellant valves simply closing and terminating the rocket\u2019s fuel. That resulted in a much slower climb rate than expected, with the rocket reaching Mach 1 over a minute later than planned.It also resulted in a control problem once the vehicle did reach supersonic speeds at 2 minutes 20 seconds after takeoff. Ten seconds later, the rocket exploded over the Pacific Ocean after it appeared to tumble briefly.  There were no injuries, though some eyewitnesses saw debris falling on Orcutt, California, located just to the north of the rocket\u2019s launch pad. This is actually the second time in a few weeks that an engine shutdown caused a failed launch, with Astra, another launch company, failing to get its own payload into orbit at the end of August.Video of the failed Astra launch that shows the rocket failing after rising to about 50km off the ground. Launch starts at around 1:33:00 into the video.  Credit - NASASpaceflight.comThat debris path is a rarity at Vandenberg. The Firefly team decided to take a wider flight corridor to orbit by flying to the west rather than to the south as is traditional for rockets launching from the base.  The alternative path required a trade-off, though - the rocket didn\u2019t have as much payload capacity as it would have if it had taken off on the usual southern flight path.Given that this was the first \u201cflight test,\u201d the rocket only carried 92 kilograms of material, both technical and non-technical. The non-technical payloads included things like pictures from the engineers who worked on the prototype. The technical payloads launched as part of the company\u2019s Dedicated Research and Educational Accelerator Missions (DREAM) mainly consisted of small technology demonstration Cubesats, such as one from Purdue that would test a deorbiting drag sail and an even smaller form factor satellites from the LibreSpace Foundation known as a PocketQube. The Greek non-profit also hoped to test its PicoBus technology to dispense up to 8 PocketQubes at once.Firefly video discussing the DREAM payload.  Credit - Firefly AerospaceIt seems like the company\u2019s explanation for what went wrong is plausible. Now its engineers will have the challenge of figure out how to fix it.  If Firefly is anything like its competitors in the commercial space launch industry, there should be a new, improved Alpha flight test in no time flat.SpaceNews - Firefly Alpha explodes during first launch  EveryDay Astronaut - FLTA001 DREAM | Alpha  SpaceNews - Firefly Alpha failure blamed on premature engine shutdown  Space.com - Firefly Aerospace's first Alpha rocket explodes during launch debut after major anomalyFirefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket prototype explodes on its first launch.

Firefly Aerospace's first launch of its Alpha rocket ended in failure when the rocket exploded 2.5 minutes after liftoff last Thursday, September 2. The video can be seen here. Two days after the launch, Firefly said the rocket failed when one of its first-stage engines shut down seconds after liftoff, SpaceNews reports. One of the four Reaver engines in the rocket's first stage, designated engine 2, shut down 15 seconds into the flight._No more fuel to burn_ ... \"It was an uneventful shutdown\u2014the engine didn't fail\u2014the propellant main valves on the engine simply closed and thrust terminated from engine 2,\" the company stated. The rocket continued to ascend using the remaining three engines\u2014but with reduced thrust. That would explain the underperformance apparent in the flight: according to the company's press kit, the vehicle was supposed to reach Mach 1 67 seconds into the flight, but launch controllers did not report that the vehicle was supersonic until 2 minutes 20 seconds after liftoff.

Learn more# Firefly Aerospace traces rocket launch failure to premature engine shutdownBy  Mike Wall  07 September 2021The main propellant valves for one of Alpha's four first-stage engines closed.Firefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket lifts off on its debut launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Sept. 2, 2021. The rocket failed about 2 minutes, 30 seconds into the flight.  (Image credit: Everyday Astronaut/Firefly Aerospace)_Firefly Aerospace's_ debut launch last week failed because of a premature engine shutdown, company representatives have determined.Texas-based Firefly conducted its first-ever orbital test flight on Thursday (Sept. 2), sending its 95-foot-tall (29 meters) Alpha rocket skyward from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. About 2.5 minutes after liftoff, the two-stage launcher began to tumble, and shortly thereafter it _exploded in a dramatic fireball_.Firefly quickly initiated an anomaly investigation, which has made substantial progress already. On Sunday (Sept. 5), the company announced the proximate cause of the failure: One of Alpha's four first-stage Reaver engines shut down unexpectedly about 15 seconds after liftoff. **Video:** _Watch Firefly Aerospace use a rocket engine to light birthday candles_\"The vehicle continued to climb and maintain control for a total of about 145 seconds, whereas nominal first-stage burn duration is about 165 seconds. However, due to missing the thrust of 1 of 4 engines, the climb rate was slow, and the vehicle was challenged to maintain control without the thrust vectoring of engine 2,\" Alpha representatives _wrote in a Twitter thread_ on Sunday.\" _Alpha_ was able to compensate at subsonic speeds, but as it moved through transonic and into supersonic flight, where control is most challenging, the three-engine thrust vector control was insufficient and the vehicle tumbled out of control. The range terminated the flight using the explosive Flight Termination System (FTS). The rocket did not explode on its own,\" they added.Engine 2 shut down because its main propellant valves closed, Firefly added in the Twitter thread. The company is still working to understand what caused the valves to close, and to determine if anything else anomalous happened during Thursday's flight.\"We will report [the] root cause of the anomaly at the end of the investigation. In collaboration with the FAA and our partners at Space Launch Delta 30, we'll return to conduct Alpha Flight 2 as soon as possible,\" Firefly wrote in the Twitter thread, referring to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the Vandenberg-based Space Force unit that oversees launches from the West Coast.  Firefly Aerospace's first Alpha rocket suffers an  anomaly during its first launch that led to the loss of the vehicle 2 minutes, 30 seconds after liftoff from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California on Sept. 2, 2021. (Image credit: Everyday Astronaut/Firefly Aerospace)Alpha is an expendable rocket designed to deliver up to 2,200 pounds (1,000 kg) to low Earth orbit on each $15 million mission, according to _Firefly's specifications page_. On Thursday, the rocket took off with a 203-pound (92 kg) payload called DREAM (\"Dedicated Research and Education Accelerator Mission\"), which consisted of memorabilia contributed by schools and other institutions, as well as a  number of tiny satellites.Alpha also carried components of the space tug that Firefly is working on, called the Space Utility Vehicle, to give them an in-space test, _according to SpaceNews_. _Mike Wall is the author of \"_ _ _Out There__ _\" (Grand Central Publishing, 2018; illustrated by Karl Tate), a book about the search for alien life.

A failed engine appeared to have been the cause.Over the weekend, a second rocket start-up -- this time from Firefly Aerospace -- suffered a similar failure when one of its engines prematurely shut down.Granted, Firefly is not Astra, and the failure of both companies to reach orbit, even in launches that happened in quick succession, was not linked. Nevertheless, the proximity in time of the two failures may have reminded investors in these (still unprofitable) space companies that space is hard, and success isn't guaranteed.Investors should keep in mind, moreover, that even once the companies succeed in reaching orbit -- and I believe they will, in time -- their success at earning profits in an increasingly crowded field such as space launch has even less guarantee of success.This article represents the opinion of the writer, who may disagree with the \u201cofficial\u201d recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service.

(credit: J. Foust)  # Small launch vehicles face their biggest testTuesday, September 7, 2021Astrobiology has a concept known as the \"Great Filter.\" It is an attempt to explain why, despite the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy, there is currently no evidence of intelligent life beyond Earth. It argues that, somewhere in the progression of factors laid out in the Drake Equation six decades ago from the number of stars to the number of intelligent civilizations, there is a factor that greatly diminishes the prospects of intelligent life to exist.That Great Filter has shifted to the right, as both ground-based telescopes and spacecraft discover a growing number of exoplanets, including those with the right sizes and orbits to be potentially habitable. Perhaps the challenge is for life to form on those worlds, or for that life to develop into more complex forms. Or, perhaps most ominously, it is that intelligent, technological civilizations have short lifetimes--suggesting that humanity itself still has not made it through the Great Filter.Raising funding for launch startups is easier than ever. The obstacle launch startups now face is converting that funding into launch vehicles that can reach orbit.  The launch industry has its own Great Filter. Hundreds of ventures have appeared over the last several decades, proposing to develop new launch vehicles that promise more frequent and more affordable access to space. Yet very few companies have successfully developed and operated commercial launchers, such as Orbital Sciences Corporation with the Pegasus three decades ago, SpaceX with the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 a little more than a decade ago, and Rocket Lab and Virgin Orbit with their small launchers in the last few years.For many years, the Great Filter of the launch industry appeared to be funding: without government support it was very difficult for startups to raise the large sums needed to develop a new rocket. The reusable launch vehicle startups of the latter half of the 1990s never got very far because of a lack of funding. A decade later, Rocketplane Kistler--itself a rebirth of Kistler Aerospace, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the early 2000s--ran out of money in the 2008 financial crisis, despite a NASA commercial cargo award. Two years ago, small launch vehicle developer Vector closed its doors and liquidated its assets before its first orbital launch attempt.But, like in astrobiology, the Great Filter is moving to the right. Raising funding for launch startups is easier than ever, and not just seed rounds to get companies started. Relativity Space, for example, has raised more than $1 billion in two rounds in the last year, even though it has yet to attempt its first orbital launch. Special-purpose acquisition corporations, or SPACs, have become a popular means for companies to go public and raise hundreds of millions of dollars, even if those companies have yet to generate any revenue.The obstacle launch startups now face is converting that funding into launch vehicles that can reach orbit. Two ventures that suffered launch failures less than a week apart demonstrate that technical challenge may be a bigger factor sorting out the dozens of current startups from the handful likely to be successful.Astra's Rocket 3.3 tips and begins to drift sideways seconds after liftoff August 28. (credit: Astra/NASASpaceFlight.com)  Twice before, Astra tried to reach orbit and failed. In September 2020, a guidance system issue caused its Rocket 3.1 vehicle to drift off course shortly after liftoff from Kodiak Island, Alaska, triggering an engine shutdown. The vehicle fell back to Earth and exploded. Three months later, the company tried again with Rocket 3.2, which nearly reached orbit. The rocket's upper-stage engine shut down seconds early when it ran out of fuel, causing it to fall just short of orbital velocity.The company was confident that it could fix that problem with minor tweaks and declared it had demonstrated \"orbital launch capability\" despite not placing anything in orbit. \"An identically performing launch from Cape Canaveral, for example, would have reached orbit at our target orbital velocity and target altitude,\" Chris Kemp, CEO and co-founder of Astra, said in an earnings call last month. \"Launching to polar orbits, like from Kodiak, Alaska, requires more performance than low-inclination orbits.\"\"Making any changes to a complex system like a rocket always involves risk,\" Kemp said. \"We appreciate this, but also believe that maximizing our learning requires us to make advances and take appropriate technical risks.\"  That earnings call was another sign of a changing company. Astra, which emerged from stealth mode in early 2020, announced a year later it was going public by merging with a SPAC called Holicity. The merger closed five months later, turning Astra into a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq and raising about $500 million to fund its growth plans, which include more powerful versions of its launch vehicles and a line of satellites optimized to launch on them.Astra, now well-capitalized, still had to demonstrate it could place payloads in orbit. Its next launch was scheduled for August 27, carrying a test payload for the US Space Force. The payload itself would not separate from the upper stage but instead collect data on the launch environment to prepare for a second Space Force launch, then expected for later in the year under a deal announced in early August.Astra did more than correct the fuel issue on the upper stage. The Rocket 3.3 vehicle that would launch that mission featured stretched propellant tanks in the first stage, reducing the mass of the upper stage, and consolidating more than a dozen unspecified components on the upper stage into a single unit.\"Making any changes to a complex system like a rocket always involves risk,\" Kemp said in the earnings call. \"We appreciate this, but also believe that maximizing our learning requires us to make advances and take appropriate technical risks.\"The first launch attempt of that rocket--designated LV0006 by Astra, a serial number whose leading zeroes quietly expressed its confidence in producing thousands of rockets to meet its goals of near-daily launches later this decade--was scrubbed August 27. The countdown went to zero and the engines ignited, only to immediately shut down. Astra later said engine thrust wasn't ramping up as fast as expected at ignition, triggering the shutdown.The next day the company tried again. At 6:35 pm EDT, the countdown hit zero, the engines ignited, and the rocket left the pad.And then, almost immediately after leaving the pad, the launch went sideways--literally. The rocket tipped to one side, as if it was about the fall over and explode. Instead, it righted itself and started drifting to one side, hovering just off the ground, a maneuver some watching the live webcast--a first for Astra, which did not broadcast previous launches--called a \"power slide\" or \"driftoff.\" Only after about 15 to 20 seconds did the rocket stop going sideways and start to ascend.By then, of course, the mission was doomed. The rocket continued to climb until about two and a half minutes after liftoff, when the range triggered a shutdown of the rocket's first-stage engines because it was outside its licensed trajectory. After reaching a peak altitude of 50 kilometers, it fell into the ocean.In a brief call with reporters an hour and a half after liftoff, Kemp said one of the five engines in the first stage shut down less than a second after liftoff, for reasons not yet known. \"The guidance system was able to maintain control and the rocket began flying horizontally for a few seconds until we burned off enough propellants to begin resuming with our liftoff,\" he said.The issue, he added, was not linked to the aborted liftoff a day earlier. There was also speculation the rocket may have hit the launch mount as it lifted off, causing it to tip and go sideways, but Kemp said that if it did, it happened after the engine failure.The company said it will work with the FAA, which licensed the launch, to investigate the failure and incorporate any changes into its next vehicle, LV0007. \"We collected a tremendous amount of data from the flight, and we have Launch Vehicle 7 at the stage of production where we'll be able to incorporate everything we learned before sending it up to Kodiak and launching again,\" Kemp said.The Alpha launch vehicle on the pad at Vandenberg Space Force Base the day before launch. (credit: J. Foust)  ### Firefly's Alpha testFive days later, it was Firefly Aerospace's turn as it performed the inaugural launch of its Alpha rocket. In 2016, Firefly appeared to be the victim of the financial problems that had doomed other launch startups, running out of money and filing for bankruptcy. Ukrainian entrepreneur Max Polyakov bought the company's assets and reconstituted the company, allowing it to continue work on Alpha. Firefly raised $75 million in May and has been working on a new, larger round.\"Alpha is a pretty straightforward rocket design, so whatever problem we might have, we think it is something that can be addressed relatively quickly,\" Markusic said before the rocket's first launch.  After years of development and delays--most recently waiting for a long-overdue delivery of a component of the rocket's flight termination system from an unnamed vendor--Alpha was ready for launch. In an interview before the mission, Firefly CEO Tom Markusic was confident the vehicle was ready. \"This vehicle has definitely been put through its paces,\" he said, citing nearly 20 hotfire tests of its engines. \"We're ready to go.\"In the same interview, though, he acknowledged that first launches of new vehicle often fail. \"It's not unusual to have an anomaly on the first flight and then, just depending on the severity of the anomaly, it could be several weeks to several months\" to correct the problem, he said. \"Alpha is a pretty straightforward rocket design, so whatever problem we might have, we think it is something that can be addressed relatively quickly.\"A day before the flight, he and other company executives emphasized that point. \"It's a test flight,\" said Lauren Lyons, a former SpaceX and Blue Origin engineer who joined Firefly in August as its chief operating officer. \"Our really big goal is to get Alpha to space. If we can get to orbit, even better. If we can open up that fairing and deploy those satellites, even better. Our goals are to collect as much data as we possibly can and take Alpha as far as it can go.\"Alpha is designed to place up to a metric ton into low Earth orbit, but on this mission, called Dedicated Research and Educational Accelerator Mission (DREAM), it was carrying less than 100 kilograms: a collection of cubesats, technology demonstrators, and what the company called \"non-technical\" payloads, which ranged from photos to memorabilia.Alpha would also fly an unusual trajectory, heading west and not south from the former Delta II launch pad at Vandenberg Space Force Base. If the payloads made it to orbit, they would go into a retrograde orbit at a relatively low altitude of 300 kilometers.That move, Markusic said, made range safety easier. \"If we were flying due south, we'd have a very tight corridor we'd have to go down though,\" he said the day before the launch. \"Here, we have a very wide corridor so that, if the vehicle's not tracking quite right, it gives us an opportunity to get back on track without having to terminate the mission.\"Firefly had a four-hour launch window at Vandenberg on September 2 that opened at 6 pm local (9 pm EDT). An initial launch attempt was halted in the final seconds of the countdown for unspecified issues, but controllers recycled the count and tried again 59 minutes later. This time, the count reached zero, the engines ignited, and Alpha took off from the pad.It looked at first like the launch was going to plan. The vehicle climbed and appeared to be stable. The only indication of a problem was when a controller said more than 90 seconds after liftoff that the vehicle was not yet supersonic. According to a mission timeline released by the company, Alpha was supposed to hit Mach 1 67 second after liftoff, and maximum dynamic pressure, or Max Q, nine second after that. Something was causing the vehicle to underperform.Finally, 2 minutes and 20 seconds after liftoff, controllers announced the vehicle was now supersonic. Seconds later, though, it started to tumble. Video showed that, in the first gyrations, the rocket's payload fairing was ripped off. The rocket, though, remained intact as it tumbled for about ten seconds. Then, an explosion destroyed the vehicle, which Firefly said was the result of the range triggering the rocket's flight termination system.Firefly released Sunday a video of the launch along with an initial explanation of what happened. One of the four Reaver engines in the first stage of the rocket shut down 15 seconds after liftoff. \"It was an uneventful shutdown--the engine didn't fail--the propellant main valves on the engine simply closed and thrust terminated from engine 2,\" the company stated, but didn't explain why the valves closed.\"Although the vehicle did not make it to orbit, the day marked a major advancement for the Firefly team, as we demonstrated that we 'arrived' as a company capable of building and launching rockets,\" it stated.  With three engines, the rocket could continue to ascend, but more slowly, which would explain why the announcement that the vehicle was supersonic came a minute late. Going transonic was too much for the vehicle's to take. At that point, Firefly stated, \"thrust vector control was insufficient and the vehicle tumbled out of control.\" The range then activated the flight termination system to destroy the rocket.\"Firefly has commenced a thorough anomaly investigation to gain understanding of why engine 2 shutdown early, and uncover any other relevant unexpected events during flight,\" the company said, working with the FAA and Space Launch Delta 30, which operates the range at Vandenberg.How long the investigation and subsequent corrective actions will take remains to be seen. Markusic said before the flight that, had the first launch gone well, the company would be ready for a second launch, this time with a commercial payload, as soon as December.In its Sunday announcement, the company emphasized the launch, while a failure, was a step forward. \"Although the vehicle did not make it to orbit, the day marked a major advancement for the Firefly team, as we demonstrated that we 'arrived' as a company capable of building and launching rockets,\" it stated. \"We also acquired a wealth of flight data that will greatly enhance the likelihood of Alpha achieving orbit during its second flight. In short, we had a very successful first flight.\"Real success, though, will come when Astra, Firefly, and other small launch vehicle developers demonstrate they can place payloads into orbit. At that point they will have passed one filter, from funding to launching. As more companies follow, though, we may find the industry's Great Filter is further to the right: not just raising money or building rockets, but instead developing a sustainable business. That may be the biggest challenge of all.Jeff Foust (jeff@thespacereview.com) is the editor and publisher of The Space Review, and a senior staff writer with SpaceNews.

In the showcase, titles can be navigated through linked content pages, and search functionality can surface related content on key terms, topics, and authors.At the end of this article, we'll embed an illustrative video about the project and how to access its collections and read the books, thanks to Exact Editions' creation of the video as an exclusive to _Publishing Perspectives_.A partial listing of publishers contributing books to the showcase includes:  * Firefly PressThe IPA, of course, has worked with the United Nations to create the SDG Publishers Compact, which was introduced at Frankfurter Buchmesse and in July announced that it had attracted more than 100 signatories to its commitment of 10 points of support for the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)\u2014many of which are intimately related to the dynamics of the fast-rising debate around the climate crisis.The IPA also has partnered with the UN on its SDG Book Club, which creates a special syllabus of books for children, each edition expressly matching one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.And Save the Children has created a series of articles and talking points around the climate crisis. As one of the most recent write-ups from the series says, \"Children have contributed the least to the climate crisis but will pay the highest price.\"The United Kingdom's Exact Editions in London, as _Publishing Perspectives_ readers know, is a digital publisher, frequently announcing its latest digitization of a series or collection of content.In March, for example, when we announced the news that _Banipal Magazine of Modern Arab Literature_ would begin publishing _La Revista Banipal de literatura \u00e1rabe moderna_, the Spanish-language counterpart to Banipal, we learned that Exact Editions was the company that would create and distribute the new edition. Exact Editions had also created a digitized archive of close to 70 issues of the magazine, dating back to 1998.Some of the contributions of books publishers are making to the COP26 showcase of climate-related books. Image: Exact Editions##### Adam Hodgkin: 'Such an Important Cause'In a prepared comment from Adam Hodgkin, the co-founding chair of Exact Editions, we read, \"The ability to effortlessly stream large archives and collections online means the platform is the ideal tool for publishers to project content in support of the COP26 conference.\"We're proud to champion such an important cause and proud that the wide range of material makes the showcase compelling to people of any age and stage.\"Part of the functionality Hodgkin refers to is Exact Editions' branded \"Reading Room\" provision, which allows publishers to issue streaming, time-limited access to digital editions of their content.Michiel Kolman, chair of the IPA Inclusive Publishing and Literacy Committee, is quoted, saying, \u201cResearch has shown that reading has the power to deepen our understanding of key issues.\"In terms of climate change, both fiction and nonfiction genres help to inform, inspire and ultimately shape a sustainable culture.\"Publishers are also increasingly taking steps to reduce their own environmental footprints,\" he says, pointing out the apt parallel of form and function in the project: \"This purely digital showcase is indicative of a move to more sustainable initiatives.\"And Emma Wagner, Save the Children's head of education policy and advocacy, speaks for the availability of young readers' content in the collections.\"The showcase,\" she says, \"is a wonderful resource. \"The role of children in tackling the climate crisis is crucial and the educational books included in the showcase enable them to simply understand complex issues and tackle them positively as they grow up.\"We call for more accessible and multilingual resources for children of all ages on climate change be made available worldwide.\"Exact Editions maintains a blog section on its site, and you can learn more about the new showcase there, and in the video below.The plan for the new showcase of books on and related to the climate crisis is that it will run not only during COP26 and the Italian Pre-COP meeting, but that it will also be used parallel to other key events and alongside displays of other resources.The timing of the project's appearance\u2014and the coming conferences\u2014could hardly seem more apt, as heat waves, wildfires, ferocious storms, and fast-rising, deadly floodwaters this summer have prompted people in many parts of the world to focus more on the crisis than in the past. At the very least, the element of the COP26 goals that refers to \"building defenses, warning systems, and resilient infrastructure\" is clearly becoming urgent in the near-term, with the longer-range outlooks of \"protecting and restoring ecosystems\" to follow quickly.Nick Perry at the Associated Press on Monday (September 6) wrote about how \"The southern winter that just ended in New Zealand was the warmest ever recorded, and scientists say that climate change is driving temperatures ever higher.\"The Gulf of Mexico's waters last week were so high last week as Hurricane Ida made landfall that one meteorologist described the seawater as \"not a bathtub but a Jacuzzi.\" Matt McGrath at BBC News wrote, \"A new study shows that increases in extreme winter weather in parts of the United States are linked to accelerated warming of the Arctic. The scientists found that heating in the region ultimately disturbed the circular pattern of winds known as the polar vortex.\"In Athens, AP's Derek Gatopoulos writes, \"Greece\u2019s center-right government has created a new ministry to address the impact of climate change and named former European Union commissioner Christos Stylianides as minister. \"Stylianides, 63, who served as commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management between 2014 and 2019, was appointed in the wake of wildfires that burned more than 1,000 square kilometers (385 square miles) of forest on the island of Evia and in southern Greece.\"And even as more than 45 people died in devastating flash-flooding in New York City, Shane Hickey at _The Guardian_ is writing of how the flooding that struck England near the end of July \"was mirrored in areas across London and in parts of Suffolk and the Isle of Wight, while in Europe record-breaking rainfall this summer has led to catastrophic destruction. This has been attributed to the climate crisis and scientists have warned of more to come as temperatures rise.\"Last week, on Thursday (September 2), heavy rains contributed to flash-flooding in Spain (Joan Mateu, AP), and more than 180 people died in the German floods of July 14 and 15 (AP).As Rebecca Falconer reported Monday (September 6) for Axios, editors of more than 230 medical journals warned on Sunday, \"Ahead of this November's UN general assembly and the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow: 'The greatest threat to global public health is the continued failure of world leaders to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5C and to restore nature.'\"Below is the illustrative video created for _Publishing Perspectives_ by Exact Editions.Video: Exact Editions_More on climate change and crisis response ishere, more on COP26 is here, more on Exact Editions is here, and more on the International Publishers Association is here. __Publishing Perspectives is the world media partner of the International Publishers Association.__More from us on the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on international book publishing ishere._ __Facebook __Twitter __Google+Porter Anderson has been named International Trade Press Journalist of the Year in London Book Fair's 2019 International Excellence Awards.

Reduction in gene expression by RNAi is the result of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecule binding to an ARGONAUTE (AGO) protein and directing the effector complex to a homologous region of a target gene\u2019s mRNA. siRNAs properties that govern RNA-AGO association have been studied in detail. The siRNA 5\u2019 nucleotide (nt) identity has been demonstrated in plants to be an important property responsible for directing association of endogenous small RNAs with different AGO effector proteins. However, it has not been investigated whether the 5\u2019 nt identity is an efficacious determinant for topically-applied chemically synthesized siRNAs. In this study, we employed a sandpaper abrasion method to study the silencing efficacies of topically-applied 21 base-pair siRNA duplexes. The _MAGNESIUMCHELATASE_ and _GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN_ genes were selected as endogenous and transgenic gene targets, respectively, to assess the molecular and phenotypic effects of gene silencing. Collections of siRNA variants with different 5\u2019 nt identities and different pairing states between the 5\u2019 antisense nt and its match in the sense strand of the siRNA duplex were tested for their silencing efficacy. Our results suggest a flexibility in the 5\u2019 nt requirement for topically applied siRNA duplexes _in planta_ and highlight the similarity of 5\u2019 thermodynamic rules governing topical siRNA efficacy across plants and animals.**Citation:** Yang P, Havecker E, Bauer M, Diehl C, Hendrix B, Hoffer P, et al.

Key features of the RNAi mechanism include the production and presence of small interfering RNA molecules (siRNAs) as part of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to suppress target RNA expression in a sequence specific manner [3, 4]. The siRNA duplexes are often produced by the endo-nucleolytic cleavage of longer double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules by the proteins Dicer and Drosha (animals) or Dicer-Like (DCL; plants) [5]. siRNA duplexes are generally 20\u201325 nt in length, have 2nt 3\u2019 overhangs and are bounded by 5\u2019-phospate and 3\u2019 hydroxyl moieties and additionally have 2\u2019-O-methylation at their 3\u2019 ends [6, 7]. AGO proteins and the associated machinery are responsible for selectively sorting these siRNA duplexes and retaining one strand of the siRNA duplex. This retained strand is responsible for guiding the RISC complex to a target mRNA using sRNA sequencespecificity and then mediates gene suppression [2, 8, 9].In plant biotechnology, RNAi has been utilized to improve crop quality or provide protection by establishing stable transgenics expressing antisense strand or long dsRNA or by applying topically dsRNA as a biopesticide [10\u201312]. Topical application of long dsRNAs has been achieved by infiltration of agrobacterium, delivered as crude bacteria extracts, and using carrier peptides [10\u201312]. Following the biolistic delivery of siRNAs with gene silencing [13], multiple approaches to successfully topically deliver the shorter siRNAs were developed, _e_. _g_., physical force, biological stress, lipid-based reagents, carbon dots and clay nanosheet technologies [2, 14\u201318].Key steps in achieving siRNA efficacy are the association of an siRNA duplex with AGO effector protein followed by retention of one strand of the siRNA duplex to form a functional RISC complex [5, 9, 19, 20]. The retained siRNA strand is responsible for sequence-specific targeting of the mRNA and can be referred to as the guide strand or the antisense strand (AS) of the duplex. For consistency and clarity, we will refer to the targeting siRNA strand as the (AS) strand in this paper.Multiple factors influencing AGO strand selection and sorting include the siRNA duplex structure and the 5\u2019 nucleotide identity of the AS strand [21\u201327]. In Drosophila, the duplex structure is a major determinant for miRNAs and siRNAs sorting into Ago1 and Ago2, respectively [24, 28]. In Arabidopsis, the 5\u2019 nucleotide of the AS strand plays a key role in sorting siRNA into specific AGOs [25, 27, 29]. AtAGO1, AtAGO2, AtAGO4 and AtAGO5 have verified 5\u2032\u2010nucleotide biases. Arabidopsis AGO1 preferentially binds miRNAs with a 5\u2019 uracil (U), AGO2 and AGO4 favor siRNAs with a 5\u2019 adenosine (A), AGO5 has a bias toward siRNAs with a 5\u2019 cytosine (C), whereas AGO4 primarily associates with heterochromatic-siRNAs bearing a 5\u2019 A [25, 27, 29, 30]. Interestingly, in the reports documenting AGO 5\u2019nucleotide biases, no AGO preferentially bound siRNAs with a 5\u2019 AS guanosine (G). Introduction of an antisense 5\u2019G perfectly paired with the sense strand of the duplex was shown to disable the siRNA\u2019s silencingsiRNA strand selection and retention by an AGO can be mediated by the differential thermodynamic stability between the siRNA duplex ends: the duplex strand with the relatively less stably paired 5\u2019 end will be preferentially selected for AGO retention as matter of loading geometry [31, 32]. The thermodynamic properties of siRNA duplexes have been studied extensively and can be calculated as the differential free energy between two ends of the duplex and is represented by \u0394\u0394G scores. Modification of \u0394\u0394G scores in siRNA duplexes has been shown to affect siRNA efficacy. In animal systems, the introduction of a mismatch between the 5\u2019 terminal AS nucleotide and its normally paired nucleotide on the sense strand rendered an siRNA efficacious because it promoted retention of a targeting AS strand of the duplex within the AGO effector complex [32\u201335]. Mismatched terminal nucleotide modifications have not been tested directly in plant-based RNA silencing systems.To understand the effect of the 5\u2019 AS nucleotide identity on gene silencing in plants, we employed a sandpaper abrasion method to topically deliver siRNA duplexes onto _N_. _benthamiana_ leaves. The siRNA duplexes were designed to induce silencing of either an endogenous gene _MAGNESIUM CHELATASE SUBUNIT H_ ( _CHLH_ ) or the transgene _GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN_ ( _GFP_ ) [36]. This topical system allowed us to study the effect of the 5\u2019 AS nucleotide identity in RNA silencing. Our observations suggested that the thermodynamic asymmetry without specific regard to the 5\u2019 AS nucleotide identity plays an important role in the RNAi activity of topically applied siRNAs in plants.All siRNA duplexes (Table 1) for topical applications and DNA oligos for Taqman assays (S1 Table) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa, USA). Anti-GFP antibodies (catalog # 632592) were sourced from Takara Bio USA Inc. _N_. _benthamiana_ 16C- GFP line was described in Ruiz _et al_. [37]. The CHLH and the GFP sequences can be found in the _N_. _benthamiana_ genome (https://solgenomics.net/organism/Nicotiana_benthamiana/genome) as Niben101Scf04388g00011.1 (or in the transcriptome collection (http://sefapps02.qut.edu.au/) as Nbv6.1trP75862) and in GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) as U87974.1, respectively.Table 1.  Summary of all the siRNA sequences with their locations and the targeted genes, with the calculated \u0394\u0394G.siRNA are written as 5\u2019 ->3\u2019 sense strand: 5\u2019->3\u2019 antisense strand. The bold and underlined letters denote non-native nucleotides. Pos, Position on the cDNA.The siRNAs to silence the target sequences ( _GFP_ or _CHL-H_ ) were selected with the following criteria (\u0394\u0394G< = 0, Reynolds score > = 5, GC% as 40\u201360%, minimum free energy closes to 0) for 19mers [38\u201341], and extended with the native sequence as the 21 nt sRNAs with the 2nt 3\u2019 overhangs. Reynolds score [40] is an algorithm incorporating 8 characteristics associated with siRNA functionality, including low G/C content, a bias towards low internal stability at the sense strand 3\u2019-terminus, lack of inverted repeat, and sense strand base preferences (positions 3, 10, 13 and 19).The terminal stability (\u0394G, kcal. mole-1) of the siRNA duplex was calculated using mfold by summing the nearest-neighbor contributions for the first five nucleotides (four nearest-neighbor energies) at the 5\u2019 end plus the free ssRNA overhangs, using the weblink (http://www.unafold.org/Dinamelt/applications/two-state-melting-folding.php) for the calculation [42]. Differential end stability (\u0394\u0394G, kcal\u00b7mol\u22121) was calculated as the difference in thermodynamic stabilities at each end.### Growth conditions and sandpaper RNA application treatmentBoth _N_. _benthamiana_ wild type and 16C-GFP transgenic plants were established in 4-inch pots and grown for two weeks in a controlled environment growth chamber (263 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1 of light intensity, set at 14 hours of light at 23 \u00b1 1\u00b0C and 10 h dark at 18 \u00b1 1\u00b0C). The lyophilized siRNA powder from IDT was resuspended in H2O at a desired concentration. 10\u201320 \u03bcl of dsRNA was applied to the third and/or fourth _N_. _benthamiana_ leaf. After application, the solution was gently spread on the top of the leaf using a pipette tip. P600 sandpaper was taped around a small cylinder, and was rolled over the top of the leaf, causing abrasion. The application leaves were allowed to dry, and plants were grown for an additional four days in the controlled environment growth chamber prior to being photographed under white light (for _CHLH_ siRNA treatment) or with UV light (for _GFP_ siRNA treatments). Six plants were included for each treatment. Tissue from the application regions was harvested forTaqman assay or western blots using a 4mm disposable biopsy punch (Sklar Instruments, West Chester, PA), was frozen immediately on dry ice and was stored for analysis.## GFP protein quantification by western blotTo determine GFP expression in leaves treated with siRNA, two 4 mm leaf discs were placed in FastPrep Lysing Matrix D tubes (Fisher Scientific) with 150 \u03bcl extraction buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7. 5, 5 mM MgCl2, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 0. 1% NP-40, 1X cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (catalog # 04693159001, Roche) and subjected to shaking for 20 seconds at 4 m/s. Fast prep tubes were then centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 10 min and equal amounts of extract was diluted with Novex NuPAGE LDS 2X Sample Buffer (supplemented with 10% B-mercaptoethanol) to a 1X final concentration. Proteins were denatured at 95\u00b0C for 10 min before loading onto a 7.5% BioRad TGX gel. After the gel was run, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a turbo blotter (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% blotto in TBST (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and anti-GFP antibody (catalog # 632593, Takara Bio USA Inc) was incubated for 1 hr at 1:2000 in 5% blotto. The membrane was then washed 3 times (5 min each) inTBST and then incubated for 1hr in 1:15000 goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The membrane was then washed 4 times (10 min each) in TBST and exposed in Pierce Super Signal Femto (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 min. An automatic exposure was done on a BioRad imager. Ponceau staining was completed for 2 min in 1X Ponceau-S and imaged with the BioRad imager on the colorimetric setting.For each sample, three 4 mm frozen leaf discs were ground with ball bearings and extracted using Direct-zol\u2122-96 RNA (Zymo Research; Irvine, CA). Total RNA was eluted in DNAse/RNAse free water, and used directly for cDNA synthesis. In the high throughput laboratory, the set amount of leaf samples routinely have RNA yields within the similar range, and therefore, only a few wells were spot-checked to ensure the concentration was less than 200 ng/ul to be below the saturating level of reverse transcription kit, Oligo dT cDNA was generated with High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA) per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Singleplex qPCR was performed with a 4-fold dilution of cDNA using either Quanta Bio (Beverly, MA) PerfeCTa Fast Mix II for probe based assays (EF1a and UKN1) or PerfeCTa SYBR green Supermix (CHLH and GFP) and run on BioRad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Hercules,CA). For quantification, EF1a and UKN1 was used as internalnormalizer genes. The primers and probes designed for _EF1a_ , _UKN1_ , _GFP_ and _CHLH_ can be found in S1 Table. Relative Quantity (RQ) was calculated by 2^-(GOI Ct\u2013GeoMean Internal Normalizer Ct). Standard Relative Quantity was then calculated to rescale values onto a scale of 100 by dividing the RQ by the mean of the baseline treatment (sandpaper only without any siRNA). Statistical analysis was performed and resulting LS means and error bars were plotted as a bar chart.Plant leaf images were captured using the Canon EOS70D camera. White and fluorescent light was projected onto the leaves using LED lights (Model: SL3500-D) from Photon System Instruments (Drasov, Czech Republic). For GFP fluorescence capture, the lights were adjusted to emit a wavelength of 447 nm (appeared as blue light) and a 460 nm filter was placed on the camera.Images were analyzed using the ImageJ software [43]. Using ImageJ, total leaf area was calculated. Utilizing the color differences between non-silenced and silenced tissue (green vs yellow for _CHLH_ silencing; green vs red for _GFP_ silencing), the total area of silencing was determined. To maintain consistency, the threshold that determined silenced tissue vs non-silenced tissue remained constant for all images taken for an experimental comparison. The percent silencing was then calculated by dividing the total silencing area by the total leaf area.The statistical assessment of differences were conducted for bar charts of all data collections. One-way ANOVA and Fisher\u2019s LSD test was used for RNA quantitation, protein quantitation by western blots, and sandpaper images analysis with the single factor as 5\u2019 nucleotide pair. The data of the siRNA comparison in the protoplast reporter systems was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA and Fisher\u2019s LSD test with 5\u2019pair and sRNA rate as the factors. In all cases, means not followed by the same letter indicate statistical significance (\u03b1 = 0.05).### Protoplast GFP reporter assay of siRNA activityPlasmids were prepared using the Qiagene maxi-prep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The cDNA sequence encoding full length GFP was cloned downstream of a CaMV 35S promoter. The short-fragment of \u201c5\u2019-CGAAGGAGTTATGCGAATACC-3\u2019\u201d matching part of the _CHLH_ transcript was inserted at the 3\u2019 end of _GFP_ sequence to be used as a reporter system for GFP expression when co-transfected with siRNAs to the protoplast.Protoplasts were prepared from whole leaves of 8-11-day-old _N_. _benthamiana_ plants after 3 days etiolation in the dark using an enzyme solution containing cellulase R-10 and macerozyme R-10 (Yakult Pharmaceuticals, Japan) to remove cell walls [44]. PEG-assisted transformation reactions contained 2 \u03bcg of a GFP-expressing plasmid (containing target sequences) and either 3, 0.75, 0.19, or 0.06 \u03bcg of dsRNA, plus transformation controls containing 0.65 \u03bcg of Firefly luciferase and 0.33 \u03bcg of Renilla luciferase plasmids. Control wells had either GFP plasmid only, or no DNA input. Master aliquots of 10 \u03bcL were placed into a separate Falcon 353910 plate(s), in quadruplicate. Post-transformation protoplasts were resuspended with 180 \u03bcL Buffer containing 0.025% BSA and 5 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin and incubated overnight at room temperature. The following day, a 25 \u03bcL aliquot of the incubation mixture was used for luciferase assays using a modified protocol of the Dual-Glo system (Catalog # E2980,Promega Inc) to monitor the protoplast healthiness and transfection effectiveness. Another 25 \u03bcL aliquot of the incubation mixture was used for GFP expression analysis on an Operetta high content imager (Perkin-Elmar). The GFP Intensity Sum per well was calculated for each sample and averaged.### Development of a topical application method for siRNA delivery to _N_. _benthamiana_ leavesTo directly assess the gene silencing effects of siRNAs at both phenotypic and molecular levels, we employed a sandpaper abrasion method to deliver siRNAs to leaves of young _N_. _benthamiana_ plants. The endogenous gene, _CHLH_ , was selected as a candidate because of the previously reported chlorotic phenotypes of its silencing mutant. To incorporate heme required for the synthesis of chlorophyll, the magnesium-protoporphyrin IX chelatase complex consists of three subunits (D, I, and H), and distributes protoporphyrin IX into the branched tetrapyrrolic pathway. Transgenic tobacco ( _Nicotiana tabacum_ ) plants expressing antisense _CHLH_ RNA became deficient in chlorophyll biosynthesis and showed a chlorotic (yellow-spotted) phenotype [45]. A wildtype siRNA duplex (CHL-1 WT, Table 1) with a core 19 mer and an antisense sequence of 5\u2019 UAUUCGCAUAACUCCUUCG plus 3\u2019 2nt overhangs was selected to target the _CHLH_ mRNA (Fig 1A). As a negative control, a mutant version (CHL-1 MT, Table 1)was designed by introducing a 3nt substitution at position 10\u201312 of the antisense strand (AAC -> UUG), to abolish the cleavage activity [46]. Both the wildtype and mutant CHLH siRNAs were formulated in H2O and applied to the wildtype _N_. _benthamiana_ using sandpaper. At 4 days post application (dpa), control leaves applied with mutant or a non-targeting randomized siRNA lacked chlorotic spots. In contrast, leaves treated with 21nt dsRNA duplexes targeting _CHLH_ demonstrated chlorotic spots (covering about 10% of the total leaf area), presumably resulting from the interference with chlorophyll assembly after down-regulation of _CHLH_.Fig 1.  Sandpaper application of siRNA duplexes resulted in an RNAi phenotype.A, Location of siRNAs targeting the _CHLH_ and _GFP_ genomic locations in the _N_. _benthamiana_ wildtype and16C lines. Boxes and lines indicate the exons and introns, respectively. The 21 bp sequences with 2 nt 3\u2019 overhangs were tested as wild type or with mutations shown in red. The top strand is the sense sequence, and the bottom is the antisense sequence of the duplex. Leaves were treated with the indicated siRNA duplexes by sandpaper abrasion and photographed under white (B) or blue light (C) 4 dpa. The phenotypic area was quantified with Image J and was graphed as percent of the treated leaf area; error bars represent standard error of the means. D, _CHLH_ transcript levels were determined in leaves harvested 4 dpa; error bars represent standard error of the means. E, GFP protein levels were determined by western blot from leaf tissues collected 4 dpa. Means not followed by the same letter indicate statistical significance (\u03b1 = 0.05).We additionally tested whether the sandpaper delivery method could be used to effectively silence the GFP transgene present in the 16C line of _N_. _benthamiana_ [47]. GFP emits green fluorescence light that is observed under ultraviolet (UV) light activation. However, when the GFP protein is absent, red chlorophyll autofluorescence is observed under UV light. A 21bp siRNA sequence (GFP-1 WT, Table 1) with a 19bp core and antisense strand of 5\u2019 UUGAAGUUGGCUUUGAUGC was selected to target the _GFP_ transgene (Fig 1A). Similarly, mutations were introduced at antisense positions 10\u201312 to disable siRNA efficacy (GFP-1 MT, Table 1). Leaves subjected to topical sandpaper delivery of dsRNA GFP siRNAs displayed red chlorophyll autofluorescence covering approximately 25% of the total leaf area and demonstrating a lack of GFP protein activity. In contrast, leaves treated with either mutant or non-targeting sequences showed uniform GFP fluorescence under UV light (Fig 1C and S6 Fig). As wasobserved for _CHLH_ , disruption of the 10\u201312 nt of the antisense strand inhibited the red fluorescence phenotype, suggesting these observations resulted from RNAi activity (Fig 1C and S6 Fig).To determine if the observed phenotypes correlated with reduced mRNA levels for the targeted genes, quantitative RT-PCR assays were performed on RNA isolated from leaf punches collected in the phenotypic areas. As expected, treatment with the wildtype siRNA targeting _CHLH_ (CHL-1 WT) resulted in an approximate 50% decrease in _CHLH_ mRNA in comparison to non-treated controls. No reduction in mRNA levels were observed after treatment with either the mutant (CHL-1 MT) or the non-targeting sequence (RANDOMIZED) (Fig 1D). No difference in _GFP_ mRNA levels were observed after treatment with GFP siRNAs in comparison to untreated GFP controls (S2 Fig). To assess whether the observed GFP phenotypes are from reduced GFP protein expression, protein extracts were subjected to western blot analysis using an anti-GFP antibody. As shown in Fig 1E, the GFP protein level was reduced in samples from leaves treated with the wildtype GFP siRNA, but not with the GFP mutant (GFP-1 MT) or the non-targeting siRNA (RANDOMIZED).To assess the relationship between siRNA dose and the intensity of phenotype, leaves were treated with siRNA at two concentrations, 0.5 and 2 \u03bcg/\u03bcl. As shown in S1 Fig, for both _CHLH_ (CHL-1 WT) and _GFP_ (GFP-1 WT), silencing phenotypes were enhanced with an increased dose of the siRNA. No phenotypes were observed with the randomized control siRNA sequences in either doses.These results support the conclusion that the phenotypes generated using the topical sandpaper RNA delivery method are the result of RNAi. We therefore used this topical sandpaper abrasion method to assess the effect of siRNA designs on gene silencing activity.### Effects of siRNAs with variants at the 5\u2019 terminus of antisense strand on gene silencingTo understand the 5\u2019nt requirement for siRNA activity after topical application, four variants of the _GFP_ siRNA were designed by modifying the 5\u2019 nt of the antisense strand, and its corresponding pair on the sense strand (Fig 2 and S7 Fig). The variants tested were U-A, A-U, G-C, and C-G pairs (Table 1), where the first letter denotes the 5\u2019 AS nucleotide identity (position 1 of the AS strand) and the second letter denotes its \u2018pair\u2019 in the opposite strand of the duplex (position 19 of the sense strand). Leaves treated with the native U-A pairing displayed the red spotted phenotype, resulting from loss of GFP expression. A similar phenotype was observed for both C-G and A-U variants, while the leaves treated with G-C variants did not exhibit a red-spotted phenotype. To test whether the introduction of 5\u2019G as the first nt of the antisense strand was the main factor leading to the disappearance of the phenotypes, an additional variant was made which contained the 5\u2019G as the first nt onthe antisense strand mismatched with a non-pairing G on the 19th position of the sense strand. This G-G mismatch variant displayed the red spotted _GFP_ silencing phenotype, at statistically the same level to the leaves treated with the wildtype siRNA. This observation suggests that siRNAs with a 5\u2019G on the antisense strand should not be excluded from siRNA testing when used for topical application.Fig 2.  The influence of the 5\u2019 nucleotide of the antisense strand of a 21nt siRNA duplex on _GFP_ transgene silencing.A, Illustration of interactions between the _GFP_ mRNA and the AS strand of siRNA duplex. dsRNAs with different 5\u2019 nucleotides for the antisense strand (paired with a complementary or identical (G) nucleotide at the sense strand) were tested. B, _GFP_ silenced area was quantified and expressed as percent of the treated leaf area; error bars are standard error of the means. Means not followed by the same letter indicate statistical significance (\u03b1 = 0.05).To further investigate the antisense strand\u2019s first nucleotide pairing state on RNAi efficacy, additional siRNAs targeting _CHLH_ were designed and their efficacy tested (Fig 3, S3 and S8 Figs). From the wildtype siRNA (CHL-1 WT) targeting _CHLH_ , an additional 15 CHL-1 dsRNA variants that included all 5\u2019 antisense strand pairing states of G, A, U, and C (Table 1) were designed. The \u0394\u0394G for each of the siRNAs was calculated based on the difference in free energy for each end of the duplex calculated from the stacking energy of the first 5 pairs of the sequence and the free end loops. The calculated \u0394\u0394G for all variants were below 0, including the duplex CHL-1 GC with a 5\u2019G on the antisense strand paired with a C on the sense strand (Table 1).Fig 3.  The influence of the 5\u2019 nucleotide of a 21 bp dsRNA on silencing the _CHLH_ gene.A, Each 5\u2019 AS nucleotide was tested both in a paired state and in an unpaired states with all other nucleotide possibilities. Leaves were harvested 4 dpa and photographed under white light. B, Phenotypic area was quantified and expressed as percent of the treated leaf area. Means not followed by the same letter indicate statistical significance (\u03b1 = 0.05).Among the plants treated with CHL-1 variants with perfect pairing at the 5\u2019 AS end, CHL-1 WT siRNA (5\u2019 U-A), CHL-1 AU, and CHL-1 CG all displayed the chlorotic phenotypes. No chlorotic phenotype was observed for the CHL-1 GC variant (Fig 3 and S8 Fig). Compared to the _CHLH_ mRNA level in the control treatments (Sandpaper only, untreated, and GFP siRNA), varied degrees of transcript reduction of _CHLH_ were detected in all the variants except the CHL-1 GC (S3 Fig). Treatments with CHL-1 variants with mismatches between the 5\u2019 AS nucleotide and its sense pair presented chlorotic spots of varied intensity, suggesting they are capable of knocking down the _CHLH_ transcript to produce a phenotype. Introduction of a mismatched state at the 5\u2019 antisense strand in the siRNA allows for activity of 5\u2019G designed siRNA.### RNAi effects by siRNAs variants in protoplastsTo quantify dose effects of the siRNA variants in RNA silencing, we used a protoplast transient assay [48, 49]. A siRNA reporter plasmid containing a _GFP_ gene that had a short stretch of _CHLH_ sequence (5\u2019-CGAAGGAGTTATGCGAATACC-3\u2019) embedded in the 3\u2019 end immediately after the translational stop codon was constructed to test siRNA efficacy (Fig 4 and S4 Fig). The plasmid and one of the sixteen variant siRNAs were co-transfected into _N_. _benthamiana_ leaf protoplasts. An efficacious siRNA should recognize the embedded _CHLH_ target sequence and elicit the RNAi gene silencing pathway, resulting in a decrease of GFP fluorescence signal. The optimal amount of plasmid for the assay was determined to be 2 \u03bcg by a titration experiment (S5 Fig). All 16 variants of siRNAs targeting _CHLH_ were applied at 0.06, 0.19, 0.75 and 3 \u03bcg per sample. With the increased amount of siRNA, a reduction of GFP signal was observed for all the variant siRNAs applied (Fig 4). As was seen for the topicallyapplied sample, the siRNA containing a 5\u2019 G-C on the antisense strand did not suppress the GFP fluorescence as efficiently as all the other variants. At 0.19 \u03bcg siRNA, the intensity of GFP fluorescence was similar as those after treatment with the randomized negative control (Fig 4B). Even at the highest amount tested (3 \u03bcg), the GFP fluorescence level remained at about 80% of the negative control. This observation, consistent with data in Fig 3, supports that silencing by an siRNA starting with 5\u2019G-C on the antisense strand is inefficient. In contrast, the mismatched siRNA variants beginning with 5\u2019 AS G all showed significant efficacy compared to controls.Fig 4.  Silencing of a _GFP_ : _CHLH_ -fragment fusion in protoplasts was used to measure the efficiency of silencing for sixteen _CHLH_ siRNA variants.A, Diagram of the siRNA reporter plasmid containing the _GFP_ : _CHLH_ fragment:3\u2019 UTR cassette for gene suppression in protoplasts, the synthetic siRNAs, and the representative protoplast images captured by Oppereta imager of no plasmid, plasmid only, plasmid + CHL-1 UA, and plasmid + CHL-1 GC. B, siRNAs as described in the legend to Fig 3 were transfected together with the _GFP_ : _CHLH_ -fragment fusion, and GFP fluorescence was quantified at 525 nm with 488 nm excitation. Means not followed by the same letter indicate statistical significance (\u03b1 = 0.05).### Activation of siRNA by introducing 5\u2019 mismatch nucleotidesThe native sequences tested so far were selected having a 5\u2019U on the antisense strand as one of the initial design criteria. We therefore asked whether a siRNA sequence beginning with a native 5\u2019G was capable of reducing gene expression and whether an introduction of 5\u2019 terminal mismatches or 5\u2019 U substitutions could activate or enhance any silencing properties. Three different siRNAs were selected in the middle region of the _CHLH_ gene with the following criteria: GC % at between 40% to 50%, \u0394\u0394G less than 0, Reynolds score >5, and oligo MFE < or equal to 0 (Fig 5A and 5B). Two variant types were created for all three native siRNA duplexes. In the first set, a mismatched state was incorporated by substituting position 19 of the sense with a G, resulting in a G-G mismatch. In the second set of siRNA sequences, the 5\u2019 G on the AS strand was substituted with a 5\u2019 U and a compensatory A on the sense strand was also incorporated. As shown in Fig 5C and S9 Fig, no chlorotic phenotype wasobserved after treatment with the native sequences starting with a 5\u2019G-C. In contrast, both the 5\u2019 G-G mismatch and 5\u2019 U-A substitution in all three variant siRNA groups led to chlorotic phenotypes.Fig 5.  siRNAs containing a 5\u2019 G can be efficacious for gene silencing when the nucleotide on the antisense strand is the non-complementary G or when a U-A pair is substituted.A, Location of three 21nt siRNAs in the _CHLH_ genomic sequence in the _N_. _benthamiana_. Boxes and lines indicate the exons and introns, respectively. These siRNAs were synthesized in their native form as a G-C pairing at the 5\u2019 end of AS strand or substituted with a G-G mismatch or U-A pairing. The nucleotides of 1st position of AS and 19th position of S strands are shaded in grey. B, Key properties for the siRNAs tested were compared (40, 41). C, siRNA duplexes were applied to _N_. _benthamiana_ leaves with sandpaper abrasion, and treated leaves were photographed under white light 4 dpa.In this study, we demonstrated that siRNA duplexes delivered into _N_. _benthamiana_ leaves using the sandpaper abrasion method is an effective procedure for activity assessment of exogenously applied siRNA duplexes. Overall, both topically applied siRNAs and siRNAs transformed into plant protoplasts showed consistent gene silencing effects in terms of generation of a phenotype, mRNA or protein reduction, and loss of activity after incorporating slicer mutations into the siRNA sequences.One known consideration relating to siRNA activity is sorting and incorporation into an AGO effector protein. Plants have an expanded family of diverse AGO proteins and the number of family members varies with the plant species [9, 50]. As examples, there are 9 AGO genes in _N_. _benthamiana_ [51], 10 AGO genes in Arabidopsis [52] and 19 in rice [53]. These different AGOs have specialized functions in plant development, defense, and genome maintenance based on expression pattern and by selectively binding to different classes of siRNAs [54\u201357]. The AGO protein or proteins utilized with topical RNAi remains unknown. It is possible that multiple AGO proteins may be involved in gene silencing after topical application of siRNAs [2, 8, 25, 58, 59]. Further biochemical or genetic might help elucidate the AGO preference component of topically applied siRNAs.The preference of a 5\u2019U at the antisense strand of an efficacious siRNA has been reported in both plants and animals and widely used as a criterion for designing siRNA [25, 26, 39, 40, 60]. In plants, most of the endogenous miRNA populations have a 5\u2019 U and are produced by DCL from a precursor structure with base pairing at that 5\u2019 AS position. Among the 162 identified naturally occurring miRNA in _N_. _tabacum_ (http://www.mirbase.org/), none of the mature miRNAs contains a 5\u2019 AS mismatch. Endogenous siRNAs produced through an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase would also have perfect base-pairing prior to DCL cleavage. The sandpaper based application method allowed for an opportunity to evaluate the specific base-pairing effects of 5\u2019 nt when exogenous siRNA molecules were topically applied.The silencing efficacy between siRNA with 5\u2019 AS GC (non active) and the 5\u2019 CG (active) for both CHL-1 and GFP-1 variants may appear surprising when considering both versions have the similar pairing energy. We speculate this difference could result from the \u0394\u0394Gs that takes into consideration both the stacking energy and the pairing energy when using the nearest neighboring models. In fact, the CG versions for both CHL-1 and GFP-1 are both at -1.2 while that of the GC version are -0.3 and -0.4 for GHL-1 and GFP-1, respectively. An additional influencing factor could be the binding preference and affinity of the 1st nucleotide of the AS strand to the corresponding AGO protein [26].The observation that most of the variant siRNAs designs we tested in relation to 5\u2019 nt identity and pairing states can be efficacious, either when applied topically or co-transfected with a reporter plasmid in protoplasts was intriguing. Furthermore, the ability to activate non-efficacious duplexes (GC at the 5\u2019 AS) through incorporation of mismatch states suggested that this property is an important one to consider during the siRNA design process. The modifications made to enhance or activate siRNA duplex activity would lower the 5\u2019 stability of the antisense end, potentially promoting the preferential incorporation of the correct targeting strand into the RISC complex [31, 32]. Previous studies have shown that strand selection is a fundamental step for the correct strand to load into the RISC complex [31, 40, 61]. These results highlight the critical step of 5\u2019 instability for strand selection and our finding suggests that the decreasing the relative stability of the 5\u2019 antisense endmay override the nucleotide identity requirement for topically applied synthetic siRNAs. Reactivation of non-functional siRNAs by incorporation of a mismatch state within the duplex or with a non-native 5\u2019 U is also consistent with the role of the first nucleotide of the antisense strand not participating in seed region or slicing activity [26, 62].In summary, this work demonstrates that all 5\u2019AS nucleotides can be incorporated into an effective siRNA design for topical or _in planta_ application, providing a broader swath of efficacious siRNA sequences for gene silencing.### S1 Fig. Gene silencing by siRNAs applied using sandpaper abrasion was dose dependent.A, Leaves were treated with the indicated triggers at 2 concentrations by sandpaper abrasion and were photographed 4 dpa under white or blue light.

The publication says that Michael B. Jordan's production company Outlier Society is developing the project, which has a first-look deal with the online retailer and streaming service.Anders' novel came out earlier this year and follows a high schooler named Tina Maines, who has a secret: she's not really a mild-mannered kid trying to etch out a teenage existence on Earth\u2014she has an rescue beacon that'll one day activate and bring her out into space to help save the world and go off on all the adventures that she's dreamed of.There's a little more to the story: She's a clone of Captain Thaoh Argentian, a brilliant tactician and commander of the Royal Fleet, which is engaged in an interstellar war, and it's losing. It's up to Tina to take on the job of her predecessor, and surrounded by her crew and friends, she has to figure out how to lead them to victory.According to _Variety_ , Amazon and Outlier Society has yet to line up a writer for the project. Jordan will serve as an executive producer, as well as Elizabeth Raposo (of Outlier Society). Anders, Dan Halstead, and Nate Miller will also serve as executive producers for the project. On Twitter, Anders explained that the project would be a TV series, and that she was excited about the conversations she's had about it with the folks involved.> This is an ambitious project with the potential to uplift characters who don't always get a chance to save the galaxy. It's about valuing chosen family over a single chosen one, and working together. I've loved everything Elizabeth Raposo, Kevin Jarzynski et al have had to say.> -- Charlie Jane Anders (EVEN GREATER MISTAKES 11/16!) (@charliejane) September 13, 2021This isn't the first project of Anders' to be optioned: way back in 2013, NBC optioned her Tor.com story _Six Months, Three Days_ for a series, and back in 2019, Sony TV picked up her novel _The City in the Middle of the Night_ for a series _._  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)  * Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)  * Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)adaptationsCharlie Jane AndersnewsVictories Greater Than Death  * ## _Y: The Last Man_ Kicks Off Its Post-XY Apocalypse with a Tick\u2026 Tick\u2026 BOOM  * ## Amazon Is Developing a Live-Action _She-Ra_ Series  * ## The Holidays Are Coming in First Trailer for Marvel's _Hawkeye_  * ## _Halloween Kills_ Will Debut in Theaters and on Peacock Simultaneously__ Back to the top of the pageMore Comments Check for New CommentsReceive notification by email when a new comment is added.

Cash flow from investment activities mostly refers to capitalized work for own account in the form of product development.Dear Heliospectra AB (publ) Shareholder,  Despite experiencing many of the same COVID driven challenges that most global industries have endured \u2013 such as supply chain issues, delayed investments, and economic uncertainty \u2013 we have made measurable progress during the first half-year. If we isolate the effect of the order cancelation from Nectar Farms, we have received orders to date which outpace 2020 by 443% while our sales for the half year drop by 6% compared to same period last year. The operating cost has been adjusted to cope with our current market situation which resulted in improving EBITDA by 27,7% compared to the previous year. We have also made great strides in productizing our patented biosensor technology and we are increasingly optimistic of our development of this revolutionary solution.The Nectar Farms order cancellation was another byproduct of the uncontrollable circumstances created by COVID. Unfortunately, the customer was unable to raise an adequate level of funding in time. Although this was a bitter pill to swallow, our organization should feel proud that such a big client chose Heliospectra LED grow lights above all else after nearly three years of vigorous product and competitive analysis.Looking ahead, we are excited about nearing the commercialization of our patented biosensor technology. This is a game changer that will not only improve our position in this space, but also solidify our reputation as a technologically innovative company. The patented biosensor technology will revolutionize the CEA (controlled environment agriculture) industry by allowing growers to communicate with their crops and dynamically adjust production requirements. For example, this technology will alert growers to the type of light the crop needs at different stages of its growth. By being able to respond to the crop's needs in \"real time\", growers will be able to cultivate higher quality crops at a faster rate with much less crop waste and thus significantly increase their profit. We have already passed the functional validation of our solution and fielded a significant amount of commercial and research interest. As such, we will continue to focus on finalizing this product and bringing itto market early next year.In parallel, we are also working hard to optimize our product offerings and expand our global presence in the marketplace. We are working on a comprehensive solution that combines our industry leading light fixtures with our control platform and biosensor technology. By offering this packaged solution we hope to further support and meet the expanding needs of both our existing and future customers. We have also been focused on expanding our global presence by strengthening our sales channels. Heliospectra has partnered with two new resellers. MineARC Systems, a global leader in manufacturing and supply of controlled environments, will represent Heliospectra's products and solutions in the Australian market. Harahara Inc., a long-term supplier of cultivation solutions, will be doing the same for the controlled environment agriculture and PFALs markets in Japan.

The report covers the entire market of cancer vaccines, which includes two main areas of application, prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic vaccines. Discussion of human papillomavirus vaccines and hepatitis B vaccines that indirectly act against cancer is also included in the report.Patent analysis, clinical trials, innovative research and opportunities of the newest trends within the cancer vaccine market and comprehensive profiles of companies that lead the cancer vaccine industry are also discussed.Cancer therapy remains a challenge despite advances in diagnostics and on-hand therapies. Available cancer therapies have side effects and are especially less effective in recurrent cancers. Over the past few years, the concept of recruiting the entire immune system to fight cancer has been at the forefront of cancer research.To develop efficacious cancer vaccines, researchers have explored an array of different approaches, such as peptide vaccines and dendritic cell vaccines. Some of the cancer vaccines showed tantalizing results, but real success is still awaited. The majority of vaccines developed and tested were unable to boost the body's immune system to a point where these vaccination strategies could be effectively utilized to cure cancer; thus, only a few vaccines are presently in the market.Cancer vaccines can be broadly categorized into therapeutic vaccines and prophylactic vaccines. Therapeutic vaccines, as the name suggests, are intended to treat existing cancer, whereas prophylactic, or preventive, vaccines are used to prevent cancer from developing in healthy people.In April 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Provenge, a prostate cancer vaccine, making researchers optimistic about the success of therapeutic cancer vaccines. In the wake of highly unmet need, a number of pharmaceutical companies entered into the cancer vaccines market.Moreover, dwindling research and development (R&D) and an increasing number of patent expirations forced pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into this lucrative market through collaborations and licensing agreements.Merck & Co., GlaxoSmithKline and Dendreon Corp. (now part of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.) are the three leading companies in the market.Because the cancer vaccine market is in its infancy, there are a limited number of products in the market. Increasing incidence of cancer, unavailability of efficacious treatments and the necessity to reduce the global burden of cancer are major driving forces for the market. High manufacturing costs and competition from comparatively low-cost therapies are the two biggest hurdles in the way of success.  * History of Cancer and Its Management **Chapter 4 Impact of COVID-19 on the Market**  * Regulatory History of Approved Cancer Vaccines **Chapter 6 Market Breakdown by Type****Chapter 7 Market Breakdown by Application**  * Cancer Vaccines Application in Various Cancers **Chapter 8 Market Breakdown by Region**  * Immunicum Ab For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/ajcyqkResearch and Markets  Laura Wood, Senior Manager  For E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470  For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630  For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900U.S. Fax: 646-607-1904  Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716SOURCE Research and Markets###  Global Cardiovascular Partnering Deals Report/Directory 2021:...###  Global Aircraft Battery Market (2021 to 2026) - Featuring...More news releases in similar topicsfrom 8 AM - 9 PM ETMy Services ____Cision Distribution Helpline  Copyright \u00a9 2021 Cision US Inc."}

MohrWomble Bond Dickinson (US) LLPNorth Carolina Business Court# Limiting Access to Non-Specialized Suppliers Can Be a Legitimate Business InterestWednesday, September 1, 2021Where a business\u2019 non-compete employment agreement precluded its former employee from contacting its suppliers, such restriction could constitute a legitimate business interest. KNC Technologies v. Tutton, 2021 NCBC 25 (J. McGuire). This was so, the Business Court held, even though the items the supplier provided were available elsewhere in the marketplace.Defendant was Plaintiff\u2019s employee who, prior to ending his employment, allegedly took Plaintiff\u2019s trade secrets and gave them to his soon-to-be new employer, a competitor of Plaintiff. Plaintiff sued Defendant, and the parties entered into a settlement agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) in which Defendant agreed that he would not contact any of Plaintiff\u2019s customers or suppliers for a period of ten (10) years. After signing the Agreement, Defendant eventually started a new company, I-Tech. Through I-Tech, Defendant contacted several of Plaintiff\u2019s customers and suppliers. Plaintiff sued for breach of the Agreement. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment contending, _inter alia_ , that the Agreement\u2019s restriction on contacting suppliers was unenforceable because it did not further Plaintiff\u2019s legitimate business interest.The Business Court disagreed. Although all parties agreed that the products Defendant sought from the various suppliers could be obtained from other suppliers in the marketplace\u2014and thus there was nothing unique about the supplier\u2019s products\u2014the Business Court nonetheless held that Plaintiff\u2019s effort to limit the suppliers available to Defendant\u2019s competing business could constitute a legitimate business interest (although the Business Court did not identify the actual interest at issue). As a result, Plaintiff\u2019s restrictive covenant prohibiting Defendant from contacting certain suppliers was enforceable.As a result of this decision, a business should carefully consider including certain of its suppliers (in addition to customers) within any employment agreements with an employee, as such restriction might hinder the employee from leaving and later competing against the business.  * A ten-year restrictive covenant unrelated to the sale of a business is not enforceable as a matter of law (Opinion, \u00b647).  * A contract\u2019s liquidated damages provision is enforceable only if damages are difficult to calculate and the listed amount is a reasonable estimate of damages caused by the breach ( _Id_., \u00b667-69).  * A party\u2019s intentional breach of a contract could support an unfair and deceptive trade claim even if the evidence of a legitimate business interest was \u201ctenuous.\u201d ( _Id_., \u00b659,89)Copyright \u00a9 2021 Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP All Rights Reserved.National Law Review, Volume XI, Number 244How the Law Is Grappling With Free Expression, COVID-19, Diversity, and MoreJustin T.

Marshall/Getty)While superhero characters may still be all the rage when it comes to the new series streaming platforms give the green light to, Amazon\u2019s banking on audiences being in the mood for something a bit different for its next big adaptation.Deadline reports that Michael B. Jordan\u2019s Outlier Society production company is working on an Amazon Studios series adaptation of Gizmodo co-founder Charlie Jane Anders\u2019 _Victories Greater Then Death_, the first instalment in her _Unstoppable_ trilogy. Like the novel, Amazon\u2019s _Victories Greater Than Death_ will tell the story of Tina Mains, a seemingly ordinary teenage girl who\u2019s hiding a massive secret about who she is. Unbeknownst to her friends, Tina\u2019s a clone of a hero from an alien world tasked with keeping a guarding a beacon hidden on Earth away from an evil threatening to destroy multiple worlds.Though Tina always know that the time would come when she had to embrace her destiny to become a hero like her genetic template, actually following through on said destiny proves harder than she expected when the call comes. From a synopsis:> \u201cHigh school can be rough. It\u2019s hard to fit in, yet impossible to be invisible, and when everyone is desperately trying to figure out who they are and where they are going in life it doesn\u2019t help Tina that she\u2019s hiding a deep secret. She\u2019s the keeper of an interplanetary beacon that will activate someday soon, calling her home as the clone of an alien charged with saving the galaxy.> But, for as much as she feels destined to fulfil her mission, she first has to grapple with the complications with the humans in her life. As Tina prepares to take on her journey with a group of teenage girls, they must grapple with learning to trust themselves and each other in this coming-of-age adventure.\u201dAnders, who just released an inspiring book about writing entitled _Never Say You Can\u2019t Survive: How to Get Through Hard Times by Making Up Stories_, tweeted her excitement about the project:> At last I can talk about it!

The Swedish Medical Products Agency has given approval to start the study.**The purpose of the study is to evaluate the systemic uptake of cobitolimod in local treatment of colonic inflammation. The study will include at least 6 patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis treated with doses of 500 mg of cobitolimod administered rectally.

This latest offering on the Jetty platform was developed and brought to market with the backing of a new, $23M equity financing round from investors that include Citi and Flourish Ventures.Jetty Introduces Jetty RentAccording to data from the National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC), in the first six months of 2021 an average of 21% of renters failed to pay their rent by the 6th of the month*, a cutoff date that would typically trigger late fees from property owners. The federal eviction moratorium restricted the charging of late fees, but with the moratorium now partially lifted, many renters will once again be facing this financial challenge.\"It's a tricky situation\u2014property managers need predictable cash flow to meet their financial obligations, yet forcing renters to meet rigid, first-of- the-month payment dates doesn't reflect the financial realities of today's renter population,\" said Mike Rudoy, Co-Founder and CEO of Jetty. \"We solved this monthly headache with Jetty Rent, which gives renters more flexibility with payment while at the same time offering property managers the reliable cash flow they need.\"With Jetty Rent, Jetty will pay rent on behalf of renters on the first of the month and renters will then have until the 24th of each month to repay Jetty, which they can do in one lump sum or through installments..To launch Jetty Rent, the company partnered with Cortland, a top 20** real estate investment, development and management company, who rolled out the offering to residents across a portfolio of properties.\"At Cortland, we're focused on improving the resident experience, and the process of paying rent is a massive part of that,\" said Jonathan Kirn, Director of Ancillary Services at Cortland. \"Jetty Rent makes life easier on our residents and takes the burden of rent collection off our shoulders\u2014it's a true win-win.\"Jetty Rent is the latest product to be offered by Jetty.

Yeatts__Share on Facebook __Share on Twitter __Share on Linkedin __Share via Email __Share via ShortlinkShare via ShortlinkJetty co-founder and CEO Mike Rudoy (iStock, Jetty)Late rent payments are a problem not only for renters, who bear the cost of exorbitant late fees, but also for property owners, who depend on steady income. Jetty, a Silicon Valley-backed rental insurance provider, says it has a solution for both.The company launched its new product, Jetty Rent, Sept. 8. For a fee of a few dollars, Jetty will cover rent on behalf of the renter, and the renter has until the 24th of the month to meet his or her obligations. Jetty Rent allows users to pay in installments.The product comes at a pivotal moment in the housing market, as the federal eviction moratorium ends and laid-off or under-employed renters struggle to make ends meet during the pandemic\u2019s long tail.Roughly 54% of consumers in the U.S. \u2014 125 million adults across a broad range of ages and incomes \u2014 live paycheck-to-paycheck, with little or no money left after spending their monthly income, according to recent research conducted by LendingClub Bank.Jetty, which was founded in 2016 and completed a Series B round in 2019, raised $23 million in equity financing for the product launch, with backing from Citi and Flourish Ventures. The raise bring\u2019s Jetty\u2019s total funding to-date to $78 million.Another startup called Flex offers a similar flexible rent solution. Jetty differentiates itself with more comprehensive financial services, including rental insurance and a security deposit alternative, CEO Mike Rudoy said.Property managers want a one-stop solution, he said. \u201cWe are attempting to become the financial services platform for the entire rental real estate industry. Our partners have effectively called out for consolidation of products.\u201dThe outlook for the business has not always been rosy. Jetty laid off 40% of its workforce across several departments in early 2020, just as the pandemic hit.Today, the company\u2019s headcount sits at about 100, Rudoy said. The new funds will be used to make new hires and build out the Jetty Rent product nationally. Jetty\u2019s landlord and property manager client base, comprised mostly of large institutions, collectively own 2.2 million units.Jetty will undertake a Series C round \u201cin short order,\u201d Rudoy said, declining to offer a specific timeline.Keith Rabois\u2019 Khosla Ventures led Jetty\u2019s $26 million Series B round in 2019.

As a certified VAT service provider eClear is responsible for ensuring that all transactions are screened for AML compliance risks, so that no sanctioned entity or individual is able to illegally launder funds using eClear services.

This partnership provides us with enhanced AML risk management capabilities, without adding complexity to our customer experience or own business processes. We are delighted to be working with an advanced technology partner like Fraugster who makes things simple and seamless\".Fraugster Co-CEO Christian Mangold states, \"AML risk affects any organisation processing transactions - from banks to e-commerce merchants. But when it comes to handling escrow money, regulatory scrutiny is even greater, which is why we are working with eClear to ensure that they meet the very highest standards of AML risk management and compliance, without adding unnecessary complexity to their customers and operations\".Fraugster is a Berlin based payment security company. Fraugster enables the world's leading merchants, global payment companies like Worldline and Ratepay to intelligently manage the impact of fraud to minimise the costs of fraud, maximise revenue and improve customer experience.

Courtesy photo##  Madison Avenue shuffle: Nello eyes relocation, Cipriani could move in##  NYC's Nello has liquor license suspended for COVID-19 violations##  Soccer star drops hundreds on pricey NYC pasta##  Ex-beauty queen hits NYC dining scene after ditching hubby in ItalyAfter Page Six reported that celebrity haunt Nello is potentially relocating -- and that Cipriani could take over its 696 Madison space -- rumors have been swirling that the eatery's original owner, Nello Balan, could be involved.The fiery restauranteur stepped away from his eponymous Madison Avenue spot in 2015, telling us at the time that things were not working out with new business partner Thomas Makos. \"It was like a marriage that didn\u2019t work,\" he'd said.After our story ran, Balan -- who'd been at the helm of Nello for 25 years -- was spotted by several people in Southampton at a Cirpriani food truck located outside of Blu Mar.Not only that -- but another source told us they spotted Balan walking on the Upper East Side with the landlord of the 696 Madison space, and that Balan was overheard telling someone in the neighborhood he was \"on his way back.\"The source speculated, \"One plus one equals two,\" and it \"looks to me like [Cipriani] are fronting for him.\"But Balan says it's not true. \"No, about Nello. No, about the landlord!\" he wrote in an exclamation mark-heavy email. \"Nello was long ago destroyed! It is sad of course to see it empty all the time! I hope Cipriani will take it!\"\"No, about Nello. No, about the landlord!\" Balan, pictured here in 2011, told Page Six of the rumors.Zandy MangoldHe added of the Southampton sighting: \"I\u2019m not working in any food trucks. Cipriani is launching 'Cipriani at Home' on his own he doesn\u2019t need anyone to do it for him. My daughter, Lucy, is helping with [the] Southampton operation.\" He added, \"I love to see her! Taste the delicious food that Cipriani serves!  I also took some food home! I had a small party, everybody loves it!While Balan is very enthusiastic about the brand, he says he isn't working for them (though perhaps he should be its publicist?).\"Giuseppe Cipriani is the top world restauranteur and yes I admire him,\" Balan said. \"No, I don\u2019t work for him! I wished! But he will fire me probably, so I chose the friendship, much more safe!!!\"He also added, \"God bless America, now we need more prayers and hope that the world will get rid of this terrible pandemic that affects everyone and especially this most beautiful business when people can go to a restaurant a bar to enjoy and forget the daily stress!\"Balan told us he's currently splitting time between Rome and the Hamptons -- and that he's getting married soon.He'd been in hot water with the IRS for years, and in 2017 his company Be My Guest LLC \u2014 which hoped to open an ambitious new space on West 58th Street \u2014 filed voluntary bankruptcy papers. An outpost of Nello in Aspen, Colo., was also shuttered after six months with more than $300,000 in liens from suppliers, according to local reports.Reps for Cipriani did not respond to request for comment. Cipriani, already has five NYC locations. They're opening Casa Cipriani, a private club and hotel in the Battery Maritime Building this month.A rep for Nello previously said of relocating, \"There have been ongoing discussions between Thomas and the landlord\u2026 But we\u2019ve been offered dozens of places to relocate the Nello brand. Nello may not be at that location. It might be a few feet away, or across the street \u2014 but it\u2019s definitely not going out of business. It\u2019s a staple of NYC, it\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201dFiled under nello  ,  nello balan  ,  restaurants  ,  8/23/21  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)  * Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Shop Hailey Bieber's Free People Fleece that's all over he...Most Popular This WeekCharlie Sheen, Denise Richards\u2019 daughter claims she was \u2018trapped\u2019 in \u2018abusive\u2019 homeMegan Fox, Kourtney Kardashian introduce 'future baby daddies' at VMAs 2021Bennifer 2.0 makes red carpet debut at Venice Film FestivalBritney Spears posts unfiltered underwear video: 'This is really my ass'Conor McGregor and Machine Gun Kelly brawl on VMAs red carpetJennifer Aniston's awkward TV interview leaves viewers cringing  1.

Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesHome rental financial services company **Jetty** announced today that it has launched Jetty Rent, a new product designed to give tenants flexibility in paying their monthly rent. Jetty Rent was developed and brought to market with the backing of a new $23 million equity financing round from investors that include **Citi** and **Flourish Ventures** , according to a statement from Jetty.Having initially created Jetty Deposit, a product that helps renters replace an expensive security deposit with a low-cost monthly policy, the fintech-meets-proptech firm has now set its sights on monthly rental payments, said **Mike Rudoy** , co-founder and CEO at Jetty.SEE ALSO: Thomas Bradford Is Hines\u2019 New Proptech Guru\"The next big problem that we saw was that renters were facing, basically, a liquidity challenge,\u201d Rudoy said, \"especially with folks that might be in the gig economy, who might be living paycheck to paycheck and might have unexpected bills that come up.\u201dRudoy continued: \"If they don't [have the rent], they're typically hit with a high late fee that can oftentimes compound and lead to chronic delinquency, abandonment and eviction. That is the problem that we are trying to solve with Jetty Rent. We are trying to provide renters with financial flexibility to pay their rent on a schedule that works for their lifestyle.\u201dJetty Rent works on a monthly subscription model for renters, starting at $15 a month, Rudoy said. \"If you think about what a typical late fee is, it could be upwards of 8 percent of someone's monthly rent. So, $15 as a starting point is well below that, if you think about the average rent in the country being $1,200. For that $15 a month, the renter is now able to pay their rent up to 24 days into the month to Jetty, while we pay the property manager 100 percent of the rent on the first of the month.\"So, unlike a payday loan, where you have extremely high [annual percentage rates], and the cost of that loan actually goes up over time if you are delinquent, our product does not charge interest fees for late payments. You can think about it as a flat monthly subscription.\u201dJetty Rent is a month-to-month product, Rudoy said. \"If the renter does not pay us within those 24 days, we won't give them the opportunity to use Jetty Rent for the subsequent month, until such a point that they pay us back or make us whole on that payment. As soon as that happens, they can come back onto the program. And so, we think that there's actually a level of financial discipline that is embedded in the product design. Unlike a credit card, where people can rack up debt by putting their rent on their card month over month, this simultaneously provides flexibility, but also makes sure that they are paying off the product.\u201dJetty cited data from the **National Multifamily Housing Council** (NMHC) that said in the first six months of 2021, an average of 21 percent of renters failed to pay their rent by the sixth of the month, a cutoff date that would typically trigger late fees from property owners. The federal eviction moratorium restricted the charging of late fees, but with the moratorium now partially lifted, many renters will once again be facing this financial challenge.The other thing that Jetty Rent is attempting to do is help property managers improve their cash flow, said Rudoy. Property managers are able to receive 100 percent of the rent on the first of the month, as well as improve their renter experience. \u201cNo longer are they going to be chasing after tenants to receive rent payments. Now, they are giving renters the ability to pay on their own schedule. Ultimately, we are trying to solve a delinquency abandonment and eviction problem, which is a huge cost burden and legal liability for property managers and owners.\u201dTo launch Jetty Rent, the company partnered with **Cortland** , a top 20 real estate investment, development and management company, and rolled out the offering to residents across a portfolio of properties.\"At Cortland, we\u2019re focused on improving the resident experience, and the process of paying rent is a massive part of that,\u201d said **Jonathan Kirn** , director of ancillary services at Cortland. \"Jetty Rent makes life easier on our residents and takes the burden of rent collection off our shoulders \u2014 it\u2019s a true win-win.\u201d\"Embedded finance platforms like Jetty are quickly becoming one of the most influential technology trends taking place around the world \u2014 one where the customer\u2019s experience with such things as online payments and loans comes first,\u201d said **Emmalyn Shaw** , managing partner at Flourish Ventures. \"We\u2019re thrilled to back the Jetty team as they continue to develop their fintech platform and product offerings to help reach those who need relief and flexibility with meeting housing costs.\u201d_Philip Russo can be reached at_ _prusso@commercialobserver.com_ _._Keywords:Cortland, Emmalyn Shaw, Flourish Ventures, Jetty, Jetty Rent, Jonathan Kirn, Mike Rudoy, National Multifamily Housing CouncilLeases  \u00b7  IndustrialNew York City#### Life Sciences Company Aanika Biosciences Expands to 3K SF at Industry CityFinance  \u00b7  ConstructionNew York City#### One Boerum Place Developers Nab $177M Recap From QuadReal, Global HoldingsFinance  \u00b7  Refinance#### Witkoff, PPG Recap South Florida Golf Course With $55M ConnectOne LoanLeases  \u00b7  Office#### Pet Retailer Chewy Signs HQ Sublease at Plantation Pointe### Thomas Bradford Is Hines\u2019 New Proptech Guru### Where to Find Proptech\u2019s Second Cities in the USSales  \u00b7  Technology### Proptech Firm VirtualAPT Rebrands as View LabsRead the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!(C) 2021 Observer Media Terms Privacy Cookie Settings Do not sell my data Sitemap"}

Let's take a look.Published Sat, Sep 4 2021 5:05 PM CDTRating: 75%Producer / Publisher: Paramount PicturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on RedditEmail to a friendVIEW GALLERY - 5 IMAGES### Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull 4K Blu-ray ReviewA lot has been written and read regarding the fourth final installment in the _Indiana Jones_ saga, and most of it is unkind. Is that reputation fair? Somewhat. But the biggest difference between the films of old and their most recent incarnation is the audience. It's changed. In shades of similarity with the _Star Wars_ prequels, the entire blame can't be heaped at the feet of George Lucas. Audiences have grown up since 1989, and their expectations have changed, but Indy has remained rather stagnant.Admittedly, _Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_ is hardly the height of the franchise, but really is it much worse than _Temple of Doom_ 's egregious tonal shifts and screaming Kate Capshaw? Unfortunately, _Crystal Skull_ 's worst crimes are an over-reliance on less than stellar computer graphics and a lopsided plot which has its most impressive sequences early on, before losing steam in its third act. This contrasts sharply with the gang literally riding to the sunset at the conclusion of _The Last Crusade_ , which served as the perfect wrap.Still, with the fifth and final installment scheduled for release in 2022, the filmmakers (led by director James Mangold) have one last chance to close the door on the franchise the right way. Until then, and in celebration of the 40th anniversary of _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ , Paramount Pictures and Lucasfilm have produced a stunning 4K Blu-ray set, which includes the four current entries in the series, alongside a Blu-ray disc of bonus features. Let's jump in._Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_ is presented in its original aspect ratio of 2.39:1, encoded with H.265 compression and finished with a Dolby Vision pass, in addition to a base HDR-10 layer.Like its three predecessors, _Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_ was lensed on 35mm negative but took full advantage of digital tools developed during editing and post-production and was ultimately finished in a 2K digital intermediate. To date, that 2K master has been the source of all subsequent DVD and Blu-ray releases. Still, for this 4K release, Paramount has gone back to the negative and assembled a brand new 4K digital intermediate and color grade, with digital visual effects shots upscaled from 2K.Offering some subtle improvements to image clarity and sharpness, with some minor digital tinkering and framing, the real upgrade is in the new color grading, which is a huge upgrade, eschewing the horrid chartreuse tones that permeated throughout. Pulling back to a more neutral tone really assists in making the film blend a little more with its predecessors. It sounds minor, but it's really not.Overall, this was an excellent presentation, and without doubt, the definitive presentation of the film released to home video. Paramount should be heartily congratulated for going the extra mile to re-assemble the film and right the wrongs of the previous releases._Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_ is presented with a newly remixed Dolby Atmos object-based audio track.Unlike its predecessors _Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_ was already a robust, contemporary 5.1 sound mix, but this subtle reworking for the Dolby Atmos format by original sound designer Ben Burtt introduces some subtle enhancements to height surround and a slightly wider soundstage. While hardly the most aggressive sound mix on the format, it rolls along confidently and responds appropriately to the on-screen action, including the nuke town sequence, which offers some superb low-end intensity. The classic Indiana Jones sound effects are here in abundance, but they too have been bought kicking and screaming the 21st century, sounding a little more realistic and refined than its forebears.It's not going to win any awards, but _Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_ transfers very well to Atmos.Bar two _Theatrical Trailers_ (both presented in 1080p), all of the bonus material is included on the 5th disc of the collection, along with bonus features for the other three _Indiana Jones_ films. In this section, I'll not only talk about the bonus features exclusively relevant to _Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_ , but also the remaining extra features that are relevant to the franchise as a whole.Included from the initial two-disc Blu-ray release from 2008 is a truncated 30-minute version of the _Production Diaries Documentary_ , produced by Spielberg regular Laurent Bouzereau. On its own, it's a very effective fly-on-the-wall feature, but compared to the full-length feature on the previous release, it's a little disappointing (especially when one considers that there was enough extra disc space to fit it on). Also included are the following featurettes; _The Effects of Indy_ , which talks about the rather extensive (and controversial) use of CG effects in the film ranging from wire-removal, digital backgrounds replacing matte paintings, to fully CG animals and creatures.The _Adventures In Post Production_ is a quick summary of the final stages of the film's production, from the changes made to elements of the story to the final sound mix, including John Williams' score; it's all glossed over here. _Iconic Props_ takes a look at some of the prop work, including the fan-pleasing cameo from the Ark of the Covenant.Finally, the following featurettes (hangovers from the even earlier 2003 DVD release); take closer looks at specific parts of the saga's production: _The Stunts of Indiana Jones_ takes a look at the work of Vic Armstrong, amongst others, _The Sounds of Indiana Jones_ covers the sound design of Lucasfilm's Ben Burtt, _The Music of Indiana Jones_ is concerned with the origins of that classic theme song (who knew it was two tunes mixed together?) and finally _The Light and Magic of Indiana Jones_ which looks at the pioneering work of the special effects company in the model age.The maligned fourth entry in the saga scrubs up well in 4K, even if the resolution bump can't improve the actual film.### Indiana Jones 4-Movie Collection 4K UHD + Digital| Today| Yesterday| 7 days ago| 30 days ago|  | $63.50| $63.50| $63.50|* Prices last scanned on 9/13/2021 at 2:07 pm CDT - prices may not be accurate, click links above for the latest price.

Rigas and his attorney did not respond to The Post's requests for comments.At the time of publishing, over 400 people had signed the petition against the demolition, according to Change.org.

Thus, with the surgery volume increasing due to people's rising disposable income and surging prevalence of chronic diseases, the demand for surgical simulators is escalating too.   * Growing Geriatric Population: The boom in the elderly population is another major surgical simulation market driver because this population is at a high risk of physical injuries and acute and chronic diseases. Moreover, older people also worry more about their appearance, which is why they are increasingly opting for aesthetic procedures, the skills for which can be enhanced on simulators.The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the surgical simulation market due to the closure of most of the surgery departments around the world.

A Complete Newbie Buys Her First Adult Watch # Watching Movies Matt Damon And Christian Bale Both Wear Heuer Watches In 'Ford V Ferrari'The watches are sweet, though not entirely period-accurate, in our watch-related movie of the week.August 20, 2021_Ford v Ferrari_ (2019) is an immersive movie experience tracking the exploits of renowned car designer Carroll Shelby (played by Matt Damon) and British racer driver Ken Miles (played by Christian Bale) as they play the yin to each other's yang while building a car fit to take on Ferrari in the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race. In the process, they struggle with endless bureaucracy inside the Ford Motor Company \u2013 for whom they are building a car. In line with the times, both characters wear undeniably cool Heuer watches with real racing heritage.Why We're WatchingThe 2021 Le Mans race is upon us this weekend. The Steve McQueen-led film _Le Mans_ (1971) is no doubt a classic, featuring the now iconic Heuer Monaco \u2013 but let's not count out this modern entry. _Ford v Ferrari_ , in most foreign markets, is known by the title _Le Mans '66_. This movie lives and breathes the race, and gives the audience a firsthand look at what it takes to build a car worthy of inclusion \u2013 and one that can compete. It just so happens that the world brought to life by director James Mangold (of _Wolverine_ fame and the upcoming untitled _Indiana Jones 5_ ) gives us some sweet vintage Heuer watches to look at when there isn't high-octane racing.Just a couple of cowboys (Matt Damon and Christian Bale) hanging out. Note the Heuer Carrera ref. 7753 on Damon's wrist. Screengrab courtesy: 20th Century StudiosJust like we saw with Leonardo DiCaprio in _The Wolf of Wall Street_, TAG Heuer played an active role in helping find the right watches for the characters in the film. I made mention of this in a recent appearance on HODINKEE Radio when I said that not all product placement is bad. When brands get actively involved in a film from a historical standpoint, the results are a stronger movie overall, even if the watches aren't 100% accurate to the year. Omega played a prominent role in supplying _First Man_ with period-correct timepieces, as well. In the end, it's great for watch lovers to know that attention was paid all the way down to the wrist.Bale's Ken Miles with his Autavia ref. 2446 on the underside of his wrist. Screengrab courtesy: 20th Century StudiosMatt Damon's cowboy-hat-adorned Carroll Shelby wears a Heuer Carrera, Reference 7753 SN. Now, for all the talk of period accuracy, this one misses the mark by a few years. The film takes place, for the most part, in 1966 but the 7753 did not hit the market until 1970. This is, what the good folks on IMDB would call, a goof \u2013 but not a drastic one by any means. It would be far more egregious for him to have worn a modern Carrera.Similar Heuer Carrera ref. 7753 to the one worn by Matt Damon in _Ford v Ferrari._ Photo: BonhamsStandout features of this watch are its two-register layout with a white dial and black contrasting sub-registers. Damon's Shelby, with his slight southern twang, wears this watch effectively for the entire film.Christian Bale's Ken Miles also sports a Heuer, though his is much harder to see, since he mostly wears it on the underside of his wrist throughout the film. His is the Autavia ref. 2446, also known as the \"Rindt\" (after the famed racer Jochen Rindt). Again we run into a slight historical faux pas in that this particular watch wasn't released until 1968. I would say \"but who's counting?\" But who am I kidding? We all are.Similar Heuer ref. 2446 to the one worn by Christian Bale in _Ford v Ferrari._According to Jeff Stein on _On the Dash_ , period-correct Autavia watches were \"far more rare (and expensive) than later models.\" Looks like 1968 was the next best year. But that doesn't make the black dial, reverse-panda configuration design with it's tachymeter bezel any less cool though. Bale's character obviously found it so cool that he wore it beneath his wrist or the method actor knew the watch was off by a couple years and was doing his best to hide it from the camera.When We're WatchingSince Miles wears his watch on the underside of his wrist throughout the movie \u2013 a clear shot is all but impossible. We get our best view of it in a sequence where both Shelby and Miles are touring Ford's facilities, and being shown the racing engines. Miles, with a very '60s yellow polo, is standing above the Ford engine as it rattles and roars. As a trained driver, he's just taking it all in. Eventually he puts his hand up to his black Ford-branded ear-muffs [00:56:51], and as he does \u2013 we can see the Rindt peeking out from underneath. A brief moment, sure, but a cool one.Screengrab courtesy: 20th Century StudiosAbout midway through the movie, Ford makes a tough call \u2013 informing Shelby that Miles will not be driving a Ford car at Le Mans. He just doesn\u2019t fit the Ford image in their mind. It's Shelby's job to let him know, and Miles doesn't take it well. Needless to say, Ford didn't fare so well with their driver of choice, which gave Shelby leverage to put Miles in the driver's seat for the following year, 1966. In a hilarious scene where Shelby shows up on Miles's front lawn cowboy-hat-in-hand (literally), the two end up throwing hands in a child-like brawl that ends with both on their backs [01:14:53], amid a sea of spilled groceries, drinking Cokes. It's at this moment that Shelby's Carrera ref. 7753 comes into clear view.Screengrab courtesy: 20th Century StudiosFord v Ferrari _(starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale) is directed by James Mangold, with props by John Paul \"J.P.\" Jones.

(Sandra Abma/CBC)The audience for each show will be physically distanced, he added, but will feel closer.\"When the lights go down and the actors get started, it feels like we're all together and it's quite magical,\" said Leno.Outdoor theatre was chased out of parks by the pandemic. Stages went dark, theatre seasons were cancelled, and actors, set directors, costume designers and many other skilled workers lost their jobs.Leno says government funding and the odd online or television gig helped some actors weather the break, but he knows many who left the profession for other jobs.\"We've been on a bit of a forced hiatus for 18 months ... financially, and also just emotionally, it's been a difficult time,\" said Leno.\"This is what people dedicate their lives toward doing and spend a lot of time working on their craft and perfecting, and to be away from that for so long, I've seen it really hurt artists.\"Maryse Fernandes plays a range of Shakespearean characters in Love From Afar, including Juliet and Hamlet. (Sandra Abma/CBC)Local actor Maryse Fernandes tackles a range of Shakespeare's best loved characters in Love from Afar, including the doomed Juliet and the tragic Hamlet. She says her favourite part is playing the stone wall that acts as a go-between to the bewitched lovers in A Midsummer Night's Dream.Fernandes found work last year in productions over Zoom and voicing audio books, but she's missed the thrill of performing before a live audience.\"I hadn't realized it was going to hurt so much,\" said Fernandes.\"The energy on stage is always different depending who is in our audience. To have that live audience again is going to be spectacular.\"In the fall of 2020, A Company of Fools performed outside long-term care homes for seniors under pandemic lockdown. (submitted by A Company of Fools)The Company of Fools will perform in seven locations in Ottawa and just outside the city on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays between Sept. 2 and 25 with a capacity of 100 for each show.The group also plans to put on free shows for clients of non-profit facilities serving vulnerable populations.The pandemic has suspended the long-held tradition of passing the hat through the audience at the end of the performance, so tickets must be purchased in advance. They are now on sale but there was only availability for two evening shows in rural areas as of Saturday morning.Sandra Abma is a veteran CBC arts journalist.

Just high level for folks who've never heard of your company, what is PLBY Group?**Kohn:** Yeah, PLBY Group is a holding company. Our largest brand is Playboy. I think most people have heard about that. The products are sold in 180 countries, driving over $3 billion of consumer spend. Probably one of the top three or four most recognized brands in the world.But we're a holding company, all focused on pleasure and leisure in people's lives. In addition to Playboy, we own Yandy, which is an e-commerce site selling lingerie in the United States, Lovers, which is a sexual wellness chain of stores and digital footprint. Then, we just recently acquired Honey Birdette. Really excited by it, one of the top lingerie brands, in our opinion, in the world. Formerly based out of Australia, the business is growing 40%, $80 million of revenue this year. Just entering in a large way, the United States and then other Western markets in Europe.**Sciple:** Yeah, absolutely. Ben, I mentioned off the top, Playboy returning public through this transaction earlier this year, now you have this big portfolio of brands. You've been involved with the company since it was taken private back in 2011. Why now all these transactions? Yandy was a 2020 transaction, those other two companies. You mentioned 2021. Why now, all of a sudden, this activity is coming back public? All that stuff.**Kohn:** Maybe it helps to reset what the company was and what the company is today. When we took the company private, I like to take private transactions in 2011, a long time ago. It was a media business at the end of the day. That's what Hef cared about; he cared about the magazine. In fact, when you go back and look at the merger agreement, which was publicly filed, there are two things that he wanted when we took the company private. He wanted to run the magazine until he died, and he wanted to live in the mansion until he died.You're looking at the evolution of the business till about 2017, when I took over as CEO. It was a media business, which generated the bulk of the revenue, and then it was a licensing business. They offset the media losses by licensing out the masthead or the Playboy trademarks in consumer products. What we pivoted to and because I don't believe that you can really be a media business by definition, selling advertising if you're trying to be a brand, and I always viewed this company as the original lifestyle brand.The first product this company ever made was a pair of cuff links. It had casinos, it had hotels, it had a whole host of things. That doesn't sound like a media company; that sounds like a lifestyle brand. The focus was really to shut down or pivot the company away from media, which I thought would continue to be challenged moving forward. Especially in some of the areas, we were in with the proliferation of the Internet. And really focused the company back on its roots as a lifestyle brand, and all-around consumer products in digital experiences, and that's what we've done.When you look at the business today, it's a very different business than when I took over back in '17. This is a business today, the large majority of revenues, 90-plus percent, come from consumer products. I think we're just getting started. We're also in the process of pivoting or changing the model from licensing to that of owned and operated. I think there's been a shift in how consumers buy D2C or e-commerce.Therefore, licensing is a less efficient model for that, and we can own a lot more of the spend. That $3 billion of consumer spend, the challenge with licensing is you're getting pennies on the dollar for that, $0.02, $0.03 on the dollar for that. If we pivot and we own that, not only can I drive the lifetime value of the customer up and the average order size because I can tell you more products, but I can drive my revenue up. When you look at that, there could be a 20x increasing revenue just if you model it out and actually an increase in EBITDA by 5 or 6 times as well.**Sciple:** You can just recapture some of that spend. There's lots of different directions I wanted to go off here. Maybe let's stick with Playboy here. You talked about this transition the company has gone through. I think on the call, you said historically, Playboy is the content site, now it's a shopping site. Talk about the progress you've made along that and where Playboy fits into this overall family of brands that you've developed over the past year and half or so.**Kohn:** I think Playboy is the hero of the brand at the end of the day. It is one of the top three or four largest brands in the world. What's so interesting about Playboy is Playboy can go high and it can go low, in price points to consumers. It can be mass, it can be masstige, or premium, and it can be luxury, and there's a history of that. Honey Birdette is a luxury brand, it's a very high price point lingerie business that is obviously experiencing phenomenal growth and I think will be a billion-dollar business for us. Then Yandy and Lovers tend to be more mass-market overall.I think we have a really interesting portfolio of brands, and what we'll end up doing long-term with Lovers and Yandy is we're working on right now, creating a subbrand and leveraging that Playboy masthead to turn those businesses into more private label products. But the growth for the company is around consumer products and digital experiences. When I think about an ecosystem that couples both virtual goods with physical goods, I get really excited because that allows us, long term, to not only drive the current revenue but superior margins as well.**Sciple:** When you talk about the shift to shopping customers, selling consumer products, sexual wellness, all those things, it sounds like a different type of customer than would have historically been the subscriber to the magazine, that sort of thing. Maybe gender is different, demographically different. How do you think about your customer today versus what it may have been in the past?**Kohn:** Yeah. When I took over, we were probably 95% male-female. What we announced in the first quarter of this year was that 55% of our customers were women, which is great. We have 75% of our workforce actually at Playboy today are women. It's great to see that. Very different than when we took over. The numbers we announced yesterday, I'll just give you this. Our traffic in the second quarter only grew about 9.6%. But what's so interesting is that our shopping customers grew 70%. We've made this transition of our audience to that of coming to us for content to now that of coming to us for product. I think that will continue to evolve and accelerate moving forward.**Sciple:** Yeah, one of the things you talked about on the call I wanted to drive into a little bit more is how you're doing that from a marketing point of view. You talked about focusing on influencer marketing and a quick turn. Talk about your marketing strategy and what you're doing to try to make that, I guess, mind shift among your customers that you're trying to capture.**Kohn:** We benefit because the brand is extremely popular and hot on Gen Z and with Gen Z, and I think it really relates to a lot of the causes that we have fought for, for the last 70 years of the company's history: equality, LGBTQ+ rights, civil rights, etc. This company has been at the forefront advocating for equality and for free speech. When you think about that, we have a number of influencers.I hear all the time about the number of people on TikTok just organically wearing this brand. We saw this hoodie challenge develop organically. A few weeks ago, we got into it, and then there's influencers, Playmates, the former adult stars, the Bretman Rocks, and others that we work with. We launched a T-shirt with Bretman Rock in June, geared around pride. It's sold out before he was even able to post on his Instagram and his social media all that, and so we have many of those coming.We have a subbrand called Playboy Labs, which is really our collab. We've done things with Steve Aoki and others in the past. You'll start to see a more consistent level of product drops with influencers moving forward. But what we benefited from and what is so interesting about HB or Honey Birdette as well is a lot of this is organic. It's people that are going out and buying the product and wanting to wear the products.**Sciple:** You talked about that hoodie, that thing that popped up on TikTok. Are you implementing a print-on-demand-type model? How are you doing these quick turnarounds whenever you see things emerging on social media or what have you?**Kohn:** It's a combination of both print on demand and then our basics that we have in stock all the time, and that is continuing to evolve your report in a great digital e-commerce team. They've only been on the job for really three to four months now. But people who have run big businesses, and so it's a combination of both. And then we'll continue to do at playboy.com, over the coming months we will continue to evolve the product offerings we have. More of a combination of both drop culture, but with everyday-on products, really geared around lifestyle, and the four categories we've talked about before, which is apparel and accessories, sexual wellness, gaming and lifestyle, which are home goods and other things, and then beauty and grooming category.We have a very successful fragrance business in Europe. We just brought it to the United States. That's a licensing deal, but we're now developing our own beauty and cosmetics line, which is right now in the formulation and design phase, and that will be launched next year.**Sciple:** You talked about some of these brands moving into the lingerie market, really particularly aggressively the Honey Birdette acquisition. I want to talk about what's going on in space right now. You've seen Victoria's Secret pull away from its Angels program, really run away from the more, I guess, overtly sexual advertising. Look at Honey Birdette, very the other side, the other side of that coin. So what do you make of what's going on in the market and why your approach during the opposite of what some established players are doing has some room for success?**Kohn:** I wouldn't say that we're going opposite. I think that without getting into disparaging Victoria's Secret, they've lost their place in the market. It's a highly fragmented market. There is a way to be sexy without objectifying. I think if you look at what's happened to Playboy and what the content team, the marketing team have done over the previous three years, look at the diversity in talent that we work with. It's a very different Playboy than it was back in the Hef days. I think it really speaks to what's happening in society overall.Honey Birdette, obviously very sexy lingerie, comes out of Australia. Eloise, who's the founder of the company, has just moved to the United States. Obviously in Australia, your diversity in talent that you work with is different than what it can be in Europe and in the United States, and so I think you'll continue to see it, but again we're not scared of sexy. I think it's a question of doing it in the right way that's not objectifying and that's really owning your own sexuality.What's so great about both companies together. Honey Birdette is almost 100% female. It's a company founded by women for women, and Playboy, when you look at it today, 75% of our workforce -- and this is before the Honey Birdette acquisition -- are made up of women.**Sciple:** Absolutely. One of the things I wanted to talk about, we've talked a lot about private label trend of doing direct-to-consumer at this, this growth area for the business, one thing you talked about on the call is really significantly increased your long-term revenue margin rate from $300 million by 2025 to $600 million, so I'd see that obviously great to see that number increase so much.On the other side of this is why is it surprising you so much of the growth that you're seeing, what was the biggest surprise that took place to see this huge increase in your guidance?**Kohn:** The guidance we gave, $300 million and $600 million after being public for six months, really speaks to the stuff that we have in our pipeline today, in the pieces that we've assembled with the acquisitions that we've made, so we'll be launching, and we talked about this yesterday on our earnings call, Playboy or Playmate Lingerie. Moving forward, leveraging the Honey Birdette skill design team and sourcing Titan team.We just have a lot more arrows in our quiver moving forward as we made that transition from a licensing business to that which had been owned and operated.Look, I think there's a lot of upside to that number. When you look at it, that number is based on a 20% growth on D2C and the single-digit growth in the licensing business, and that doesn't include if we decide to take back more categories, which we have the option to do, that are already licensed out, and it doesn't include other acquisitions that we might make in the future.I feel very good about where we sit. I think the growth prospects for the business today are actually greater than we were in public. We just have to say extremely focused as a team, and then on top of that, some of the digital revenue streams that will be adding here over the next six months to a year, geared around membership and NFTs and blockchain, I think long term will allow us actually accelerate our growth and actually enhance our margins.**Sciple:** Yeah, so I want to talk about some of the new product offerings. Why are you so excited about NFTs, if you view this as a fad or something that really has a lot of staying power, and if so, why?**Kohn:** Look, I think NFTs are getting drilled through multiple different cycles. I don't think it's a fad; I think it's here to stay. You have to think about it as the intersection of content and community, and so you look at what Topshop has done, it's really really interesting. We have one of the most valuable archives in my opinion, we have 10 million pieces in our archive. We have a 5,000-piece collection, we have unbelievable influencers that we work with that have huge audiences and adult stars and Playmates, etc. We can bring this together in a cohesive ecosystem.NFTs, we've talked about this yesterday, the dial-ups era of the internet right now. But it's really gaining notice as well, and I think this brand, of all brands I can think of, works so well at that intersection of digital and physical. We can host a live Halloween party in Las Vegas, and we can couple that with a virtual party online where you would have to be a member to attend. We can sell you virtual goods for your avatar coming to our party, and we can sell you physical goods as well.This brand is really, really well positioned as consumers want more and more lifestyle-driven offerings, but it doesn't have to be physical offerings, in place it can be virtual offerings as well. Look what Travis Scott did on _Fortnite_ , a year-ago with that concert where he had 27+ million people tune into it. That is the future. I think NFTs are really leading to the decentral of the artists' community.**Sciple:** You mentioned that collision between community and content. One area that makes sense to me is you have people that are very engaged in this space, and this is an area where you can market to them and get paid to do so. How do you think this is just a way to get exposure to this younger audience?**Kohn:** Well, look, I think we have exposure to the younger audience, but it's the people that we work with, and I think it's also that when you look at younger people, they tell you they are obviously younger than I am. It's not about what's hanging on your wall, it's about what's in your digital wallet. You look at social media in general, you look at Snapshot, Instagram, etc., why is the camera taking over? Well, because there's value in what you're associated with. There's value in what you're posting online because it defines you to a much larger community.When I grew up, it was my 10 friends or 15 friends; that was your community. Today, you look at young people, their communities are huge, and they have thousands of followers because digital allows you to do that.I think we have some of the most iconic IP in the world. This is 70 years of Americana, but more importantly, it's also the influencers that we work with today, and creating this cohesive ecosystem I think it will not only drive our digital sales but our physical sales as well.**Sciple:** You mentioned earlier this revenue guidance doesn't account for future acquisitions, it's all organic that you're trying to project into the future. But obviously, you have a background in private equity, there's folks on your management team from **Match Group** , **IAC**. These are folks who have done deals in the past. As you're looking for potential acquisitions or to invest capital to bring assets back in-house that are licensed out, what are you looking for? What are the criteria that they jump out to you as \"this is something I want to invest in\"?**Kohn:** Look, it's putting the pieces together that allow us to accelerate growth. We've done that with the acquisitions to date. The E&E team is unbelievable at design and sourcing. That expedited and accelerated our growth or launch of Playboy Lingerie by a big margin. Not only that, but they have designs that have never come out of Australia that we can leverage moving forward.Moving forward for other acquisitions, we're open to it. We have $85+ million of cash on our balance sheet today. I would see things in the digital world coming into light moving forward as we look to build out that ecosystem. But again, we have all the pieces we need to achieve the numbers that we've put out there today.But I think there's ways to accelerate that. There's ways to move some of our licensing partners to JV partners, where we can book that revenue and run that e-com where we can grow our consumer base even more, which should lead to acceleration of revenue because the larger base I have the more LTV I can drive a lifetime value of that customer or I can drive long term.**Sciple:** Go ahead, Ben. Sorry, finish.**Kohn:** Just speaking to Lance and the rest of the team, what's so exciting for me is I love to surround myself with people that are much smarter than I am. The level of talent that we have brought in and are starting to continue in our pipeline is just awesome to see. That's what's so exciting about going public. Not only now do we have the capital to do what we needed to do to transform this business, but the level of talent we're getting is night and day from where the company was a few years ago.**Sciple:** Ben, we've talked a lot about the direct-to-consumer business. You mentioned opportunities to transition these licensing parts of the business over to maybe joint ventures, and that introduces China outside of the U.S. Very different brand in China than it is in the U.S, a different business model as well when you look at licensing. Just talk about compare and contrast this China business, international business to what you're building here in North America right now.**Kohn:** China is its own ecosystem, OK. They've never really seen the magazine or let me say this, they've never seen it legally in China. The company went to China 20+ years ago, and it was really Americana at the time and has really become almost an own Chinese business or China business within China. It's largely menswear today. It is all licensing. We have three primary licensees and then three what I would say are smaller licensees in China.But what's so interesting about China is the consumer demand for the brand. Last year, we did $1 billion of e-commerce revenue in China, or let me say that our partners did $1 billion of e-commerce revenue.When you think long term about how you aggregate revenue, I think there's a way to change that business model. Now, it's not going to happen overnight. These are partners that have been long-standing partners of the company for 15+ years, and we want to make sure that we include them in this, but they're manufacturers as well. I think there's a way to actually aggregate that e-commerce revenue long term.The business is growing in China. We're just entering the women's category. We just did a kids deal. India is a huge growth opportunity for us. We'll do India, learning from the mistakes that the company made in China over the years and the way we're structuring those deals. We've signed a deal to open Playboy beer gardens here, we've signed a deal with the gaming partner to launch Playboy Rummy in 2022 in India.We just signed last night a deal to relicense our U.S. iGaming rights. I can't tell you who the partner is yet but I am very excited by that and especially the growth and iGaming in the United States moving forward. But China, I think, can double in size over time, and I think we can change the business model in China over time as well.**Sciple:** I want to talk about Playboy Kids just because that just blows my mind that there's a Playboy Kids line. What Playboy Kids products are out there? No. 2, is Playboy Kids going to leave China? What's the deal there?**Kohn:** I don't know if we'll leave China. I'll tell you a funny story. Back when all of us could travel and life was normal, I was on the Bund in Shanghai in a car coming in from the airport with my head of licensing. Coming across the street at the stoplight was a little kid wearing a Playboy sweatshirt. I didn't think we have Playboy Kids at the time. He needed to go relieve himself on the tree on the Bund side of things. I looked and said, \"Wait, do we have a licensing deal for Playboy Kids?\" He says, \"No, that's all counterfeit.\"One of our licensing partners thought there was a huge opportunity for Playboy Kids. We're going to open their first store. They're obviously doing e-com but open physical store in Shanghai this year, and it's an opportunity.Again, the brand is very different over there than it is here. Over there it's been a fashion brand. That's what it's been for 20+ years. Obviously, in the United States, you have the history of the media and the magazine, which make a difference. I don't see Playboy Kids coming to the United States, but what I will say is very encouraged by the Gen Z audience that we do have and them loving to wear the brand.**Sciple:** Maybe the last couple of questions. You mentioned the gaming side of the business. You've talked about doing more in-person experiences, such as the Playboy Plane. What should we be looking for as far as those types of activities?**Kohn:** The paint job on the plane looks amazing. We're going to be using it for our influencer activation coupled with the big Bunny launch. We just had a great live experience in partnership with Tau Group last week in Vegas for our Midsummer Night's Dream party. You should expect to see more live experiences coupled with virtual experiences moving forward, all geared to what we've talked about with membership. But I think this brand is best when people can experience it, whether that be physical or virtual, and I think that would be part of our strategy moving forward.**Sciple:** Who do you say is your biggest competitor?**Kohn:** This is one of the hardest things to answer. There's competitors in the product categories that we're in. Would you say in lingerie **Victoria's Secret** is a competitor? Sure. It's a huge business. So is La Perla, so is Agent Provocateur, etc. But as a brand, I can't think of another brand that is a competitor to us for everything that we play in.On the product side, yes, but this brand is so unique, and this is why I think this brand is really priceless and worth multiples of our market cap today. Give me another brand that sells products in 180 countries that generates over $3 billion today in spending that's valued where we are. I just can't think of one. Especially for one that can play in the number of categories that we can play in. From spirits to gaming to hospitality to clothing, I just can't think of that.Now, as a team, we have to be really, really careful, and we have to stay extremely focused on our priorities and making sure that we deliver and execute on what's in front of us. But the roadmap long-term really gives us endless growth possibilities.**Sciple:** Since there's no direct comparison as a brand, what's a brand that you admire, whether it's a competitor or not, that maybe you think Playboy should be included in the same sentence as this brand?**Kohn:** Well, I think so highly of **Nike**. What Nike has done in their transition as a business model is unbelievable. I even go back to **Ralph Lauren** , and say what Ralph did, Ralph was a business that was a little dated. It's become very relevant. They have live experiences in the Polo restaurants, etc.But more importantly, it was a business that had been licensed out. They took all that back in-house over a multiyear period, and look at our e-commerce business today. Alice Delahunt has done just an unbelievable job there on e-com. She had been at **Burberry**. But again, I think Nike is the pinnacle in what they've been able to do. I would love one day to be included in the same sentence, but that's a pretty high aspiration.**Sciple:** Hey, maybe you're in the running with them on Instagram followers or something like that. You can compete on at least one of those fronts.Maybe the last question for you. If we look out five years from now, what's the biggest change that this business has undergone, and what are you most excited about?**Kohn:** You look out five years, I think it's just continued to execute on what we've outlined already. I think that change from a media company to a valuable lifestyle brand is the single biggest change. I'm really excited by this combination of virtual and physical coming together in this community, and I think this is a brand that has historically had membership. This is a brand that has historically had a really vast community.I think when I look at the influencers that we work with coupled with the products, long-term, I want to have a significant portion of our revenue coming from recurring revenue streams like we have with our licensing business, which is a quasi-SaaS business at the end of the day. I think this brand has the possibility to do all of it. We just have to, again, stay focused as a company and that's the biggest thing for our team right now.**Sciple:** Get that dollar share in the market to match the mind share among consumers.Ben, I'm so excited to continue to follow the work you're doing. Thanks so much for spending time with us, and hope we can talk to you again soon.**Kohn:** This is great. I appreciate it.

Created by couple Tyson and Audy Leavitt, Charmed Resorts is an addition to the family's luxury playhouse company that centers on the idea of bringing the brand to life in a more affordable way for families.Charmed Playhouses began six years ago when Tyson started making high-end children's backyard playhouses with a clientele list that includes celebrities like Steph Curry and Ali Landry. They even had their own TLC show called **Playhouse Masters**! With everything from castles to pirate ships and treehouses \u2014 and some price tags boasting around half a million dollars \u2014 the popularity of the brand incentivized the family to open a resort where more families could enjoy the playhouses, and enjoy them on an even grander scale. \"We really wanted our business to become more accessible to more people, like people of all budgets, and we actually couldn't even get back to all the people who wanted us to build them playhouses, so we decided to start Charmed Resorts,\" Audy told POPSUGAR.> \"We would love for as many people to come and get away from the cares of the world and kind of escape into a storybook setting.\"Located in the Blairmore area of Alberta, Canada, the resort currently has four cottages that are available to rent, starting at $285 to $330 a night, with one that's the most popular (and perhaps most magical) of the bunch. Rapunzel's Cottage is a whimsical escape that's just as dreamy as it sounds. \"Everyone likes Rapunzel the best,\" Audy said, laughing, and it's easy to see why! Inspired by one of the fairy tales she and her husband grew up reading, this cottage pushes the boundaries of imagination. With a picturesque design, the rental is cute and quaint enough to charm anyone. Complete with interior details picked out by the Leavitts, Rapunzel's Cottage looks as if it came to life from the lines of the storybook itself. With enough room to sleep four adults and two children, the $330-a-night space is ideal for family getaways. Inside features nods to the princess with fairy-tale-inspired decor and a rustic woodland vibe that fits its woodsy setting, while the outside has abarbecue, fire pit, picnic table, _and_ swing. It's the perfect place to reset, relax, and reimagine your destiny.As for the rest of the resort, the family plan on building more cottages throughout the years. \"My husband's dream is to have about 15 to 20 cottages at the resort we're currently at, and then open a resort somewhere else,\" Audy said. \"His dream is to have Charmed Resorts spotted all throughout the world.\" With the success the resort saw this summer, this dream is not far off from becoming a reality. The upcoming cottages will feature ideas from guests, favorites from fans on social media, and inspiration from those closest to the family. From fairy tales to Shakespearean plays (there's a new **A Midsummer Night's Dream** -themed cottage!), the family have only just begun creating magic. \"We would love for as many people to come and get away from the cares of the world and kind of escape into a storybook setting,\" Audy said.You can book Rapunzel's Cottage here, and keep reading to get a peek inside.In News We Needed, a Castle in Italy Has Braille Etched in the Railing That Describes the ViewPrevious Next __Start Slideshow __Travel InspirationDisneyTravelFamily VacationDisney PrincessesTikTok Just Proved That This Town in Michigan Has One of the Best Halloween Villages to Visitby  Lauren Harano  5 days agoThe Latest Viral TikTok Product?

(Kevin N. Hume/The Examiner)## From gondolas to office dogs, a snapshot of San Francisco's tech scene this weekEditor's note: _This week, we 're launching a new column called Screenshots, in which Senior Tech Reporter Jeff Elder reports on the comings and goings of S.F.'s biggest industry. Stay tuned as we keep tabs on all things tech._If you're wondering when -- if ever -- The City's downtown will celebrate a grand reopening, an insider tells us the lighting of **Salesforce Tower** for the holidays in mid-November may be tied to events and promotions in the Financial District, SoMa and along the Embarcadero. Talks with City Hall are happening now, the source tells us, and the delta variant's presence is a key factor\u2026The gondola that zips riders from Mission Street up to **Salesforce Park** in a mere 60 seconds (more Slow and Luxurious than Fast and Furious) was quietly switched on a month ago. Did you know? A mammoth tooth was found on the park site that's about the size and shape of **Buster Posey** 's catcher's mitt. Some plant species in the park have been around since the time of the dinosaurs. So no wonder the gondola is so slow. It's a bit of a time machine\u2026Speaking of reopening, the **La Fromagerie** location on 100 First St. -- ringed by tech companies -- was again serving brie and croissants on Thursday for the first time in more than a year. Co-owner **Thomas Choffel** , astutely aware of tech workers' love for snacks, sent emails to **Okta** , **Salesforce** and other companies offering a free macaron (cookie) with any salad or sandwich order. He says (in his charming French accent) that tech workers are 100% of that location's business, and he's opening with a new license because \"tech workers need happy hours again.\" I know a few who agree\u2026La Fromagerie owner Thomas Choffel has reopened the SoMa shop at First and Mission streets near Salesforce and Okta, which now features a wine to-go license for techies' happy hours. (Jeff Elder/The Examiner)Down on the Peninsula, **Tom Siebel** 's **C3.ai** remains one of the only tech companies we know of to be completely back in the office. A C3 source says several hundred of the AI company's employees come into its glass-walled Redwood Shores offices each weekday and work, masks optional\u2026More Peninsula tech news you didn't know: **Facebook** plans to build a bridge across Bayfront Expressway to a park open to the public this fall, a source familiar with the projects tells me\u2026San Mateo database startup **Neo4j** -- which landed a massive $340 million funding round in July -- has found a fun way to connect the home office to employees in London and Sweden. San Mateo biz dev manager **Keoni Gaspar** teaches a mixology class on Zoom. Sounds like a good way to toast that huge funding raise -- and proof that some techies do need to enjoy happy hours together again\u2026Last week former President **Donald Trump** -- via nine attorneys -- hit Twitter CEO **Jack Dorsey** with a summons to respond to a lawsuit that says losing access to his accounts has made it considerably more difficult for the plaintiff to \"lay the groundwork for his own potential campaign for the 2024 Republican Party nomination for President of the United States\"\u2026This week, the self-driving wunder-company **Waymo** kicked off its tester program in The City, and the company says anyone can sign up for the program and help by downloading the Waymo One app. The first tester took a ride to the **Stonestown Galleria** mall. Waymo says its tester cars are driving 100,000 miles a week around The City. That's a lotta trips to the mall\u2026Thursday was International Dog Day, and **Stephanie Mangold** shipped us a pic of her office corgi **Coco Bean** addressing the issue of phishing -- or goldfishing, anyway. Stephanie works at the San Francisco cybersecurity insurance startup **Coalition** , located in **Levi 's Plaza** near the Embarcadero. Did you know their CEO **Josh Motta** was Microsoft's youngest-ever employee? He was an intern at 15\u2026Coco Bean of San Francisco cybersecurity startup Coalition is the first Screenshots tech office dog.

She was 90.Her death was announced by her longtime associate and friend Kristen Luciani.Elizabeth Ireland McCann -- known throughout the Broadway community simply as Liz -- started her career in theater as a production assistant and manager with Proscenium Productions at the Cherry Lane Theatre in the 1950s. In 1955, the company would be the first Off Broadway theater to win a Special Tony Award for its seminal productions of _The Way of the World_ and _Thieves ' Carnival._###  Showbiz & Media Figures We've Lost In 2021 - Photo GalleryFollowing a series of short-term theater jobs, McCann, who had acted in plays during her student years at Manhattanville College, completed a law degree at Fordham University. She later earned a Master's in English Literature at Columbia University, with the intention of becoming a drama teacher.By 1967, McCann had moved on to Broadway, where she was hired as Managing Director by theater owner James Nederlander. Soon, she and business partner Nelle Nugent created the general management and production company McCann & Nugent.What followed for McCann & Nugent was a remarkable string of Tony Award-winning productions: _Dracula_ (1979), _The Elephant Man_ (1979), _Morning 's at Seven_ (1980), _Amadeus_ (1980) and _The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby_ (1981). McCann & Nugent's other Broadway productions include _Night and Day_ (starring Maggie Smith), _Piaf, Rose_ (starring Glenda Jackson and Jessica Tandy), _Leader of the Pack, The Dresser, Mass Appeal, Good, The Glass Menagerie_ (starring Jessica Tandy and Amanda Plummer) and the Royal Shakespeare Company's _All 's Well That End's Well_, along with _Much Ado About Nothing_ and _Cyrano de Bergerac_ starring Derek Jacobi.As General Managers, McCann & Nugent managed the Broadway productions of _The Gin Game_ with Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, _Tintypes, Crimes of the Heart, 'night Mother _and _Tango Argentino,_ along with _The Robber Bridegroom, Otherwise Engaged_ and _Comedy with Music_ by Victor Borge.In partnership with other producers, McCann earned four more Tony Awards for _The Goat_ by Edward Albee, _Copenhagen, A View From the Bridge_ and the revival of _Hair_. She was also a producer of _Les Liaisons Dangereuses, A Delicate Balance, Passing Strange, My Fat Friend_ and _Shakespeare for My Father_ (the latter two starring Lynn Redgrave), _Nick & Nora, Orpheus Descending_ starring Vanessa Redgrave and _A Midsummer Night 's Dream._McCann also produced extensively Off-Broadway, including _The Lady with the Clarinet_ and _Painting Churches,_ both produced with Nugent. She served as Executive Producer of the Tony Awards for several years and was General Manager of the Big Apple Circus.Born on Manhattan's West Side, McCann would, in 1993, begin what would be the most rewarding collaboration of her later years with the production of Edward Albee's Pulitzer Prize-winning _Three Tall Women_. The two reunited with the 2002 Tony Award-winning _The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?_ and the 2005 revival of _Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?_ starring Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, and the Off-Broadway hits _The Play About the Baby_ and _Beckett/Albee.  _Having partnered with Daryl Roth on the Albee productions, the two co-produced Paula Vogel's play _Indecent_ on Broadway in 2018 and most recently joined Robert Fox in producing Martin McDonagh's _Hangmen_ , which closed prior to opening on Broadway due to the Covid pandemic shutdown.Funeral arrangements are being made.

That was a time when I was fully alive, when I fully became myself. But I lost my smile a little when I performed in the Footlights revue of 1962.I didn't like the Footlights boys and they really didn't like me. They made that obvious.When I say 'they', I refer to a most distinguished group: John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Bill Oddie, Humphrey Barclay (later Head of Comedy at LWT), Tony Hendra and Tim Brooke-Taylor.Not my heroes: Miriam\u2019s fellow Cambridge undergraduates and future Pythons John Cleese and Graham Chapman, with Aimi MacDonald and, front left, Tim Brooke-Taylor and, right, Marty FeldmanThe only girl in the show, I was a pert little madam and thought I was as good as they were \u2014 and they didn't.My perception was that they thought I was a jumped-up, pushy, overconfident, fat little Jew. But I was funny, and they didn't like it.If you think about it, the Monty Python shows didn't feature funny women, only the occasional dolly bird. And I certainly wasn't that.Their attitudes towards women stemmed from the minor public schools most of them had attended. At that time, and the whole time I was at Cambridge, a woman could not be a member of the Footlights Club. Girls were not welcome: we attended only as guests. These chaps wanted to sleep with women, not compete with them. I was neither decorative nor bedworthy, and they found me unbearable.The problem was exacerbated by my excellent notices, which were resented. They acknowledged each other's cleverness, but only just, and there was considerable class antagonism. David Frost was looked down on, for example, because he was merely a middle-class lad from Gillingham, and they were not happy when Clive James arrived during the Sixties.His brilliance was unstoppable but they disparaged his Australian roots. It was like water off a duck's back with Clive; he had no respect for any of them. And they quickly changed their minds about his acceptability.Cambridge was a competitive place; in Footlights, that became toxic. It was the first time in my life that I experienced that sort of competition. Someone decided I was not to be spoken to offstage: I would go on, do my bits, then the minute I stood in the wings, I was ignored; silence and cold stares.### Slow, searching \u2014 my best male kissI didn't have sexual intercourse at Cambridge, partly because my parents told me I mustn't and also because I didn't know until I was 27 that I was gay (we called it 'queer').However, it was imperative to have a boyfriend, so I spent a very enjoyable year as an 'item' with David Bree, an engineering student who worked backstage at the university's theatre and said he fell in love with me from his lighting box high in the eaves.When I came on stage, he didn't look at anyone else. He didn't see all the things that I think of when I think of myself; he didn't think I was fat; he saw someone he really fancied. He thought: 'That girl's got oomph!'David's kissing technique was excellent. Only Bob Monkhouse, with whom I later acted on television, surpassed his osculatory skill.Bob's was the best male kiss I think I've ever had \u2014 slow, searching, not slurpy. I thought, if I was straight, I would go for Bob. He was interested in people \u2014 wise, kind, funny, generous, all the things you hope a star will be. He is one of my heroes.In total contrast I name Terry Scott, who was the nastiest person I have ever worked with. How the divine June Whitfield put up with him, I cannot imagine.He was horrid to the chorus girls, tried to grope and kiss them and if they wouldn't play, he rubbished them publicly. Of course, he would have behaved himself with June.Bob's was the best male kiss I think I've ever had \u2014 slow, searching, not slurpy. I thought, if I was straight, I would go for BobDuring the entire run of that 1962 revue, directed by Trevor Nunn, they treated me as if I were invisible and did not speak to me at all. Initially, I had no idea why. I was 19 and it was painful. I used to go back to my room in Newnham College and weep.My dislike of that whole, largely male world of comedy has never left me. I feel awkward, admitting to such bitterness \u2014 it seems absurd, I should have got over it. But I haven't. The treatment I received from those Footlights boys was diminishing, pointed and vicious. On reflection, it is they who diminished themselves.I admire the creation of Monty Python and The Goodies and I think they were men of genius, but they were not gentlemen.John Cleese, Bill Oddie and Graham Chapman were total s***s \u2014 and they have never apologised. The only one who did was the late Tim Brooke-Taylor. All the perpetrators went into light entertainment and I went into drama, so thankfully our paths were seldom to cross. But nearly 60 years later I have not forgotten.Some are born comic, some achieve comedy, some have comedy thrust upon them. I am definitely in that third camp. There is something about my face and body that makes people laugh. I've always known that. It's professionally useful, socially perhaps a bit limiting, but I'm asked to dinner parties because of it and I'm not going to moan about looking different.I'd assumed comedy was not for me after the nastiness of Footlights but I have ended up working with many of the non-Cambridge-educated greats of comedy (including Kenneth Williams and Ken Dodd).### Day I made history on University ChallengeMy TV career began even before I left Cambridge, in what would later be seen as my trademark shocking style.In 1963, I was part of the team representing Newnham College in the debut series of Granada TV's University Challenge, presented by Bamber Gascoigne.When I couldn't deliver an answer to something that was on the tip of my tongue, in frustration I swore loudly and we lost the point.It was beeped out of the actual transmission \u2014 but my claim is still staked to be the first person ever to swear on national television.I was certainly the first woman to do so. I met Bamber again last year and he acknowledged that my 'F*** it!' has resounded in his memory for almost 60 years now.In 1963, I was part of the team representing Newnham College in the debut series of Granada TV's University Challenge, presented by Bamber GascoigneIn 1982, I got the call to be a part of Blackadder, playing the ugly Spanish infanta in the fourth episode, The Queen Of Spain's Beard. Although I didn't know many of the other cast members personally, I instantly liked Rowan Atkinson, who played Edmund Blackadder.The thing that fascinated me most was his nervousness. His stammer is not evident now but he definitely had a faltering delivery back then, and it used to infuriate him. He was never nasty to anybody else, but he just couldn't bear it when he made mistakes and would get himself into a frenzy. It was painful to see; his face would contort with rage.I later went to the first night of his one-man show on Broadway, which was a disaster. It was actually brilliant but I could feel that it wasn't going down well with the audience, who just couldn't understand his humour, and I knew he'd be terribly disappointed.After the first-night party, everybody went to Sardi's, a nearby celebrity restaurant. Rowan was already well-known for Blackadder \u2014 the place was packed. Then the reviews came out and they were bad.And all the people at the party just drifted away \u2014 one minute the room was full of babble and a throng of merrymakers, the next minute there were only about six people left, and I was one of them.It was a chilly experience because America does not like, cannot deal with and is afraid of failure. Rowan has never been a failure since but he was that night. I think it was the audience who failed him.It was an honour to be in Blackadder. I was in it in three extreme incarnations: as a Spanish Infanta, as Queen Victoria and as my favourite, Lady Whiteadder, the fanatical Puritan. She gave me flashbacks to my caricatures of the more ridiculous teachers at school.In the early Seventies I got my first voice job, playing a character called 'Sexy Sonia' on a porn tape sold by the Ann Summers sex shop.I wasn't entirely comfortable with the pornography aspect \u2014 Daddy already felt that being an actress was akin to prostitution. So I rang up the shop and asked, 'This is voice only, isn't it? We're definitely not on camera, are we?' The woman reassured me that it was only an audiotape.The script had no redeeming features and so much panting and gasping that I had a bad headache by the end of the recording. Truly, one climax is much like another, but I was having to delve into my sub-conscious to achieve the variety I felt was expected.After all, at least if you have real sex, you have some fulfilment. My only fulfilment was the 300 quid I was paid.But I wasn't complaining: that was a big pay cheque for those days. Although I got no royalties, my commercial instincts came to the fore when the tape was on sale and I wanted to find out how it was doing.So I went into Ann Summers (the shop was full of browsing men, all deliberately avoiding eye contact) and said loudly to the chap behind the counter, 'Oh, hello, I wonder if you could help me. I'm 'Sexy Sonia' and I wondered how I was selling.'Some of the customers' heads turned but the salesman froze.'Shhhhh!' he whispered.He didn't want the customers to connect me with the tape; I assume he thought that if the punters saw me, they probably wouldn't buy it. But I was delighted to discover that it was a nice little earner for them.I used to have a copy but sadly I don't know what happened to it . . . if anyone finds Sexy Sonia in a charity shop, do let me know.It's hard to be subtle bellowing out lines like 'Wicked child!!! Drink is urine for the last leper in Hell!' I particularly relished slapping Rowan and Tim McInnerny each time I shouted 'Wicked Child!'I loved every moment of it and I loved the boys \u2014 they were a sweet, funny bunch and the atmosphere was totally different from the nail-biting competition of the Footlights. A generation or two later, there was a pleasure in each other's success and a generosity of spirit between the lads that I hadn't seen before.It was just as funny \u2014 funnier, even \u2014 but without the personal edge. I like people to get on, and my Blackadder pals were gentlemen and gentle men.I have always needed an audience and always loved acting, even at school. When, as Brutus in the Oxford High production of Julius Caesar, my toga kept slipping, revealing rather more bosom than Brutus was normally expected to have, some parents in the front row showed alarm.On another occasion, as Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream, I forgot my words but just made up some nonsense and carried on. Once a show-off, always a show-off!At Cambridge, I appeared in 20 productions. By my second year, I knew I wanted to be an actress and two years after graduating I began getting parts with the BBC Radio Drama Company (RDC).It was an honour to be in Blackadder. I was in it in three extreme incarnations: as a Spanish Infanta, as Queen Victoria and as my favourite, Lady Whiteadder, the fanatical PuritanI loved it but it wasn't enough: I wanted to act with both my voice and my body, so I began auditioning for TV. One of my early TV appearances was in 1967, on the soap opera Crossroads, playing the rather unpleasant mother of a character called Shirley Perkins.There was a green room where we rested between takes. I was once sitting in an armchair when Noele Gordon, the star of Crossroads, came in.'That's MY chair,' she barked.'Oh sorry,' I said, 'I didn't see your name on it.'We reckoned she only had the job because she was sleeping with the boss of the channel. But that little tussle was nothing compared with my worst-ever professional experience, working with Glenda Jackson in The White Devil at the Old Vic in 1976.I played a servant to Glenda Jackson's character. A star actress with little patience and no humility, she has given great performances \u2014 but she didn't in The White Devil, and knowing that she was rubbish made her even nastier.It wasn't just her. The general mood was unpleasant and rivalry and discord among the cast members sporadically bubbled over in little moments of irritation and nastiness.It was the hottest summer on record. We poured with sweat all day; the physical discomfort was intense and that spilled over into rehearsals. I've talked to other cast members about our experience, however, and not all hated it. My own misery may have coloured my memories.One day, Glenda and I had a terrible falling-out; I cannot remember what it was about, but I called her a cow and she called me an amateur. I think she won that one!  * There's never been a British star quite like Miriam... Now that's a pet project! Paul O'Grady's memories of school...Also in the cast was Jonathan Pryce, who was particularly combative and scornful if anyone made mistakes. He patrolled the set like a shark, eating up errors from other cast members.It didn't help that our opening night had to be delayed. During the eventual opening-night curtain call, the composer and conductor Andre Previn, who was in the audience, got up and shouted, 'Rubbish!' and the show closed after only six weeks.It is agony to go on stage every night and know your work is poor \u2014 but when it goes well there is no feeling like it; to inhabit your part and to hear the audience gasp and know they are catching their breath because of you.I cherish my audiences and am grateful for them, yet my stage fright has only increased as I've got older. I now have to have a bucket in the wings because I am so often sick before I go on stage. I'm not alone in this: Maggie Smith once told me how nervous she gets, to the point of vomiting.And this is but one potential pitfall of working in the theatre. There are so many more. It was after one performance of She Stoops To Conquer, with Donald Sinden and David Essex, that Princess Margaret came backstage. Tiny and cool, she had enjoyed the show and congratulated us. Carl Toms, a friend of hers, had designed the show. I knew he had been ill and, without thinking, asked if she would pass on to him our loving best wishes.For a split second, her eyes narrowed and she stiffened. She was deciding whether I had been guilty of massive impertinence. But she saw from my concerned face that I only wanted to send Carl good wishes. She relaxed and said: 'Yes, I will. I enjoyed your performance, rushing acraws the stage, backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards.' And, finally, she smiled.The danger was over but I would not fare as well with her older sister. As I will explain in tomorrow's Mail, meeting the Queen was something I had dreamed of all my life \u2014 but my one and only encounter with Her Majesty actually ended with my getting a royal reprimand.Adapted from This Much Is True, by Miriam Margolyes, published by John Murray on September 16, \u00a320. \u00a9 Miriam Margolyes 2021.Pre-order a copy of This Much Is True for \u00a310 (RRP \u00a320) at whsmith.co.uk by entering code MIRIAM at checkout.

For its 2021 fall-winter season, the storied theater company plans to continue this tradition. Some attention-grabbing standouts, per the _New York Times,_ include an Indigenous spin on Shakespeare's _Midsummer Night 's Dream_ retooled as _Misdemeanor Dream_ , a dramatic exploration of the Tulsa Race Massacre tied to the domestic tragedy's centennial anniversary and a vaudeville concert about the history of cannabis.The latest slate of offerings comes after a considerable period of change and adjustments for La MaMa. The theater company was forced to switch digital streams of plays and performances during a bulk of the Covid-19 pandemic, like nearly all of New York's cultural institutions, and, at the same time, navigate a three-year, $24 million renovation of its flagship theater at 74A East Fourth Street. All of the announced shows so far will take place at the company's other two locations, the Ellen Stewart Theater and Downstairs, located at 66 East Fourth Street. The 74A East Fourth Street is expected to reopen with a dramatic new look (including two separate theaters, a cafe and open-air terrace) and its own soon-to-be-announced slate of shows.The new season will start with a kid-friendly return of the La MaMa Puppet Series running September 27-October 24. Later, the premiere of James E. Reynold's _History/Our Story: The Trail to Tulsa_ , a multidisciplinary experience unpacking the horror and legacy of the Tulsa Massacre, which runs through December 9-12. Then, in March, the premiere of Misdemeanor Dream will take place. The bold production features  20 Indigenous actors cast in a subversive take on one of Shakespeare's most famous works.You can find out more information about the return of La MaMa's in-person performances and safety measures here.Popular on Time OutShare the storyAn email you\u2019ll actually loveGet into a relationship with our newsletter.

(@MotoGP) September 12, 2021Polesitter Darryn Binder (Petronas Sprinta Racing) launched away from the line well and grabbed the holeshot into Turn 1, with Garcia making a fast start from P4 to make his way up to second by the time the riders had raced through Sector 1. Garcia then looked to take the lead down into Turn 12, however, the Spaniard got it a bit wrong and ran wide, dropping to P4. Gabriel Rodrigo (Indonesian Racing Gresini Moto3) took the lead heading down the back straight for the first time and led over the line, with all riders safely negotiating Lap 1.Acosta was battling away inside the top 10, as he and Rodrigo made contact on Lap 3 at Turn 9. Filip Sala\u010d (CarXpert Pr\u00fcstelGP) crashed out of the top 10 at Turn 12, rider ok, as we witnessed a very frantic opening few laps. Acosta and Garcia were both scrapping inside the top five, but they had plenty of hungry riders for company. \u00d6nc\u00fc looked comfortable holding the P1 baton, but further back in the lead group, Rodrigo suffered a highside at the final corner. The Argentine was out of the race, thankfully up on his feet, as British GP winner Romano Fenati (Sterilgarda Max Racing Team) had to take to the gravel to avoid contact.> Five laps remaining!!! ????  > Anyone in the top ten still has a chance here! \u270a#Moto3 | #AragonGP ???? pic.twitter.com/3Z9BVvrqgq> -- MotoGP\u2122???? (@MotoGP) September 12, 2021At half race distance, Xavier Artigas (Leopard Racing) took his turn leading, \u00d6nc\u00fc soon returned to the lead though as we saw an 11-rider lead group form. Garcia vs Acosta was in full flow, the two title rivals were squabbling in P4 and P5, with both Leopard Racing Hondas a constant threat. Izan Guevara (Gaviota GASGAS Aspar Team), Sasaki, Andrea Migno (Rivacold Snipers Team) and Binder were locked together, with \u00d6nc\u00fc still leading with four laps to go.Then, with four laps to go, huge drama. At Turn 5, Acosta and Artigas were down and out of the race. Acosta dived up the inside of the Leopard rider and tucked the front, causing the Championship leader to hit Artigas\u2019 rear wheel. Now, all eyes were on Garcia. How much damage could the GASGAS star inflict on his rival\u2019s title lead? Garcia was P3 with two laps to go as Foggia passed \u00d6nc\u00fc at Turn 1, before Garcia climbed to P2 at Turn 8. However, \u00d6nc\u00fc was straight back up the inside at Turn 12.__Incredible Moto3\u2122 title drama as top two crash out in Aragon 12/09/2021Pedro Acosta and Sergio Garcia both blew their podium chances with costly blunders in the lightweight class raceFinal lap time, Foggia led \u00d6nc\u00fc, Garcia and Guevara. Contact at Turn 2 between teammates Garcia and Guevara occurred as the Spaniards connected three times halfway through the lap, as \u00d6nc\u00fc carved up the inside at Turn 5 to take the lead. Yet more Championship drama was about to unfold though. In an incredibly fierce final lap, Garcia was third but was late on the brakes into Turn 12. It turned out to be too late, as the Spaniard crashed unhurt. This left \u00d6nc\u00fc leading Foggia for the race win, but on the back straight, Foggia unleashed his Honda power and drafted past the Turkish rider, held it around the final two corners to claim victory. \u00d6nc\u00fc missed out on a maiden victory by just 0.041s, as Sasaki made it two Tech3 riders on the rostrum with a brilliant P3.After showing great pace all weekend, Guevara picked up a second consecutive P4 finish as his podium wait continues \u2013 but it\u2019s not far away. Niccolo Antonelli (Avintia VR46 Academy) picked up P5 ahead of compatriot Migno and seventh place Binder, as Stefano Nepa (BOE Owlride) earns P8. Tatsuki Suzuki (SIC58 Squadra Corse) was a tenth behind Nepa in P9, Jaume Masia (Red Bull KTM Ajo) had a quiet race and eventually claimed P10 on home soil.Ryusei Yamanaka (CarXpert Pr\u00fcstelGP) crossed the line in a relatively lonely P11, Adrian Fernandez (Sterilgarda Max Racing Team) picked up P12, John McPhee\u2019s Petronas Sprinta Racing replacement Syaifuddin Azman earned P13 on his World Championship debut, with Fenati salvaging P14 after getting unfortunately caught up in Rodrigo\u2019s crash, Riccardo Rossi (BOE Owlride) was the final point scorer.As the dust settles on a scintillating Moto3\u2122 race, Acosta\u2019s lead in the Championship remains unchanged. 46 points are his advantage over Garcia, with Foggia now just 12 adrift of second place with his victory.

Federal Registers  2. Respiratory Protection**29 CFR Parts 1910, 1915, and 1926****AGENCY:** Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Labor.**ACTION:** Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) and public hearings.**SUMMARY:** OSHA is proposing to modify its existing standards on respiratory protection (29 CFR 1910.134, 29 CFR 1915.152 and 29 CFR 1926.103). The current respirator standard was adopted from a voluntary consensus standard in 1971. Since that time, changes in methodology, technology, and approach related to respiratory protection have occurred, which OSHA's standard does not include. The purpose of this rulemaking is to update the current standard to reflect these changes so that employers will provide effective protection for employees who wear respirators.The proposed standard includes requirements for a written respiratory protection program; procedures for selecting respirators; requirements for medical evaluation; procedures for fit testing; requirements for using respirators; procedures for maintaining respirators; training; criteria for evaluating program effectiveness. Public hearings are being scheduled to provide interested parties the opportunity to orally present information and data related to the issues raised by this proposed rule.**DATES:** Written comments on the proposed standard must be postmarked on or before February 13, 1995. Notices of intention to appear at the informal public hearings on the proposed standard must be postmarked by January 27, 1995. Parties who request more than 10 minutes for their presentations at the informal public hearing and parties who will submit documentary evidence at the hearing must submit the full test of their testimony and all documentary evidence postmarked no later than February 13, 1995\\. The hearing will take place in Washington, D.C. and is scheduled to being on March 7, 1995 and continue until Friday, March 24, 1995.**ADDRESSES:** Written comments should be submitted in quadruplicate or 1 original (hardcopy) and 1 disk (5 1/4 or 3 1/2 ) in WordPerfect 5.0, 5.1, 6.0 or ASCII to: The Docket Office, Docket H-049, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Room N2625, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

Clearance of Information Collection Requirements**5 CFR Part 1320 sets forth procedures for agencies to follow in obtaining OMB clearance for information collection requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The proposed revised respirator standard requires employers to allow OSHA access to records. In accordance with the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, OSHA certifies that it has submitted the information collection requirements for this proposed rule on respiratory protection to OMB for review under Section 3504(h) of that Act. OMB has approved (OMB number 1218-0099) in concept the submitted information collection activities contained in the proposed revision pending public consideration and comment.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to be five minutes per response. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, to the Office of Information Management, Department of Labor, Room N-1301, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1218-AA05), Washington, DC 20503.A.

History of the Development of Respiratory ProtectionThe concept of using respiratory protective devices to reduce or eliminate hazardous exposures to airborne contaminants first came from Pliny (c. A.D. 23-79) who discussed the use of loose fitting animal bladders in Roman mines to protect workers from the inhalation of red oxide of lead (1,2). Later, in the 1700's, the ancestors of modern atmosphere-supplying devices, such as the self-contained breathing apparatus or hose mask, were developed. Although the devices themselves have become more sophisticated in design and materials, respirators' performance is still based on one of two basic principles; purifying the air by removing contaminants before they reach the breathing zone of the worker, or providing clean air from an uncontaminated source.In 1814, a particulate-removing filter encased in a rigid container was developed -- the predecessor of modern filters for air-purifying respirators. In 1854, it was recognized that activated charcoal could be used as a filtering medium for vapors. World War I and the use of chemical warfare also resulted in improvement in the design of respirators. Overall, there have been few major developments in the basic design of respirators over the years except for the resin-impregnated dust filter in 1930. This development has made available efficient, inexpensive filters that have good dust-loading characteristics and low breathing resistance. Another more recent development is the ultrahigh efficiency filter made from paper that contains very fine glass fibers. These extremely efficient filters are used for very small airborne particles and produce little breathing resistance.C. Respirator UseThe purpose of a respirator is to prevent the inhalation of harmful airborne substances. Functionally, a respirator is designed as an enclosure which covers the nose and mouth or the entire face or head. Respirators are of two general \"fit\" types: Tight fitting (i.e., quarter masks, which cover the mouth and nose, and where the lower sealing surface rests between the chin and the mouth; the half mask, which fits over the nose and under the chin; and the full facepiece, which covers from the hairline to below the chin), and loose fitting (i.e., hoods, helmets, blouses, or full suits which cover the head completely). There are two major classes of respirators: Air-purifying respirators (devices which remove contaminants from the air), and atmosphere-supplying respirators (those which provide clean breathing air from an uncontaminated source).Air-purifying respirators are grouped into three general types:Particulate removing, vapor and gas removing, and combination. Elements which remove particulates are called filters, while vapor and gas removing elements are called either chemical cartridges or canisters. Filters and canisters/cartridges are the functional portion of air-purifying respirators, and they can generally be removed and replaced once their effective life has expired. The exception would be disposable respirators, those which cannot be cleaned and disinfected or resupplied with an unused filter after use. Combination elements that protect for both particulates and vapors and gases are also available.Particulate-removing respirators are designed to reduce inhaled concentrations of nuisance dusts, fumes, mists, toxic dusts, radon daughters, asbestos containing dusts or fibers, or any combination of these substances, by filtering some of the contaminants from the inhaled air before they enter the breathing zone of the worker. They may have single use or replaceable filters. These respirators may be non-powered or powered air-purifying (using a blower to pull contaminated air through a filter; the resulting cleaned air is blown on the face).Vapor and gas removing respirators are designed with sorbent elements (canisters or cartridges) that adsorb and/or absorb the vapors or gases from the contaminated air before they enter the breathing zone of the worker. Combination cartridges and canisters are available to protect against both particulates and vapors and gases.Atmosphere-supplying respirators are respirators which provide air from a source independent of the surrounding atmosphere instead of removing contaminants from the atmosphere. These respirators are classified by the method by which air is supplied and the way in which the air supply is regulated. Basically, these methods are: Self-contained breathing apparatus (air or oxygen is carried in a tank on the worker's back, similar to SCUBA gear); supplied air respirators (compressed air from a stationary source is supplied through a high pressure hose connected to the respirator); and combination self-contained and supplied air respirators.D. Types of Respiratory HazardsRespiratory hazards may result from either an oxygen deficient atmosphere or from breathing air contaminated with toxic particles, vapors, gases, fumes or mists. The proper selection and use of a respirator depends upon an initial determination of the concentration of the hazard or hazards present in the workplace.Contaminants are classified as particulate contaminants, which include mechanical dispersoids, condensation dispersoids, dusts, sprays, fumes, mists, fogs, smokes, and smogs; and vapors or gases which include acids, alkalines, organics, organometallics, hydrides, and inert materials.The particulates may be dusts such as clays, limestone, gypsum, or aluminum oxides; inert pulmonary reaction producing substances such as silicates; minimal pulmonary fibrosis producing substances such as iron oxide or tin oxide; extensive pulmonary fibrosis producing substances such as free silica or asbestos; chemical irritants such as acids or alkalies; systemic poisons such as pesticides, hydrogen cyanide or lead; allergy producing substances such as cotton, isocyanates, epichlorohydrin, fur fibers, or vegetable fibers; and febrile-reaction producing agents such as bagasse, or copper and zinc oxide; and biological materials.The gaseous air contaminants include irritants such as nitrogen dioxide, phosgene, and arsenic trichloride; asphyxiants such as carbon monoxide, and hydrogen cyanide; anesthetics such as nitrous oxide, hydrocarbons, and ethyl and isopropyl ether; and systemic poisons such as carbon tetrachloride.E. Limitations of Respirator UseNot all workers can wear respirators. Individuals with impaired lung function, due to asthma or emphysema for example, may be physically unable to wear a respirator. Individuals who cannot get a good facepiece fit, including those individuals whose beards or sideburns interfere with the facepiece seal, will be unable to wear tight fitting respirators. Determination of adequate fit is required for a respirator to be effective.In addition to the problems with usage already discussed, respirators may also present communication problems, vision problems, fatigue and reduced work efficiency. Nonetheless, it is sometimes necessary to use respiratory protection as the means of control.In principle, respirators frequently may be capable of providing adequate protection. However, problems associated with selection, fit, and use often render them ineffective in actual application, preventing the assurance of consistent and reliable protection; regardless of the theoretical capabilities of the respirator. Occupational safety and health experts have spent considerable effort over the years developing fit testing procedures and methods of measuring respirator protection so that these adverse variables can be better controlled, thereby improving protection for those employees required to wear them.The comments which resulted from the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) that was published by OSHA on May 14, 1982 (47 FR 20803) suggest that one method for controlling some of the problems associated with respirator selection, fit, and use is to describe clearly the steps to be followed in administering a program to protect employees required to wear respirators. The modifications in this proposal are also intended to upgrade the provisions in Sec. 1910.134 to reflect the current state of the art in respiratory methodology and technology.Authority for issuance of this proposed revised standard is found primarily in sections 6(b), 8(c), and 8(g)(2) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the Act), 29 U.S.C. 655(b), and 657(g)(2).Section 6(b) authorizes the Secretary to \"by rule promulgate, modify, or revoke any occupational safety and health standard.\" This notice is the first mandatory step in the procedure prescribed for promulgating such new or modified standards.The Congress specifically mandated that:The Secretary, in promulgating standards dealing with toxic materials, or harmful physical agents under this subsection, shall set the standard which most adequately assure, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure to the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life. Development of standards under this subsection shall be based upon research, demonstrations, experiments, and such other information as may be appropriate. In addition to the attainment, of highest degree of health and safety protection for the employee, other considerations shall be the latest available scientific data in the field, the feasibility of standards, and experience gained under this section and other health and safety laws. (Section 6(b)(5).The revisions which OSHA proposes would update current standards concerning respiratory protection mainly by incorporating technological advances and by expanding certain respirator program elements such as fit testing and by clarifying other provisions.These revisions are intended to ensure that employees who use respirators to protect them from workplace atmospheric contamination, will be protected to the technical limitations of the devices they wear. Protection from exposure to workplace airborne contaminants is one of the major goals of the Act and a major mission for the Agency, since the risk to employees of chronic and acute disease because of exposure to toxic substances is substantial and well documented (see e.g., preamble to 29 CFR Part 1910, Air Contaminants, Proposed Rule, at 53 FR 20960 et seq.) Similarly, these regulations need to be updated to assure that employees are protected to the extent that currently available technology permits. Therefore OSHA finds that revisions to these regulations governing respiratory protection are clearly necessary and appropriate to protect employees against the risk of material impairment of health or functional capacity and are issued pursuant to the authority of section 6(b)(5) ofAuthority to issue this standard is also found in section 8(c) of the Act. In general, this section empowers the Secretary to require employers to make, keep, and preserve records regarding activities related to the Act. In particular, section 8(c) gives the Secretary authority to require employers to \"maintain accurate records of employee exposures to potentially toxic materials or harmful physical agents which are required to be monitored or measured under section 6.\" Provisions of OSHA standards which require the preparation and monitoring of exposure records, such as contained in a written respirator program, are also issued pursuant to section 8(c) of the Act.The Secretary's authority to issue this proposed standard is further supported by the general rulemaking authority granted in section 8(g)(2) of the Act. This section empowers the Secretary \"to prescribe such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary to carry out [his] responsibilities under the Act\" \\-- in this case as part of or ancillary to, a section 6(b) standard. The Secretary's responsibilities under the Act are defined largely by its enumerated purposes, which include:Encouraging employers and employees in their efforts to reduce the number of occupational safety and health hazards at their places of employment, and to stimulate employers and employees to institute new and to perfect existing programs for providing safe and healthful working conditions (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(1));Authorizing the Secretary of Labor to set mandatory occupational safety and health standards applicable to business affecting interstate commerce, and by creating an Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission for carrying out adjudicatory functions under the Act; (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(3));Building upon advances already made through employee and employer initiative for providing safe and health working conditions (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(5));By providing for the development and promulgation of occupational safety and health standards; providing for appropriate reporting procedures with respect to occupational safety and health which procedures will help achieve the objectives of this Act and accurately describe the nature of the occupational safety and health problem; exploring ways to discover latent diseases, establishing causal connections between diseases and work in environmental conditions * * * (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(6));Encouraging joint labor-management efforts to reduce injuries and diseases arising out of employment (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(13));And developing innovative methods, techniques, and approaches for dealing with occupational safety and health problems (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(5)).Because this proposed revised standard is reasonably related to these statutory goals, the Secretary finds that this standard is necessary to carry out his responsibilities under the Act.In addition, section 4(b)(2) of the Act provides for OSHA standards to apply to construction and other work places where the Secretary determines these standards to be more effective than existing standards which otherwise apply to those workplaces. So we are applying them to construction and maritime.The Supreme Court's benzene decision (Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute. 448 U.S. 601) requires OSHA, in general, to make a \"significant risk determination\" before issuing health and safety standards. It is clear that exposure to hazardous air contaminants in the workplace poses significant risks to workers. Where engineering controls cannot be used to reduce exposures below hazardous levels, respirators properly selected, fitted and worn can contribute substantially to a reduction in the level of air contaminants reaching the employee's breathing zone. Under the current respiratory protection standard, which lacks adequate requirements for fit testing, selection, medical evaluation, use, maintenance, and respiratory protection program provisions, employees wearing respirators are receiving less protection than the respirators can potentially give, and in some cases may suffer exposure to hazards as a result of improper respirator use. The significantrisk to employees therefore has not been adequately reduced by the existing respirator standard.The enforcement experience of OSHA and various state health agencies demonstrate the wide-spread nature of defects in respirator programs while the unamended respirator standard has been in effect. From fiscal 1977 to 1982, 58% of inspected worksites where respirators were used to protect against excessive levels of air contamination had deficiencies in at least one respirator area, including respirator fit condition, unapproved or unsuitable respirators, and lack of continuous wear (Ex. 33-5). Inadequate supervision of respirator use was cited as a major cause of improper and ineffective usage by the North Carolina Department of Labor, Kentucky's Department of Labor and Virginia's Bureau of Occupational Health (Docket H-160, Ex. 2-69, 2-103, 2-129). These state plan states have respirator standards that are the same as OSHA's unamended standard.OSHA cannot precisely quantify the risk to employees whose employers rely on inadequate respiratory protection programs to protect them against excessive levels of atmospheric contamination. However, the widespread levels of improper use of respirators put at significant risk employees who, at least some of the time, are overexposed to air contaminants. Based on OSHA's experience that one half of workplaces using respirators use them incorrectly under the current standard, even a small improvement in respirator use should work a significant reduction in the risk of developing adverse health effects because of preventable misuse of respirators. OSHA believes that a greater benefit will result from the imposition of these revised requirements for the following reason.Each controllable variable of respirator performance, i.e., initial fit, appropriateness of selection, and consistency of use is addressed by these revisions. The proposed requirement for a program administrator, for example, addresses the concerns of many commenters that proper supervision is the core of an adequate respirator program and effective respirator performance. Required fit testing protocols are proposed to assure that the respirator does not leak around the face, is comfortable and that the employee is taught how to properly tension straps for optimum fit and comfort. Thus the proposed revised standard with its provisions for quantitative and qualitative fit testing, improved and clarified respirator selection, use, and maintenance, will increase the effectiveness of respirators worn in the workplace and significantly reduce the risks to employees to a greater degree than the present standard.OSHA has quantified the risk and reduction of risk as part of the regulatory analysis and regulatory flexibility analysis, Section VI of the preamble. That analysis clearly shows that workers wearing respirators under the requirements of the current standard are exposed to a significant risk of chronic and acute health effects because of the inadequacies of the present standard. OSHA seeks comment on the issue of significant risk and how the proposed respirator standard revisions will affect that risk, along with any comment on the regulatory analysis performed by OSHA and all other issues related to significant risk.A. Regulatory HistoryCongress created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 1970, and gave it the responsibility for promulgating standards to protect the health and safety of American workers. As directed by Congress in the Occupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA adopted existing Federal or national consensus standards, developed by various organizations such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) and the American National Standard Institute (ANSI). The ANSI standard Z88.2-1969, \"Practices for Respiratory Protection\" (3), is the origin of the first six sections of OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.134, \"Respiratory Protection\" (4). The seventh section is a direct, complete inclusion of ANSI Standard K13.1-1969, \"Identification of Gas Mask Canisters.\" Until the adoption of these standards by OSHA, most guidance on respiratory protective device use in hazardous environments was advisory rather than mandatory.The construction industry standard for respiratory protection, 29 CFR 1926.103, was promulgated in April 1971. On February 9, 1979, 29 CFR 1910.134 was formally recognized as also being applicable to the construction industry (44 FR 8577) (4). OSHA is required under the OSH Act to seek the advice of an existing advisory committee when promulgating a rule which will affect an industry represented by the committee. In view of the application of the respirator protection standard to the construction industry, OSHA distributed copies of the draft of this proposed revised standard on September 20, 1985 to the Construction Advisory Committee for review and discussion at their next meeting in February 1986 so that the Construction Advisory Committee could prepare its official response. The response that was received from the committee was considered in revising the draft proposal as discussed later in this preamble.The maritime standards were originally promulgated in the 1960's under a different codification in the CFR by agencies which preceded OSHA. The present code designations and their promulgation dates are, as follows: 29 CFR 1915.82, February 20, 1960 (25 FR 1543); 29 CFR 1916.82, January 22, 1963 (28 FR 547); 29 CFR 1917.82, March 27, 1964 (29 FR 4052); and 29 CFR 1918.102, February 20, 1960 (25 FR 1565) (4).The current 29 CFR 1910.134 requires that the employer establish and implement a comprehensive respiratory protection program. The program is to contain written procedures and provide for proper cleaning, disinfection, storage, inspection and maintenance of the respirators. General provisions are set forth on fitting and training. Requirements are included for quality of breathing air and practices to ensure that it is not contaminated. Provisions for emergencies and for communication and rescue in atmospheres immediately dangerous to life or health are specified. A color code for gas mask cansisters is detailed and other provisions are included.The current standard requires the employer to instruct and train employees \"in the proper use of respirators and their limitations.\" The additional provisions of the proposal amplify the current requirements by specifying, for example, that the training program include instruction in procedures for inspection, donning and removal, checking the fit, and sufficient practice to enable the employee to become thoroughly familiar and confident with the use of the respirator. OSHA believes, based on its experience promulgating and enforcing respirator provisions in other health standards and Sec. 1910.134, that such hands-on training can materially improve the effectiveness of respirator use.Recent OSHA health standards have imposed respirator related requirements not found in 29 CFR 1910.134 (See section 1910.1018(h), arsenic; section 1910.1025(f), lead; section 1910.1029(g), coke oven emissions; and section 1910.1043(f), cotton dust). These requirements include the following provisions.  * Quantitative fit tests have been required semiannually, (arsenic, 1910.1018(h)(3)(ii); lead, 1910.1025(f)(3)(ii).  * Employees have been given the option of using powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) upon request (arsenic, 1910.1018(h)(5)(iii); lead, 1910.1025(f)(2)(ii); coke oven emissions, 1910.1029(g)(2)(ii); cotton dust, 1910.1043(f)(2)(iv)).  * Employees have been permitted to change the filter elements of a respirator whenever an increase in breathing resistance is detected, (arsenic, 1910.1018(h)(4)(ii); lead, 1910.1025(f)(4)(ii); coke oven emissions, 1910.1029(g)(4)(ii); cotton dust, 1910.1043(f)(4)(ii)).  * Employees have been permitted to wash their faces and respirator facepieces to prevent skin irritation associated with using respirators, (arsenic, 1910.1018(h)(4)(iii); lead 1910.1025(f)(4)(iii); coke oven emissions, 1910.1029(g)(4)(iii); cotton dust 1910.1043(f)(4)(iii).  * Employers have been required to provide respirators that exhibit minimum facepiece leakage, (arsenic, 1910.1018(h)(3)(i); lead, 1910.1025(f)(3)(i); coke oven emissions, 1910.1029(g)(4)(i); cotton dust 1910.1043(f)(4)(i)).  * Referral of an employee to a physician trained in pulmonary medicine has been required for an employee who exhibits difficulty breathing either at fit testing or during routine respirator use (arsenic, 1910.1018(h)(3)(iv); lead, 1910.1025(f)(3)(iii)).The current respirator standard (1910.134(b)(11)) states that respirators that are \"approved or accepted shall be used when available.\" OSHA has chosen to recognize only those respirators approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). The NIOSH and MSHA respirator performance requirements are given in Title 30, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 11. A revision of that standard is now being considered by NIOSH and MSHA.Because of differences with the respirator requirements in other OSHA standards, changes in respirator methodology and technology, and the revision of referenced documents or related codes, OSHA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) on May 14, 1982 (47 FR 20803). This notice sought information on the effectiveness of the current provisions, the need for revision, and the substance of what these revisions might be. Responses were received from 81 interested parties, and generally supported revising OSHA's respiratory protection provisions and provided suggestions for approaches the Agency might take (Ex. 15).On September 17, 1985 OSHA announced the availability of a preliminary draft of the proposed respiratory protection standard revision for public comment (the preproposal draft standard press release). This preproposal draft standard reflected the public comments received from the May 1982 ANPR and OSHA's own analysis of changes needed in the standard to take into account the current state-of-the-art for respiratory protection. Responses were received from 56 interested parties (Ex. 36) and their comments have been reviewed in preparing this proposal.B. Need for the StandardThis rulemaking addresses an existing standard, rather than addressing a new subject area, and seeks to correct the inadequacies of that existing standard. Since the OSHA standards on respiratory protection were adopted, research on the proper use of such equipment has resulted in new technology which improves protection for the wearers. The current standards do not reflect what is now accepted practice for implementation of comprehensive respiratory protection programs to protect employees. This is particularly true in the areas of fit testing and assignment of protection factors to respirators.The wearing of respiratory protective devices to reduce exposure to airborne contaminants is widespread in industry. It has been estimated that 2.6 million workers wear respirators, either occasionally or routinely, in non-emergency work situations. In addition, over 59,000 facilities maintain respirators for emergency use (5, Ex. 34). Although in most situations it is preferred industrial hygiene practice to use engineering controls to reduce contaminant emissions at their source, there are operations where this type of control is not technologically or economically feasible or is otherwise inappropriate. There are many variables which affect the degree of protection afforded by these respiratory protective devices.Indeed, the misuse of respirators can actually be hazardous to employee safety and health. Selection of the wrong equipment, one of the most frequent errors made in respiratory protection, will result in the employee being unknowingly vulnerable to the hazard and thus inhaling concentrations of the contaminant that may be harmful. This may result in a broad range of health effects caused by airborne contaminants, including silicosis, asbestosis, permanent lung damage and cancer. In the report by Rosenthal and Paull (Ex. 33-5) it is shown that, on the basis of OSHA's citation records, there is a high degree of correlation between inadequate respirator programs and overexposures to respirator wearers exposed to regulated substances. Respirators which are not maintained, inspected, and cleaned, can actually increase exposure, as well as cause dermatitis or skin irritation and place a greater strain on the respiratory system. Because the wearing of the respirator gives the employee a senseof security and presumed protection which may be false, an improper respirator program presents a high degree of hazard for the employee.The devices themselves can only provide the protection they are designed for if they are properly selected for the task; if they are fitted to the wearer and are consistently donned and worn properly; and if they are maintained and cared for so they continue to provide the protection required for the work situation. These variables can only be controlled if a comprehensive respiratory protection program is developed and implemented in each workplace where respirators are used to protect employees from inhalation of airborne contaminants. OSHA has reviewed the present rulemaking record and the record of citations for respirator standard violations. On the basis of that review it is clear that to be effective such a program must use an integrated, systematic approach that will result in consistent and appropriate choices of respiratory equipment to be used; involvement of employees to ensure that they understand why respirators are being worn, and how they contribute to their effectiveuse; and monitoring of the equipment and its use to ensure that respirator effectiveness is optimized.There are many examples of how respirators may not provide the protection they were designed to provide in the absence of an effective respirator program with adequate employee training. When the hazardous substance is a dust, mist or fume there are often conditions under which it is possible for the inside of the respirator to become contaminated with the hazardous substance. For example, the employee may have an itch on the cheek and scratch it with a dirty finger thus destroying the integrity of the respirator fit.An employee may leave the respirator area, remove the respirator, and rest it on his or her chest. The inside of the respirator could then pick up the contaminant from the air or work clothes and later when the respirator is donned the employee will inhale the contaminant from within the respirator. If a respirator is not cleaned properly or if it is stored in a locker or on a ledge covered with the contaminant, the employee will again breathe in the contaminant from within the respirator.An employee engaged in manual labor may dislodge the respirator with a tool or even a normal motion unless the respirator has been appropriately fit tested and the employee knows that a readjustment is necessary. An employee may be engaged in work which requires good vision or extensive communication. Without conscious thought the employee may push the respirator into a position that improves vision or make talking easier but which would result in a poor facepiece seal.As discussed later in this preamble, several studies of the performance of respirators worn in the workplace have been submitted to the regulatory docket to show that in actual use, respirators can be effective. These studies of workplace protection factors (WPFs) are necessarily performed in workplaces which have good respiratory protection programs. Consequently though the studies on WPFs may provide a reasonable criterion for setting maximum protection factors, it is not the case that those levels of protection are always achieved even if employers have an adequate respirator program. In the case of a poor respirator program it should be apparent that these levels would seldom be achieved.The complexity of the necessary program, and the extensive commitment of ongoing resources to maintain that program, are often not sufficiently considered when determining control measures to be used. As stated in one commonly used industrial hygiene text (6):There will always be a temptation to resort to respirators as a cheap substitute for a ventilation system. If this is done it is clear that management has not carefully considered the alternatives since reliance on and effective use of respirators is definitely not cheap.As discussed above, OSHA's current standard in 29 CFR 1910.134 was largely adopted from, and references, the ANSI Z88.2-1969 standard on respiratory protection. ANSI issued a revised version of that standard in 1980 (ANSI Z88.2-1980) (Ex. 10). ANSI's intent in issuing this revision was to ensure that the standard did \"reflect the current state of the art.\" ANSI accomplished this by expanding and adding to the standard provisions which address technological developments in respiratory protection since the 1969 standard was published. Techniques in fit testing and the use of protection factors are two areas which have been elaborated upon in the 1980 standard to help ensure more effective protection for respirator wearers.This change highlights the need for revising the OSHA standard, particularly since Sec. 1910.134(c) specifies that respirators are to be selected according to the 1969 ANSI standard and provides no additional guidance for employers. Moreover, it is necessary to change OSHA's standard to ensure that it too reflects current respiratory protection methodology in order to provide appropriate protection for employees.The 1980 ANSI standard was a logical extension of the 1969 ANSI standard (and thus OSHA's) in many respects. It established requirements for a respiratory protection program so that respirator selection, fit, and use were standardized, thus controlling some of the variables which make respirators ineffective. The program was to include written standard operating procedures; assessment of the fitness of potential respirator wearers; selection of respirators; training; fit testing; maintenance; and program evaluation.One regulatory alternative in this regard would have been to adopt the ANSI Z88.2-1980 standard, or to at least base the rulemaking largely on the latest ANSI standard as was done with the original OSHA standard. ANSI, however, was developing a major revision of its 1980 standard, recently finalized as ANSI Z88.2-1992. OSHA has given this latest ANSI standard detailed consideration in preparing this proposal. An OSHA standard based entirely on the 1980 ANSI standard would have been obsolete as soon as published. OSHA has therefore made the decision to pursue a rulemaking based on existing data and the record generated thus far by responses to the ANPR and the prepublication draft. The proposed standard has included provisions of the 1980 and 1992 ANSI standards where justified by the record. The reasons for provisions which differ from those in the ANSI standards are given in this preamble in the discussion of the content of the proposed standard. OSHA has chosen not to adopt the ANSIstandard per se, but many of the provisions, as well as the general approach, are consistent with ANSI.In the ANPR, OSHA asked if the ANSI Z88.2-1980 standard should be adopted. For the most part, respondents did not advocate that the Agency simply adopt the ANSI standard (Ex. 15-13, 15-30, 15-34, 15-40, 15-45, 15-56, 15-73, 15-80). However, a number of respondents did advocate that it be used as guidelines or a reference for the OSHA standard or that modifications to it might make it appropriate for adoption (Ex. 15-19, 15-31, 15-37, 15-43, 15-51, 15-67).In the ANPR, OSHA requested comments on the need to revise Sec. 1910.134, and 1980 ANSI standard notwithstanding. Only five respondents indicated that the standard should not be revised (Ex. 15-10, 15-35, 15-56, 15-75 (A and B), 15-77). The overwhelming majority of respondents, representing a wide range of organizations, stated that Sec. 1910.134 needs to be revised to reflect current technology and to help ensure appropriate protection of employees (Ex. 15-11, 15-18, 15-20, 15-26, 15-30, 15-42, 15-50, 15-54, 15-62, 15-74, 15-76, 15-80).For example, industry respondents such as the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) expressed the view that (Ex. 15-22):The requirements of 1910.134 were adequate at the time they were adopted, but have been outdated by advances in respirator technology. The standard should be updated to reflect current conditions and to permit sufficient flexibility for companies to respond to continuing technological improvements. Present standards tend to suppress innovation and have a potential for harm by retarding the adoption of technological advances.The Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), an institution which has conducted considerable research on respiratory protection, also supported the need to revise OSHA's current standard, and commented upon the appropriate approach to take (Ex. 15-79):Currently standards should be revised to reflect changes in respiratory protection capabilities, techniques, and equipment which have been developed over the past 10 years. ANSI Z88.2 (1980) provides the best basis for developing a new standard. In addition, the \"Guide to Industrial Respiratory Protection\" (published as Los Alamos report LA-6671-M, and Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) Publication, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH 76-189) provides detailed information relative to the requirements for an adequate respirator program. It is not recommended that direct adoption of sections, of either of these documents, be the approach used by OSHA. Both documents are several years old, and the ANSI document constitutes a compromise between various interests involved in developing and adopting a consensus standard. Development of a revised standard will require a major effort by OSHA to identify, update, and expand those sections of ANSI Z88.2 (1980) whichshould be made part of the new OSHA standard.Labor representatives also supported revising the standard, as represented by this statement of the United Steelworkers of America (Ex. 15-28):At the present time the respiratory protection standard is not effective in providing workers with any great degree of protection due to the inadequacies of the standard, lack of requirements for employers to follow so that all respiratory protection programs are uniform and equally protective, and ineffective enforcement due to the vagueness of the requirements.Manufacturers of respiratory protective devices are also among those who support revising OSHA's current respiratory protection standards. For example, the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company stated (Ex. 15-30):When 1910.134 was promulgated nearly a decade ago it reflected the state-of-the-art for a good respiratory protection program. The state-of-the-art for respiratory protection, however, has rapidly advanced since that time and although many of the elements included in the original standard retain their relevance and importance, other elements have been developed and more efficient means for achieving the goals of an effective respiratory protection program have been introduced * * *There are two issues in particular which have evolved technologically since the current OSHA standards were adopted: Assignment of protection factors or maximum use concentrations for particular models or types of respirators; and the development of fit testing procedures.With respect to assigned protection factors, OSHA has decided not to establish its own set of numbers but instead to defer to NIOSH in setting assigned protection factors for the various respirator classes. NIOSH will be developing assigned protection factors as part of its revised respirator certification standard, 42 CFR Part 84. Since NIOSH may not publish 42 CFR Part 84 before this OSHA respirator standard revision is finalized, OSHA will in the interim enforce the assigned protection factors listed in the NIOSH Respirator Decision Logic (RDL). The concept of protection factors and the decision to defer to NIOSH are discussed in more detail in a later section of this preamble.Fit testing, the other area in which considerable advances have been made since the promulgation of OSHA's current standard, also varies among the substance-specific standards. The cotton dust standard (29 CFR 1910.1043) requires that the respirator used exhibit minimum facepiece leakage and be fitted properly. The coke oven emissions standard (29 CFR 1910.1029) requires annual quantitative fit testing, but has no protocol for fit testing. The lead standard (29 CFR 1910.1025) requires either qualitative or quantitative fit testing every six months and contains specific qualitative fit test protocols to be followed. Although the current respiratory protection standard refers to the necessity for proper fit, there are no procedures to follow or specific indications of how fit factors are to be taken into account in the assignment of respirators.There are two types of fit testing that can be used for tight fitting facepiece respirators that rely on a facepiece-to-face seal to perform adequately. Qualitative fit testing involves the introduction of a test agent into the breathing zone of the respirator wearer which can be detected by its irritant properties, taste, or smell. If the wearer detects the characteristic effect of the test agent used, it indicates that the respirator is leaking and does not fit properly, and thus a different respirator is needed to protect that employee. Quantitative fit testing involves the generation of a known concentration of a test agent outside the facepiece, and a measurement of the concentration within the facepiece of the respirator. The ratio of these concentrations yields a number which indicates the protective capability of the device. This approach does not involve the subjective response of the wearer as does the qualitative fit test.OSHA began including requirements for the use of quantitative fit testing in substance-specific standards starting in 1976 with the coke oven emissions standard. However, no procedures were provided. In the lead standard, OSHA conducted a separate rulemaking proceeding to address the appropriateness of QLFT. It was determined at that time that qualitative fit testing can be appropriate, but only under certain conditions. It was found, for example, that such fit testing can provide a reasonable degree of reliability only when specified protocols are followed. Thus the lead standard was revised to permit qualitative fit testing as well as quantitative fit testing to protect employees in atmospheres no greater than ten times the permissible exposure limit for lead, when exposed employees are wearing half mask negative pressure air-purifying respirators.The overall problems with respect to QLFT protocols that came to the surface in the lead standard revisions, plus the fact that there was no specified QNFT protocol, made it apparent that these subjects needed to be addressed in the overall respiratory protection standard. Proper fit is so essential to maximizing functioning of respirators that OSHA must include in its requirements the latest findings of respirator research on means to assess and assure such fit.In assessing the need to revise Sec. 1910.134, OSHA reviewed the Agency's enforcement statistics related to this standard for a period of about ten years, from 1972 to 1982 (9). This standard is one of the most frequently cited health standards, which indicates both a lack of understanding as to what is required for compliance, and a lack of awareness as to the importance of establishing and implementing a comprehensive respiratory protection program. During the period reviewed, there were 22,662 violations of the standard recorded, of which 8,406 were serious violations (37%). Some 3,648 of the violations were for not establishing a program (1,752 of these were serious because overexposure to hazardous substances were involved). Other commonly cited provisions include development of standard operating procedures; training and fit testing; cleaning and disinfection of equipment; storage of equipment; and use of approved respirators.Compliance should be enhanced by the provisions of the proposed standard. In those areas which are frequently cited, the new proposal provides additional guidance for employers to help ensure that they are aware of what is required to comply, and thus protect their employees adequately. OSHA expects that these revisions will improve the level of protection provided by the current standard: nothing in these revisions is intended to decrease protection provided under the current standard.To summarize OSHA's position, the Agency has determined that promulgating a revised respiratory protection standard is necessary to ensure that employees wearing respirators in the workplace are doing so under conditions which adequately protect their health. This determination by OSHA is supported by the public in responses to the ANPR published by the Agency. It is also necessitated by changes in respiratory protection methodology and subsequent revisions to the consensus standards upon which the current standard is based, thus making the current standard outdated. The determination of the need for the standard is also supported by OSHA's experiences in promulgating substance-specific standards with respiratory protection provisions in them, and in the Agency's enforcement experiences with the current standard.Based on an evaluation of these considerations, OSHA has prepared this proposed standard and is hereby initiating the public rulemaking process.C. Recognition of the Need for a Standard by Other GroupsThe need for standardization in this area, particularly for consistent guidance and controlled practices, can also be demonstrated by the number and extent of voluntary standards that have been adopted, as well as by the existence of standards at all levels of government.As has already been discussed, the primary voluntary consensus standard in this area was that developed by the American National Standards Institute as ANSI Z88.2-1980, entitled \"Practices for Respiratory Protection\" (Ex. 10). This standard was an updated version of the 1969 ANSI standard which was used as the primary basis of OSHA's current standard, Sec. 1910.134. Following are some of the 1980 ANSI standard changes:  * Oxygen deficiency is more thoroughly discussed.  * Quantitative fit testing is now included and described.  * Qualitative fit testing is more fully described.  * The concept of protection factors is introduced and protection factors are assigned.ANSI has also developed a new standard on physical qualifications for respirator use (ANSI Z88.6-1984) (Ex. 38-10).The OSHA standard, based on the outdated 1969 ANSI standard, does not address these topics. The ANSI revisions reinforce OSHA's decision to revise its standard to address the same and other issues.Other countries also recognized the need for standards governing the use of respirators. Of particular note is the consensus standard recently developed by the Canadian Standards Association (Z94.4-M1982, Selection, Care and Use of Respirators) (10). This document is a comprehensive treatment of the subject and, similar to OSHA's proposed standard, its emphasis is on the establishment and implementation of a comprehensive respiratory protection program. As stated in the preface to that standard:The primary aim of this Standard is to give detailed instruction in the selection of the proper respirator and its use and maintenance. The emphasis is on the implementation of a respiratory protection program developed in a logical progression of steps beginning with:(a) A very clear definition of the hazards that will be encountered and the degree of protection required;(b) The selection and fitting of the respirator;(c) The required training in the correct use and care of the respirator; and(d) The implementation of a maintenance program that will ensure that a high level of respiratory protection is maintained.The Canadian consensus standard deals with several areas in more detail than OSHA's current standard, and some of the language used has been incorporated into this proposed standard, particularly in the areas of training and program evaluation.Documents developed by U.S. military organizations also indicate the need for comprehensive respiratory protection programs. A military standard entitled \"Respiratory Protection Program\" (TB MED 223/AFOSH STD 161-1/DLAM 1000.2) has been developed for the use of the Air Force, Army, and the Defense Logistics Agency (15). This document is similar to OSHA's current standard (Sec. 1910.134), but includes sections which expand upon the requirements of that standard and provide additional guidance in critical areas. The military standard provides considerable direction on the selection of respirators, including the protection factor concept, that is not included in OSHA's current standard. It also provides additional information on fit testing and training. OSHA's proposed standard similarly recognizes the deficiencies of Sec. 1910.134, and provides additional guidance to employers in these same areas as well as others.It can be seen from this brief discussion that there is widespread agreement among safety and health professionals that adequate respiratory protection cannot be provided in the absence of specific procedures. The range of equipment choices available, the diversity of hazards against which they are to protect, the differences in work situations, and other variables increase the complexity of the decision making process in terms of selecting the appropriate respirators, and ensuring they fit, are worn properly, and are maintained as necessary. OSHA proposes to revise its current standard to ensure that appropriate procedures are implemented by employers, and thus increase the probability that protection to the extent technologically feasible for respirators will be provided for employees.Section 1910.134 requires that only those respirators approved jointly by NIOSH and MSHA be used by the employer when they exist. The current respirator testing and approval regulation, 30 CFR 11, which authorized the Bureau of Mines (BM) and NIOSH to jointly approve respiratory protection devices was promulgated on March 25, 1972 at 37 FR 6244. On November 5, 1974 the Mine Enforcement Safety Administration (MESA) joined NIOSH in jointly approving respirators. Following the transfer of MESA to the Department of Labor, where it became the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), authority was transferred on March 24, 1978 to MSHA for joint approval with NIOSH of respirators. Most of the BM respiratory testing methods, while developed in the 1950's or earlier, were changed in the 1970's to reflect changes in testing technology.NIOSH initiated revision of 30 CFR 11 in 1980. A public meeting was held in July 1980 to address the certification program. On August 27, 1987, NIOSH published a notice of proposed rulemaking (52 FR 32402) which would allow NIOSH to certify respirators under the new 42 CFR Part 84 regulations, replacing the current joint NIOSH/MSHA 30 CFR 11 certification regulations. The proposed NIOSH certification regulations contained new and revised requirements for testing and certification of respirators, and included a set of minimum assigned protection factors for various classes of respirators. Public hearings on the first draft NIOSH proposal were held in January, 1988. On the basis of the comments received, NIOSH is preparing a revised proposal for further public comment.Numerous commenters to the ANPR addressed the issue of NIOSH respirator certification (Ex. 15-11, 15-27A, 15-58, 15-14, 15-43, 15-50) and most agreed that the certification program should be improved. Some suggested that OSHA assume the function of certification of respirators. OSHA believes it is advisable not to undertake operation of the certification program currently operated by NIOSH and MSHA. OSHA has neither the expertise nor equipment to perform respirator performance testing. OSHA intends that information generated in this proceeding will be made available to NIOSH to use in its revision of its respirator certification standards, and that NIOSH will make its rulemaking record available to OSHA. OSHA believes that, for the present, the best course is to continue to require NIOSH respirator certification as it has in the past.**VI. Summary of the Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and Environmental Impact Assessment**Executive Order 12866 requires that a regulatory impact assessment be conducted for any rule having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affecting in a material way the economy, sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, or state, local or tribal governments. In addition, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-353, 94 Stat. 1164 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.)) requires the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to determine whether a proposed regulation will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and the National Environmental Policy (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.) requires the agency to assess the environmental consequences of regulatory actions.In order to properly assess potential impacts, in 1988 OSHA prepared a Preliminary Regulatory Impact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (PRIA) for the proposed revisions to the respiratory protection standard. This analysis includes a profile of the affected industries, the estimated number of workers who wear respirators, and the nonregulatory alternatives, technological feasibility, costs, benefits, and an overall economic impact of the proposed standard. The PRIA is available in the OSHA Docket Office. OSHA believes the basic data and conclusions are still correct. Inflation has increased costs but has generally increased profits and sales in reasonably similar proportions. This assessment is largely based upon the conclusions of the PRIA; cost numbers have been adjusted for inflation.The primary sources of information used for this impact analysis are a report by Centaur Associates, Inc. entitled, \"Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis of Alternative Respiratory Protection Standards\" and a report by Centaur Associates, Inc. entitled, \"Compliance Cost Analysis: Current and Proposed Respiratory Protection Standards\", available in the docket. Most of the information contained in this report was collected from an in-depth sample survey of the current work practices in 2,300 manufacturing plants in which respirators are used. The results from the manufacturing sector were extrapolated to nonmanufacturing plants and construction firms.A third source of data are the comments received by OSHA in response to the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR). OSHA welcomes additional comments and all information supplied will be carefully reviewed and evaluated for incorporation into the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) that will accompany the final rule.Industries and Employees AffectedThe data currently available to OSHA indicate that the proposed standard would affect approximately 3.6 million employees of whom 1.6 million are employed in the manufacturing sector, 1.5 million are employed in the nonmanufacturing sector, and 0.5 million are employed in the construction sector. Of the 3.0 million employees who wear respirators for routine or occasional work, 1.1 million use respirators routinely and 1.9 million use respirators occasionally. About 600,000 employees wear respirators for both routine and emergency use. Of these 600,000 employees, approximately 150,000 wear respirators only for emergencies. Respirators are used routinely or occasionally in about 606,200 establishments of which 123,200 are manufacturing plants, 360,100 are nonmanufacturing plants, and 122,900 are construction sites. Respirators are also used only for emergencies in another 51,800 establishments, of which 15,200 are manufacturing plants, 27,300 are nonmanufacturing plants, and 9,300 areconstruction sites. Each general industry and construction sector would be affected by this proposed standard because respirators are used in many different work activities in each of these sectors.In general, worker compensation systems designed to compensate employees for occupationally related illnesses have not had a significant impact upon the incidence of long-term chronic occupational illnesses. One reason is that it is extremely difficult to determine the cause of illness at the time the disease is diagnosed. The long latency period between the exposure and the onset of disease, and the mobility of employees among occupations and firms combine to make it difficult to establish a direct causal relationship between an occupational exposure and the resultant illness. The absence of a readily observable cause and effect relationship provides a disincentive for some firms to establish appropriate safety and health measures. In addition, the lack of information regarding health risks, inadequate training, or a misunderstanding of the function of a respirator may lead to employee exposure to harmful levels of hazardous substances. Thus, the nonregulatory environment does notguarantee employee safety because the economic incentives are absent, employees are improperly trained in respirator use, and employees do not have sufficient information on the resultant benefits of respirator use.The proposed respirator standard does not require the use of large- scale capital equipment. All of the provisions involve equipment, evaluations, and work practices that are widely used. Thus, on the basis of the information currently available, the proposed standard has been found to be technologically feasible. Additional information that is submitted will be carefully evaluated by OSHA before issuing the final rule.Summary of CostOSHA derived its cost estimates by first examining the cost of coming into compliance with both the existing and proposed standards, using current work practices as its baseline. This estimate does not include the cost of purchasing the respirators; it includes only the cost of all the other activities required by the existing and proposed respiratory protection programs. The requirement to wear respirators comes from other standards or specific conditions -- not from this standard. Consequently, respirator purchase has been costed in other standards which require their use. This standard requires improvements in the respirator program when other standards require their use and this analysis costs these additional program requirements.OSHA estimates that the total annualized incremental cost of the proposed revisions to the respirator standard are $106.8 million. As shown in Table A, approximately half of this cost ($55.6) is estimated to fall on the nonmanufacturing sector, with the remainder in manufacturing ($38.2) and construction ($13.1). The largest incremental cost is attributable to enhanced requirements for qualitative fit testing ($58.5 million). Other enhanced requirements include provisions dealing with disposable respirator practices ($16.7 million), respirator facepiece selection ($15.2 million), employee training ($14.4 million) and respirator use in IDLH atmospheres ($10.4 million).In reviewing the original standard, some provisions were considered to impose costs on employers without providing safety, and have been modified. Cost savings would be derived from modified requirements regarding air quality in atmosphere-supplying respirators ($8 million) and eyeglass mounts ($0.4 million). These estimates are conservative, as they do not factor in savings to employers already in compliance with existing provisions.While the proposed standard clarifies a number of existing requirements, several of them were judged in the PRIA not to actually impose a new burden on employers. However, the respirator survey found significant noncompliance with several provisions of the existing standard, and by extension, the proposed standard. Costs relating to compliance with these provisions is discussed in depth in the PRIA.**Table A. -- Annualized Costs of Proposed Revisions  to Respirator Standard (Millions $1992)(1)****Manufacturing** | **Non- manufacturing** | **Construction** | **Total**  Medical | $0.0 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $0.0  Qualitative Fit Testing  (with protocols) | 17.3 | 33.0 | 8.1 | 58.5  Employee Training | 5.7 | 6.6 | 2.1 | 14.4  Program Administrator Training | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0  Written Procedures | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0  Program Administration and Respirator Maintenance | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0  Storage | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0  Eyeglass Mounts | -0.2 | -0.1 | -0.0 | -0.4  Poor Warning Properties | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0  Respirator Use in IDLH(2) Atmospheres | 6.6 | 3.2 | 0.7 | 10.4  Air Quality in Atmosphere-Supplying Respirators | -4.2 | -3.1 | -0.7 | -8.0  Disposable Respirator Practices | 9.4 | 5.6 | 1.7 | 16.7  Respirator Facepiece Selection | 3.6 | 10.4 | 1.2 | 15.2  **Total** | 38.2 | 55.6 | 13.1 | 106.8  Footnote(1) Represents incremental burden over existing standard; numbers may not add precisely due to roundingFootnote(2) Immediately dangerous to life and healthSource: U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA, Office of Regulatory AnalysisThe proper use of a respirator when augmented by an appropriate respiratory protection program can prevent fatalities and illnesses from both acute and chronic exposures to hazardous substances. Based on data found in the OSHA Integrated Management Information System (IMIS), OSHA determined that there is an annual average of 66,500 illnesses that are due to acute exposures to airborne hazardous substances. OSHA estimated that compliance with the existing standard could have prevented about 20 percent of these incidents, and that the proposed revisions to the existing standard could prevent an additional 5 to 10 percent. Thus, full compliance with proposed revisions to the existing standard could prevent between 3,325 and 6,650 illnesses due to acute exposures annually.In addition, using an Office of Technology Assessment estimate that 5 percent of all cancers are occupationally related, OSHA estimated that there are annually between 9,085 and 15,660 new cancer cases, between 6,850 and 11,000 cancer deaths, due to chronic exposures to occupational airborne carcinogens. In addition, airborne exposure to hazardous substances such as silica are estimated to account for another 4,200 chronic illnesses annually. OSHA anticipates that full compliance with the existing standard would prevent about 10 percent of these cases, and that proposed revisions to the existing standard would prevent an additional 2.5 to 5 percent. Thus, after a period of time, between 227 and 783 new cancer cases, between 171 and 550 cancer fatalities, and between 105 and 210 chronic illnesses could be prevented each year by full compliance with the proposed revisions to the respirator standard.OSHA requests public comment on these benefits estimates in general and the methodology used in making them. The agency requests comment on how much an effective respiratory protection program, as proposed, would reduce the level of occupational illness currently found. In addition, information and data are requested on current respirator use patterns as related to exposure (i.e. percentage of respirator users with potential exposures at levels up to 10 times the PEL; 50 times the PEL, etc.) and any anticipated impact this proposed standard would have on respirator use.Economic Impact and FeasibilityIn assessing the economic feasibility of the respirator standard, the Agency examined the costs of compliance of the standard, in relation to sales and profits in affected industries. This analysis was based on data in the 1986 Centaur report for manufacturing, and on industry profile information from OSHA's 1989 PPE survey and 1992 Dun and Bradstreet financial data.OSHA assessed the potential economic impacts and has preliminarily determined that the standard is economically feasible for each of the major industry groups that will be affected. OSHA conducted its analysis at the two-digit SIC level. This has been OSHA's procedure for doing regulatory impact analyses for other proposed standards. OSHA preliminarily concludes that this is reflective of the actual impact on the average firm within each subsector. It does not appear that the affected groups will experience significant adverse economic impact as a result of the standard. However, if any interested person has information to show that the analysis at the two-digit level is not representative of the potential economic impact of the proposal, OSHA requests the following information: reasons why the preliminary regulatory impact analysis is not reflective of the actual anticipated costs in any particular sector; specific information as to why the analysis at the two-digit level fails toadequately represent the economic impact; and specific information to help OSHA to better predict the impact on the sector in question. Such information should be included in the comments on the proposal.As indicated in Table B, OSHA estimates that for all affected industries, incremental costs of compliance would amount to less than 0.1 percent of sales, meaning that less than a 0.1 percent increase in prices would be necessary to cover these costs. At this level, businesses should have no trouble passing these costs onto consumers, as it is unlikely consumers would notice the difference, in the face of other market fluctuations. Even if this were somehow not possible, in the worst case, any reduction in profits would be less than 1% in any industry. For these reasons, the Agency anticipates the standard should be economically feasible in all industries.The Agency invites comment by any industries that anticipate problems with economic feasibility in complying with these revisions to the respirator standard.**Table B. -- Cost of Revisions to Respirator  Standard as a Percentage of Sales and Profits****SIC** | **Industry** | **Costs per establish- ment** | **Sales per establish- ment** | **Pre-tax profits per establish- ment** | **Costs/ sales (percent)** | **Costs/ profits (percent)**  07 | Agricultural Services | $73 | $316,434 | 29,249 | 0.023 | 0.25  08 | Forestry | 116 | 613,039 | 73,941 | .019 | .16  13 | Oil & Gas Extraction | 117 | 14,732,157 | 1,406,260 | .001 | .01  15 |  |  |  |  |  |  16 |  |  |  |  |  |  17 | Construction | 107 | 895,587 | 42,998 | .012 | .25  22 | Textile Mill Products | 2,409 | 8,344,061 | 467,815 | .029 | .52  24 | Lumber & Wood Products | 151 | 3,152,807 | 186,290 | .005 | .08  25 | Furniture & Fixtures | 325 | 1,710,553 | 94,173 | .019 | .34  26 | Paper & Allied Products | 721 | 3,359,030 | 196,804 | .021 | .37  28 | Chemicals & Allied Products | 627 | 22,228,880 | 1,234,883 | .003 | .05  29 | Petroleum Refining | 173 | 2,235,435 | 169,352 | .008 | .10  30 | Rubber & Misc.

There may, however, be a higher cost per respirator-wearing-employee for some small entities. In particular, larger plants that have in-house testing facilities and in-house medical facilities would be able to provide the necessary services at lower unit costs than could smaller companies. OSHA is soliciting information on this issue, and any comments received will be carefully reviewed and evaluated for incorporation into the RIA of the final rule.Environmental Impact Assessment -- Finding of No Significant ImpactThe proposed rule and its alternatives have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.), the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR Part 1500), and the Department of Labor's (DOL's) NEPA Procedures (29 CFR Part 11). As a result of this review, the Assistant Secretary for OSHA determined that the proposed rule will have no significant environmental impact.The focus of the proposed standard is on reducing risks to employees who must wear respiratory protection in order to reduce their exposures to hazardous airborne substances when effective engineering controls are not feasible, while they are being installed, or during emergencies. The proposed provisions include written respiratory protection programs and evaluation, medical evaluation, fit-testing procedures, guidance on the maintenance, care, and use of respirators, and training. The implementation of the respirator program would remove hazardous airborne particulates and contaminants from the breathing zone of the worker and not from the general ambient atmosphere in the work environment. In general, the procedures and applications of the proposed provisions do not impact on air, water or soil quality, plant or animal life, the use of land, or other aspects of the environment and therefore are not anticipated to have any significant effect on the environment.**VII. Summary and Explanation of the Proposed Standard**In developing the proposed standard, OSHA received and analyzed all of the regulations, documents, and comments described above, as well as other information the Agency has obtained during the developmental process. This information can be found in the public record, Docket H-049. The material collected and reviewed generally supports OSHA's finding that in order to ensure adequate respiratory protection, employers requiring employees to wear respirators must develop and maintain an appropriate respiratory protection program.Setting clear protective requirements for selecting, fitting, using, and maintaining respiratory protective devices will help employers to provide the appropriate protection for their employees, and thus reduce their exposure to hazardous chemicals.This proposal is intended to replace OSHA's current respiratory protection standard for general industry, 29 CFR 1910.134, and the respiratory protection provisions in the OSHA construction standards, 29 CFR 1926, and maritime standards, 29 CFR 1915-1918. Although a performance standard orientation has been adopted, enforcement experience with the current standard has shown that the existing requirements do not provide sufficient specific information for employers to comply, particularly in the areas of respirator selection, medical surveillance, and fit testing. Therefore, this proposal is designed to provide employers with a clear description of the appropriate steps to follow to establish an effective respiratory protection program.OSHA recognizes that there may be differing opinions regarding the particular provisions that should be included in such a comprehensive respiratory protection standard. The Agency is hereby soliciting information on alternative requirements to address the problems of inadequate or improper respiratory protection. The final standard adopted will incorporate whatever means are best for ensuring an effective respiratory protection program and which are supported by the public rulemaking record. The proposed standard continues the public rulemaking process by presenting the Agency's assessment of the best method to accomplish the development and maintenance of a respiratory protection program given our current state of knowledge.The following summary and explanation is designed to clarify the intent of the proposed provisions, as well as to identify issues OSHA is aware of and would like to receive comments on. Comments are also invited on other relevant issues which are not specifically raised in this discussion. All such comments should clearly identify the provision of the standard to which they apply, as well as the position taken on that provision. It is most helpful, and makes the record more accessible, when comments are organized in the same order that the standard is written and are indexed to the particular provisions of the standard to which they refer. It should also be noted that on technical issues, substantiation should be presented as well as opinion on the appropriateness of a particular requirement. Such substantiation may take the form of anecdotal evidence of experience, scientific data, etc. Submission of substantive commments helps OSHA build a thorough record upon which to base the finalstandard. A complete record on all the issues will help ensure that the final standard is appropriately drawn to address the issue of respiratory protection.(A) Scope and ApplicationThe existing OSHA respirator standard contains a methods of compliance provision (Sec. 1910.134(a)(1)) which establishes a hierarchy of control techniques to be used for protecting employees from exposure to airborne contaminants, with engineering controls to be implemented first and respirators allowed only when engineering controls are not feasible or while they are being instituted.This provision of the standard is not a subject of this rulemaking; only issues relevant to the content of a respirator use program are to be addressed at this time. OSHA is reviewing Sec. 1910.134(a)(1) and similar hierarchy of controls provisions contained in Sec. 1910.1000 in a separate rulemaking.In the prepublication draft, OSHA asked whether to make the requirements for a respirator program apply whenever the employer either required or permitted the use of respirators. The requirement that the program be implemented whenever employees were permitted to wear respirators on their own was criticized by commenters (Ex. 36-11, 36-13, 36-38, 36-44, 36-47, 36-48, 36-51A) who felt that this provision was inappropriate and would serve to discourage permission to use respirators voluntarily and thus, in some situations, could lessen workplace protection. Upon consideration of these comments, OSHA is now proposing to retain the wording in paragraph (a)(2) of the current standard which requires that respirators be provided when such equipment is necessary to protect the health of the employee.Paragraph (a)(2) actually addresses two issues -- (1) when respirators are required to be used and (2) that of the need to implement a full respiratory protection program. Regarding when respirators are required to be used, OSHA interprets paragraph (a)(2) as clearly requiring their use in the absence of engineering controls whenever employee exposures would exceed an OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL) or warrant a 5(a)(1) citation under the OSH Act. Under these conditions, the proposal would require respirators to be provided by the employer and a respiratory protection program that meets the full requirements of the respirator standard to be implemented. This interpretation continues OSHA's existing compliance policy covering the required use of respirators.A respiratory protection program complying with the full provisions of this proposal would be required whenever an employer requires any employee to wear a respirator, regardless of the exposure level and whether the substance is regulated. The use of a respirator in itself could constitute a hazard and improper use of a respirator can also increase the exposure hazards and in some cases can make the exposures more dangerous than if the respirator had not been used in the first place.However, OSHA requests comments on whether the respirator program, when required by the employer in the absence of a regulatory requirement of another standard, could be modified for certain respirator types, uses, or conditions, to still provide the needed protection. Comments with supporting data are requested on what specific provisions of the proposal could be reduced or eliminated in this case based on respirator type or environmental or workplace conditions, and under what specific circumstances the required provisions could be changed.If a respirator is used by an employee but its use is not required by OSHA standards or statute, or by the employer, which is known as a voluntary respirator use situation, then the requirements of the proposed standard, although recommended, are not proposed to be mandatory.OSHA is also seeking comment on the appropriateness of the scope of the beyond required respirator use to include voluntary respirator use situations as well.OSHA requests comments on whether there are certain low risk respirator use situations which could justify the reduction or elimination of certain provisions in the mandatory respirator program in order to provide additional compliance flexibility. How such lower risk situations could be defined, and which provisions could be modified or eliminated should be listed along with a discussion of how changing the provisions would effect potential risks of respirator use.The proposal contains a threshold of five hours of respirator wear in any work week before a medical evaluation must be obtained. Is a five hour threshold appropriate, or should it be larger, and if so, what specific situations would serve to justify a larger time threshold? Should there be any time limit, or should any respirator use trigger medical provisions?The proposed standard includes a number of definitions which are unique, and which should be consulted to properly understand the standard. The current respiratory protection standard has no definitions, which may have contributed to misunderstandings in knowing how to comply.A number of the definitions deal with specific types of respiratory protective devices, or with components of those devices. For example, \"air-purifying respirator\", \"disposable respirator\", \"filter\", and \"positive pressure respirator\" are all defined in this paragraph. Most of these definitions are based on generally recognized sources, such as the current ANSI standard, or documents from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Others have been developed by OSHA for purposes of this standard. With the few exceptions discussed in the following paragraphs, the definitions are straight forward and self-explanatory. OSHA invites comment on the appropriateness of these definitions and invites the submission of alternatives. Some of the definitions require explanation as follows.A definition for \"hazardous exposure level\" has been developed and included for the following purpose. In order to select a respirator which provides the proper degree of protection, it is necessary to know both the anticipated ambient airborne exposure level and the exposure that is acceptable in the breathing zone. One can then determine the extent to which the respirator must reduce the ambient exposure level. Thus in the respirator selection scheme, an exposure limit must be used to establish a goal to determine the degree of protection needed for employees exposed in a given work situation. Although this standard does not set specific exposure limits, a concept of exposure must be included in the selection criteria to be consistent with current practice.Since OSHA has permissible exposure limits established for about 600 substances, and there are thousands of hazardous substances to which employees are exposed, other sources of hazard information must be used for substances not regulated by OSHA. This does not mean that OSHA is in effect establishing permissible exposure limits for these other substances. It just means that where employers decide to use respirators to control exposure, a target exposure level must be established to determine the appropriate respirator to use. Therefore, OSHA has defined the term \"hazardous exposure level\" for purposes of selecting respirators, as follows.Where OSHA does have a PEL, it must be used. If there is no PEL for the substance, the employer must use the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for the chemical if one exists.If there is no PEL or TLV for the chemical, the employer must determine the \"hazardous exposure level\" based on available scientific information including the MSDS. In some situations, the suppliers of the chemicals may make recommendations for appropriate exposure levels based on their own experience. In any event, the employer must establish a protective goal, based on available information, in order to choose the appropriate respirator, and must be able to substantiate how that goal was chosen.It should be noted that the OSHA PEL, ACGIH TLV, and other available exposure limits are required to be reported on the material safety data sheet generated by chemical manufacturers and importers under the requirements of OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). This information should assist downstream employers in choosing respirators to protect their employees.As stated in the scope paragraph, the standard is to apply when employees are required to wear respirators to reduce their exposures to airborne concentrations of \"hazardous chemicals\" in the workplace. For purposes of this standard, \"hazardous chemical\" is defined as a substance which meets the definition of \"health hazard\" under OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). This approach helps to ensure that definitions of hazard are consistent in current OSHA standards; provides a broad scope of coverage for this standard; and incorporates a data base for employers in the form of material safety data sheets generated under the requirements of the Hazard Communication Standard.The Hazard Communication Standard defines \"health hazard\" as a substance for which there is statistically significant evidence based on at least one study conducted in accordance with established scientific principles, showing that acute or chronic health effects may occur in exposed employees. The term \"health hazard\" includes substances which are carcinogens, toxic or highly toxic agents, reproductive toxins, irritants, corrosives, sensitizers, hepatotoxins, nephrotoxins, neurotoxins, agents which act on the hematopoietic system, and agents which damage the lungs, skin, eyes or mucous membranes.OSHA notes that the definition of \"hazardous chemical\" is used here merely to target the broad range of substances which may entail respirator use. However the requirements of this proposed standard only apply when a regulated substance is being used or when an employer requires the use of a respirator for any reason. One term which is frequently used in regard to atmospheres which require respiratory protection is \"immediately dangerous to life or health\" or \"IDLH.\" Such atmospheres require the most protective types of respirators for workers. Although the term is used frequently, there has been no one accepted definition of it. In the preproposal draft of the respirator standard, OSHA defined an IDLH atmosphere as one \"where the concentration of oxygen or hazardous chemical(s) would cause a person without respiratory protection to be fatally injured or would cause irreversible or incapacitating effects on that person's health.\" In addition, the definition stated that in establishingthe IDLH for a workplace situation, the employer was to consider \"the maximum concentration of the hazardous chemical at which one could escape within ten minutes without any escape-impairing or immediate or delayed irreversible health effects\" and \"the minimum concentration of the hazardous chemical at which severe eye or respiratory irritation or other reactions would inhibit escape without injury.\" This definition was derived from the IDLH definition in the Joint NIOSH/OSHA Respirator Decision Logic. An escape time of 30 minutes was considered in the Decision Logic as the maximum permissible exposure time for escape from an IDLH atmosphere. There has always been disagreement whether the maximum escape time should be reduced to 10 minutes as OSHA recommended in the preproposal draft, or whether some other time limit such as 15 or 30 minutes should be used. Since there is no clear evidence as to what the time limit should be and just how such a limit would be used in determining anIDLH atmosphere, OSHA is proposing a less specific, but clearly protective, IDLH definition that does not refer to a maximum escape time limit, as described below.NIOSH revised its IDLH definition in the August 27, 1987 (52 FR 32413) proposed revision of the respiratory protective devices certification procedures to read:\"Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health\" (IDLH): Respiratory exposures which:(1) Pose an immediate threat of loss of life or of irreversible or delayed effects on health or;(2) Eye exposures which would prevent escape from such an atmosphere. The OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, contains an IDLH definition that reads as follows:\"IDLH\" or \"Immediately dangerous to life or health\" means an atmospheric concentration of any toxic, corrosive, or asphyxiant substance that poses an immediate threat to life or would cause irreversible or delayed adverse health effects or would interfere with an individual's ability to escape from a dangerous atmosphere.The hazardous waste IDLH definition addresses all the issues covered in the NIOSH IDLH definition and more clearly addresses asphyxiant atmospheres. OSHA has therefore chosen to adopt the hazardous waste operations IDLH definition for this respiratory protection proposal which, in addition to being most appropriate, will also assure consistency between the various OSHA standards that address IDLH atmospheres. Comment is requested on this definition of immediately dangerous to life or health, and on its appropriateness for respiratory protection standards.Since the warning properties of a gas or vapor are to be considered in the selection of an air-purifying respirator, OSHA has included a definition of what constitutes \"adequate warning properties.\" The \"adequate warning properties\" referred to in regard to respiratory protection are \"the detectable characteristics of a hazardous chemical, including odor, taste, and/or irritation effects which are detectable and persistent at concentrations at or below a hazardous exposure level and exposure at these low levels does not cause olfactory fatigue.\" This definition combines the definitions for warning properties and adequate warning properties from the preproposal draft.The definitions of \"oxygen deficient atmosphere\" and \"oxygen deficient IDLH atmosphere\" have also been changed from the definitions in the preproposal draft. An oxygen deficient atmosphere is now defined as \"an atmosphere with an oxygen content of less than 19.5% by volume at altitudes of 8000 feet or below.\" This definition retains the traditional 19.5% oxygen level as the point below which an oxygen deficient atmosphere exists. It is also consistent with the minimum oxygen content of Grade D breathing air. Above 8000 feet, an oxygen deficient atmosphere, one with an oxygen level below 19.5%, would also be considered an oxygen deficient IDLH atmosphere (see below) and the proposal treats it as such. Thus the definition for \"oxygen deficient\" does not address altitudes above 8000 feet. This change in definition will allow the use of air-purifying respirators in normal atmospheric air for altitudes up to 14,000 feet.The oxygen deficient IDLH atmosphere definition has been changed to \"an atmosphere with an oxygen content below 16% by volume at altitudes of 3000 feet or below, or below the oxygen levels specified in Table I for altitudes up to 8000 feet, or below 19.5% for altitudes above 8000 feet up to 14,000 feet.\" An oxygen content of 16% at 3000 feet of altitude corresponds to an oxygen partial pressure of 100 millimeters of mercury in the freshly inspired air in the upper portion of the lungs which is saturated with water vapor. This oxygen partial pressure is level which the ANSI Z88.2-1980 respirator standard defines as \"oxygen deficiency, immediately dangerous to life or health\". However, rather than using the calculation formula from ANSI, this proposal provides an equivalent table of the oxygen percentages for oxygen deficient atmospheres and oxygen deficient IDLH atmospheres at various altitudes for simplicity of use. The table provides a side-by-side presentation of the oxygen deficientatmosphere and oxygen deficient IDLH atmosphere levels to avoid any confusion between the two, and removes the necessity of calculating the values from a formula.At altitudes above 8000 feet up to 14,000 feet an oxygen deficient IDLH atmosphere would exist when the oxygen content in the workplace atmosphere falls below 19.5%. The respirator selection provision of the proposal require that an atmosphere-supplying respirator with auxiliary escape provision or an SCBA be used in such situations. These respirators supply the wearer with Grade D breathing air. Since the allowable oxygen content in Grade D breathing air can range from 19.5% to 23% oxygen, OSHA has chosen the 19.5% lowest allowable oxygen level for Grade D air as the level below which an oxygen deficient IDLH atmosphere would occur for altitudes above 8000 feet.OSHA requests comments and specific data on the effects of reduced oxygen content in workplace atmospheres and on the appropriateness of the \"oxygen deficient\" atmosphere and \"oxygen deficient IDLH\" atmosphere definitions contained in the proposal. Alternatives to the OSHA proposed definitions should include the physiologic basis for any changes proposed for the oxygen levels used to determine these oxygen deficient atmospheres.(C) Respiratory Protection ProgramOnce an employer has decided to use respiratory protection, a written respiratory protection program must be developed and implemented. This requirement is essentially the same as that in the existing respirator standard, 29 CFR 1910.134(b)(1), which requires that written standard operating procedures governing the selection and use of respirators be established. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that employers establish a standardized procedure for selecting, using, and maintaining respirators for each workplace where respirators will be used.The ANSI Z88.2-1980 standard for respiratory protection states that written standard operating procedures covering a complete respirator program shall be established and implemented (Ex. 10). This performance oriented requirement recognizes the need for a systematic respiratory protection program to provide for consistency in protection. The ANSI standard does not contain detailed instructions on the content of standard operating procedures, but it does describe elements of a minimally acceptable respirator program.The current OSHA respirator standard requires written standard operating procedures covering selection, use, cleaning, maintenance, inspections, emergency use, training of supervisors and respirator wearers, and recordkeeping. As part of the preliminary regulatory impact analysis for this proposal, data were collected on current respirator practices and procedures in over 2300 manufacturing plants in 15 SIC codes. This sample was extrapolated to produce estimates of respirator-related practices for about 123,200 manufacturing plants with routine and occasional respirator use. Only 25.5% of these plants are estimated to have had written standard operating procedures, and only 7.9% had procedures that addressed all seven areas specified. Over 80% of the large plants (1000 or more employees) had written procedures, while in small plants (less than 50 employees) only about 22% had written procedures. The survey showed that the intent of the existing respirator standard as well as the areasto be addressed in standard operating procedures were not clear to employers.In a review of violations of the OSHA respirator standard from 1977 to 1982, 13% of the citations were for lack of standard operating procedures (Ex. 33-5). This percentage of citations actually underrepresents the total number of cases where problems were found since it is OSHA policy not to issue citations when no overexposures were documented.A review of the comments received in response to the ANPR showed wide general support for the requirement for written standard operating procedures. Only one comment by Western Electric Co. for AT&T; (Ex. 15-51) recommended that the written program requirement be dropped. The commenter stated that while many users of respirators require written procedures for an effective protection program, OSHA should not be concerned about written procedures, but only about the overall effectiveness of the respirator program. There were several submissions that supported the existing written standard operating procedure requirement (Ex. 15-37, 15-42, 15-50, 15-56, 15-77) and recommended that OSHA make no significant changes. However, OSHA's compliance experience shows that there is a need to clarify the intent of the requirement and make it clear to employers what OSHA expects in a written respiratory protection program.Several ANPR commenters felt OSHA should not include detailed specifications in the requirement for written standard operating procedures (Ex. 15-13, 15-22, 15-30, 15-55, 15-73, 15-75). Some felt the requirement should be written in performance language, with the specific contents of the procedures to be left to the employer (Ex. 15-26, 15-41, 15-44, 15-52, 15-70, 15-76). The ANSI Z88.2-1980 specifications were considered adequate and were recommended by still others (Ex. 15-14, 15-31, 15-33, 15-35, 15-46, 15-58). Certain commenters presented lists of recommended elements to be covered where appropriate in the procedures (Ex. 15-18, 15-19, 15-22, 15-34, 15-53, 15-81). These recommended areas for coverage in the written standard operating procedures varied slightly among the commenters, but the major areas of respirator inspection, cleaning, maintenance, selection, training, use, fit testing, recordkeeping and program evaluation were common to most of the lists. Others recommended OSHAuse the program specification in the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) respirator training program or in the NIOSH guide to respiratory protection (Ex. 15-27A, 15-81). The AIHA (Ex. 15-81) also stated that the standard operating procedures should be more specific in defining employer/ employee responsibilities and the types of respirators required for specific jobs.Written standard operating procedures are essential to an effective respiratory protection program. Developing and writing down standard operating procedures requires employers to think through just how all of the requirements of the respiratory protection standard will be met in their workplace. The current respirator standard requires that employers develop written standard operating procedures that include all information and guidance necessary for respirator selection, use, and care, along with written procedures covering safe use of respirators in dangerous atmospheres that might be encountered in normal operations or emergencies. The proposal in section (c) contains additional descriptions of the elements to be included in the written standard operating procedures to provide additional guidance for employers. The requirement is performance oriented since the proposal does not contain detailed specifications for the required written standard operating procedures. The list ofelements to be covered is similar to those contained in the ANSI Z88.2-1980 standard, and includes many of the recommended elements presented by commenters to the preproposal draft (Ex. 15-18, 15-19, 15-22, 15-34, 15-53, 15-81). The specific contents of the procedures are left to the employer who can tailor them to match the many varied situations that can occur. Many of the elements will be common to all respiratory protection programs, such as respirator selection, care, use, training, and program evaluation. Some elements such as air quality with supplied air respirators are required only when those types of respirators are used.The elements of the standard operating procedures are part of the mandatory provisions of the proposal. Listing the requirements in a non-mandatory appendix, as was suggested, would perpetuate a recognized problem area. The current standard fails to clearly identify the areas to be covered in the written standard operating procedures, and as a result only a quarter of the written procedures that were surveyed addressed all the needed elements (Ex. 33-5). Placing the elements in a non-mandatory appendix would encourage the continuance of current practice in writing standard operating procedures. The problem is not only poorly written procedures, but failure to address some of the necessary elements at all. Only by making the required elements mandatory and enforceable can an improvement in written standard operating procedures and thus an overall program be assured.Employers are required by the proposal to designate a person qualified by training and/or experience in the proper selection, use, and maintenance of respirators to be responsible for implementing the respirator protection program, and for conducting the periodic evaluations of its effectiveness. This requirement is similar to that in the ANSI standard (Ex. 10) which requires that responsibility and authority for the respirator program be assigned to a single qualified person with sufficient knowledge of respirator protection to properly supervise the program. The OSHA standard is performance oriented since it allows the employer to choose the person best qualified for the assignment.The training requirements of the respirator program supervisors was the subject of a question in the ANPR. Several ANPR commenters said that specifying the type of training required would be beyond the scope of the standard (Ex. 15-13, 15-35, 15-75, 15-75A, 15-75c). Others recommended OSHA adopt the performance language of the ANSI standard (Ex. 15-26, 15-31, 15-38). Still others recommended that the supervisor be under the direction of an industrial hygienist or safety professional (Ex. 15-55, 15-70, 15-76). Some wanted the level of training required to be commensurate with the complexity of the program and the degree of risk. (Ex. 15-18, 15-37, 15-46, 15-47, 15-59). Most, however, recommended that OSHA require the supervisor to have knowledge of respirators equivalent to that obtained from taking the NIOSH occupational respiratory protection course. (Ex. 15-30, 15-33, 15-41, 15-42, 15-52, 15-53, 15-54, 15-58, 15-62, 15-71, 15-73).Specifying in detail the type and extent of training required for program supervisors has not been done in this proposal. The level of training that would be appropriate for a workplace with limited respirator use would be quite different from that required at another workplace with extensive respirator use that includes IDLH atmospheres, highly toxic chemicals, or other complex respirator use operations. Therefore, OSHA has adopted a performance language provision for program supervisor training that is similar to the ANSI standard requirement. The level of training for the respirator program supervisor must be adequate to deal with the complexity of the respirator program. OSHA has not established any one training program, such as the NIOSH respirator course, as the level of training program supervisors must achieve. The NIOSH course covers many different respirator types and uses, and may provide too much information on certain types of respirators such as SCBAs for programsupervisors who run simple programs, yet not provide enough information for respirator program supervisors with a highly complex respirator program. The program supervisor can also use the assistance of industrial hygienists, safety professionals, or other respirator experts to help run the respirator program. Therefore, the training requirements for respirator program supervisors have been written in performance language, to allow the training requirements to fit the needs of the respirator program.A number of commenters on the preproposal draft addressed the issue of program administration. Only the American Textile Manufacturer's Institute (Ex. 36-18) felt the requirement that a person be designated to administer the respiratory protection program should be deleted. Other commenters supported the requirement (Ex. 36-14, 36-31, 36-36, 36-40, 36-44, 36-47). The training requirements for the program administrator was also the subject of comments. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Ex. 36-31) recommended that both training and 6 to 12 months field experience in using respirators should be required. Lawrence Durio (Ex. 36-36) recommended that the person responsible for the respirator protection program be a certified industrial hygienist or complete a NIOSH sponsored course in respiratory protection designed specifically for the training of respiratory protection program managers. Richard Boggs of ORC (Ex. 36-47) recommended that the qualifications of the administrator reflect thecomplexity of the respirator program. California/OSHA (Ex. 36-44) recommended that all program administers at least have demonstrable knowledge of the requirements of 1910.134 and where respirators may be used for entry into IDLH atmospheres, the program administrator must attend the NIOSH respirator course or equivalent. Donald Rapp of the Dow Chemical Company (Ex. 36-40) recommended that OSHA allow a committee as well as an individual to be the responsible party, since a committee is more likely to be responsible for the program than an individual in larger companies. ORC (Ex. 36-47) also recommended that OSHA allow responsibility to be vested in an individual or in a committee/ department designated as the central authority.To assure that the integrity of the respiratory protection program is maintained through the continuous oversight of one responsible individual, the proposal requires that a qualified person be designated as responsible for the management and administration of the program. That individual can work with a committee or assign responsibility for portions of the program to other personnel, but the overall responsibility for the operation of the program remains with the designated person. This approach promotes coordination of all facets of the program. The training requirement for the program administrator has been left performance oriented. With the varying complexity of respirator programs, specifying a uniform training requirement would be very difficult. The level of training required varies with the complexity of the respirator program. OSHA invites further comments on whether specific minimum training requirements for program administrators should be set, and on what the trainingEmployers are required to keep the written respiratory protection program current. The preproposal draft required that the written respiratory protection program be maintained \"in a current fashion.\" The Motor Vehicle Manufacturer's Association (Ex. 36-37) recommended that the phrase \"in a current fashion\" be deleted since requiring that the employer maintain the written program implies that it be maintained in a current fashion. In order to clarify the intent of the provision the phrase \"in a current fashion\" has been removed and the wording has been revised to require that the employer maintain a written respiratory protection program that reflects current workplace conditions and respirator use. As the workplace situation or respirator use changes, the program is to be revised. Also the program must be made available, upon request, to employees, designated representatives and to OSHA.(D) Selection of RespiratorsThe existing OSHA respiratory standard does not contain specific guidance for the selection of respirators. Instead, the standard requires that the selection of respirators be made according to the guidance of the American National Standard, Practices for Respirator Protection Z88.2-1969. The 1969 ANSI standard recommended appropriate respirators for use with various categories of contaminants, but did not attempt to set individual protection levels for each type of respirator. Although the ANSI standard was revised in 1980, the current ANSI committee (Ex. 36-55) considered the 1980 standard to be obsolete and was in the process of developing another revision with provisions that differ substantially from the 1980 version. A consensus on a revised 1992 ANSI standard was not reached by ANSI during the time of the original OSHA rulemaking comment periods. Therefore there were no substantive comments received by OSHA on the provisions of the revised 1992 ANSI respiratory protectionstandard. However, as discussed later, OSHA has reviewed the new ANSI standard and has given it thorough consideration in the preparation of the final OSHA proposed standard.The joint NIOSH/OSHA respiratory decision logic, originally published in 1975, was an early attempt to develop a logic for respirator selection that could easily be followed and would enable an individual to pick the appropriate respirator consistently. OSHA believes that changes in respirator technology and new data on respirator fit and protection levels have rendered this early decision logic, as well as the 1980 ANSI standard obsolete, and rules for selection are essential to avoid the risk of using respirators which are incapable of providing the necessary protection. The current OSHA standard lacks such rules, and an analysis of enforcement experience (Ex. 33-5) shows that as a result, the selection of inappropriate or unapproved respirators and failure to provide suitable respiratory protection accounted for 26% of the violations of the respirator standard cited during fiscal years 1977 to 1982.The proposal requires employers to provide respiratory protection at no cost to employees. This is consistent with the provisions of the current respiratory protection standard, as well as with the OSH Act, to ensure that employers provide whatever controls are necessary to protect employees from hazards generated by the work operation.Where elastomeric facepieces are to be used, the employer shall provide a selection of respirators from an assortment of at least three sizes for each type of facepiece from at least two manufacturers. Comments were received stating that the cost of maintaining three different sizes of two manufacturer's respirators would appear excessive if only one or two employees require a respirator (Ex. 36-32). Others indicated that the assortment should be required for the initial fit (Ex. 36-28, 36-36) but not for the annual retest since each fit test respirator must be cleaned before its next use. OSHA is maintaining in this proposal the requirement for an assortment of respirators for both the initial and annual fit tests. OSHA believes that nothing in the course of respirator use is more important than achieving the best possible fitting respirator and that this is only possible where an adequate selection is available. Availability of different sizes and types of respirators duringretesting is especially critical where the employee's physical conditions may have changed as the result of a modest weight change or changed facial configuration due to surgery or dental work, which may affect respirator fit.2\\. Workplace ConditionsThe first step in selecting respirators for a particular workplace is to consider available information concerning workplace conditions and characteristics of the hazardous chemical. The proposal lists eleven such categories of information.(i) Nature of the hazard. The nature of the hazard, whether it is in the form of a gas, dust, organic vapor, fume, mist, oxygen deficiency, or any combination of hazards needs to be taken into account.(ii) Physical and chemical properties of the air contaminant. The physical and chemical properties that affect respirator selection such as particle size for dusts, vapor pressure, breakthrough times, and the ability of the filter material to remove, adsorb, or absorb the contaminant.(iii) The adverse health effects of the respiratory hazard. In selecting a respirator any adverse physiological effects that may occur from exposure to the hazard, including effects that may occur due to respirator leaks or failure need to be considered.(iv) The relevant permissible exposure limit or recommended exposure limit. The OSHA permissible exposure limit, or in its absence, any American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists recommended Threshold Limit Value (TLV), NIOSH recommended exposure limit, or other exposure limit set by the employer must be considered in selecting the appropriate respirator.(v) The results of workplace sampling of airborne concentrations of contaminants. Sampling and analysis of the workplace air determines what degree of exposure is occurring, and thus what degree of protection is required. Where such sampling and analysis have been done, the results are to be used as a point of comparison for the hazardous exposure level i.e. to determine how much the concentration must be lowered by the respirator to reduce employee exposure to a safe level.(vi) Nature of the work operation or process. The type of job operation, the equipment or tools that will be used, and any motion or travel the job requires can influence the type of respirator selected. For example, in the case where respirators are used to protect employees who are spray painting or working at an open surface tank, the type of operation can affect the type of respirator selected, particularly if supplied air respirators, which require a connection to a clean air source, are used.(vii) Time period respirator is worn. The employer must also consider the period of time during which the respirator will be used by employees during a work shift. Breakthrough times for different chemicals can vary greatly, and are dependent on the concentrations found in the workplace. A respirator that provides adequate protection for one chemical may be inadequate for another chemical with a different breakthrough time. In addition, employees wearing respirators for longer periods of time may need different types of respirators for more comfortable wear.(viii) Work activities and stress. The work activities of employees while wearing respirators are also a factor. Heavy work that is physically draining may affect an employee's capability of wearing certain types of respirators.Temperature and humidity conditions in the workplace may also affect the stress level associated with wearing a respirator as well as the effectiveness of respirator filters and cartridges. These types of factors must be assessed in selecting the appropriate equipment for a particular work situation.(ix) Fit testing. The proposal includes requirements for fit testing. The results of these tests are to be used in the selection process. Some employees may be unable to achieve an adequate fit with certain respirator models or a particular type of respirator -- such as half mask air-purifying respirators -- so an alternative respirator model with an adequate fit or other type of respirator that provides adequate protection must be used. Fit test results must be used to determine when this is the case and what alternative respirator should be selected.(x) Warning properties. The warning properties of a hazardous gas or vapor must also be considered when selecting a respirator. When using an air purifying respirator the odor, taste, or irritation effects of the substance present should have a threshold concentration low enough so that the substance can be detected before health effects can occur. Also, the detection threshold should be low enough that olfactory fatigue with subsequent loss of the warning properties of the chemical cannot occur. This subject is discussed in more detail under section 5 below.(xi) Physical characteristics, functional capabilities, and limitations of respirators. The last category of information to be considered when selecting respiratory protection is the physical characteristics, functional capabilities, and limitations of the respiratory protection equipment itself. For example, airline respirators should not be used by mobile employees around moving machinery unless entanglement of airlines in equipment is easily avoided.Once the employer has determined what respirator types are appropriate for the workplace, respirators must be selected from among those approved and certified according to 42 CFR Part 84 by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) when such respirators exist.3\\. Use of NIOSH/MSHA Certified Respiratorsa. Alternatives. Alternatives to requiring that NIOSH/MSHA certified respirators be used are limited. Several ANPR commenters stated that OSHA should allow the use of non-approved respirators for which scientifically valid test data are available (Ex. 15-11, 15-38, 15-45, 15-53, 15-54, 15-55, 15-56, 15-58, 15-81), where the respirators were tested by independent laboratories (Ex. 15-10, 15-53) or where the manufacturer has sound test data (Ex. 15-10, 15-19, 15-53, 15-62, 15-73). Others insisted that OSHA should not accept respirator certification from any source other than NIOSH/MSHA (Ex. 15-14, 15-34, 15-46, 15-48, 15-70, 15-75A, 15-77). OSHA regards all such suggestions as having serious flaws.Independent certification laboratories for respirators do not yet exist. An extensive commitment of money and resources would be required by any private organization establishing such a testing system. Some believe that if OSHA allows certification of respirators by independent laboratories, this will encourage the development of such systems. However, it would be very difficult to write a provision allowing independent certification systems when none now exist. Developing the respirator test protocols such independent laboratories would use would involve a considerable level of effort and would duplicate the revision efforts already underway by NIOSH to revise the respirator certification standards. Moreover it would be necessary to establish a program to certify the testing laboratories as well. The Agency does not presently have the means to accomplish such assessments, and in fact, does not have the personnel or resources to become certifiers of respirators.OSHA is therefore proposing to maintain the requirement that NIOSH approved respirators be used when such respirators exist. For OSHA compliance purposes, a respirator certification program is necessary in order to assure that respirators used in industry are capable of providing the needed protection. OSHA recognizes that there are problems with the existing NIOSH/MSHA certification program. Several of the comments OSHA received were related to problems with NIOSH/MSHA respirator certification, including the issue of modifications to respirators, interchanging of respirator parts and the use of respirators for which NIOSH has not yet granted approval. Since these problem areas are being addressed by NIOSH during its revision of the respirator certification program under the new 42 CFR 84, it is inappropriate for OSHA to try to correct problems with the present NIOSH/MSHA regulations in the revised OSHA respirator standard.b. Approval for modified respirators. Several commenters suggested that OSHA should not automatically reject the use of approved respirators that have modifications (Ex. 15-10, 15-19, 15-22, 15-26, 15-31, 15-40, 15-41, 15-45, 15-46, 15-52, 15-54, 15-55, 15-56, 15-62, 15-75c). Modifications could include interchange of parts, canisters, air hoses, etc. These modifications would have to be evaluated, whether through testing to demonstrate comparable protection and reliability (Ex. 15-10, 15-22, 15-31, 15-38, 15-46, 15-50, 15-52, 15-53, 15-54, 15-55, 15-62, 15-73, 15-75c, 15-81), by requiring that modifications be done under the auspices of NIOSH (Ex. 15-18, 15-33, 15-38, 15-76), or by allowing minor modifications if approved by a certified industrial hygienist (Ex. 15-73). OSHA believes that NIOSH is the appropriate Agency to consider this issue and that such consideration should be part of the certification process.OSHA also believes that the proposed 42 CFR Part 84 is the proper forum in which to resolve any problems with respirator modifications. Therefore, this proposal does not change OSHA's general policy of rejecting modifications to approved respirators.OSHA invites comment on the question of whether to require NIOSH approval for the respirators selected, and on alternatives to this requirement, including practical considerations of compliance and enforcement.c. Use of non-approved respirators. Several commenters on the preproposal draft recommended that OSHA establish procedures for permitting the use of non-approved respirators. (Ex. 36-22, 36-28, 36-29, 36-30, 36-36, 36-41, 36-44, 36-45, 36-47, 36-51A, 36-52, 36-53). As was pointed out, there are types of respiratory protection, such as supplied air suits for which no NIOSH/MSHA approval schedule currently exists (Ex. 36-28, 36-29, 36-36, 36-52, 36-53). California OSHA (Ex. 36-44) recommended that OSHA add wording that would give OSHA the ability to approve respirators that do not have a NIOSH/MSHA approval schedule. The Industrial Safety Equipment Association (Ex. 36-45) stated that OSHA should allow the use of non-approved respirators if data are available to show that they operate satisfactorily. The AIHA (Ex. 36-41) also recommended that if an employer can demonstrate effective, safe utilization of a device, then its use should be permitted. The American Petroleum Institute (Ex.36-51A) requested that OSHA permit the use of non-approved respirators when OSHA accepts these devices based on a case-by-case evaluation of evidence provided by the employer or manufacturer. They also stated that this method had worked well in the past for acrylonitrile, mercury, fluorides and vinyl chloride.While it is true that OSHA has in the past approved the use of certain unapproved respirators, this approval has generally been as the result of a thorough review of the respirators capabilities as part of a substance specific standard. OSHA does not have the personnel or facilities to perform respirator testing, and has no present plans to set itself up as a respirator approval agency. Therefore, this proposed respirator standard does not contain language which would formalize a procedure for approving respirators. OSHA invites comment on whether and how such an approval procedure should be added to the standard.4\\. Assigned Protection FactorsThe proposal requires that respirators be selected in accordance with the respirator selection tables in the NIOSH proposed revision of the tests and requirements for certification of respiratory protective devices (42 CFR Part 84). The protection factor concept has developed over the years since OSHA adopted its current standards. It is a recognition of the fact that different types of equipment provide different degrees of protection, and equipment limitations must be considered in selecting respirators.Three commenters in response to the preproposal draft recommended that OSHA allow the use of other selection guidelines in addition to those in the preproposal draft Appendix A. Motorola (Ex. 36-22) stated that there was great controversy over the assigned protection factors, and in order to maintain a performance standard approach OSHA should allow the use of not only the respirator selection tables but the ANSI Z 88.2 selection tables, or other guidelines published and peer reviewed by other consensus groups or professional associations. Homestake Mining (Ex. 36-30) had a similar recommendation, maintaining that it would allow the employer to use the latest and best information for respirator selection. They also recommended that a provision be added to require that employers demonstrate and support their rationale for using values other than those in the respirator selection tables. The AIHA (Ex. 36-41) also recommended a similar approach to respirator selection guidelines.OSHA believes that the foregoing suggestions are inadequate. Although the new 1992 ANSI recommendations have now been published, it is not sufficient for OSHA to reference the ANSI recommended protection factors because ANSI has provided no discussion of the basis for its recommendations. Moreover, some of the provisions of the ANSI standard appear to contradict specific information which OSHA considers reliable. In particular, the ANSI recommended protection factors disagree substantially with recommendations by NIOSH. Only if ANSI were to supply detailed discussion as to how its protection factors were derived -- including reference to and complete description of specific studies used to derive those APFs -- would OSHA be able to evaluate the merits of the latest ANSI recommendations. Moreover, allowing employers to select respirators on the basis of different guidelines, with different APF values, can only bring confusion as to how to comply with the standard.OSHA considered establishing assigned protection factor tables based on existing studies in which performance factors were measured both in laboratories and in workplaces. The quality of available data, however, was seen to vary substantially from one type of respirator to another depending on how much emphasis had been placed on a particular type of respirator by the organization doing the testing. Moreover, the results of studies which had been done for a particular purpose may not necessarily be able to be extrapolated legitimately for use in drawing other conclusions.As an example of the widely varying results and quality of available data, the following is a brief review of studies pertaining to negative pressure air-purifying respirators. Similar weaknesses in available data exist for other types of respirators as well.Negative Pressure Air-Purifying RespiratorsLenhart and Campbell of NIOSH (Ex. 27-2) did workplace performance testing in 1984 in a primary lead smelter for half mask negative pressure air-purifying respirators. The resulting report stated that 98% of the workplace protection factors (WPFs) would be at or above 10, 90% above 30, and 75% above 100. It concluded that \"an assigned protection factor of 10 is appropriate for the half mask negative pressure air-purifying respirators evaluated in this study\" (Ex. 27-2, p. 181). Each individual who participated in the study had first achieved a quantitative fit factor of at least 250 with the half mask respirator in the fit test booth. For this reason the authors emphasized that the study's results may overestimate the WPFs that would be achieved by a general worker population that had not achieved quantitative fit test results of at least 250.Skaggs and Loibl of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (Ex. 38-3) examined the performance of half mask and full facepiece respirators under simulated work conditions in a controlled environmental chamber. Three different temperatures (0 deg.c, 20 deg.c, 32 deg.c) and two humidities (15% and 85%) were examined. Half mask and full facepiece respirators were worn by test subjects performing work type exercises such as shoveling oiled gravel, walking up and down stairs, pounding nails, moving cinder blocks, and pounding with a sledge hammer. During the prefit respirator fit testing for the half mask, fit factors ranging from a low of 32 to as high as 20,000 were measured. Fit factors measured during the simulated work exercises ranged from 16 to 20,000. However, only one of the 49 test subjects who obtained fit factors during the prefit testing of 100 or greater with the half mask failed to achieve fit factors of at least 50 during the simulated work exercises. For the full facepiecerespirator the prefit fit factors ranged from 110 to 20,000 and the simulated work fit factors ranged between 21 and 20,000. For the 54 test subjects who achieved fit factors of 500 or greater with the full facepiece respirator during prefit testing, only one filed to achieve a fit factor of 100 or greater during the simulated work fit tests.In the case of full facepiece respirators tested with QNFT, studies performed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in 1972 (Ex. 24-2) resulted in a recommendation that full facepiece respirators be allowed a protection factor of 50. The recommendation was based on QNFT performed in a test booth on wearers who had been pre-screened in each case with a qualitative test using irritant smoke. Most of the respirators tested achieved fit factors into the thousands but one respirator only achieved fit factors of less than 100. On the bases of that one respirator the decision was made by LANL to restrict their recommendation to 50. However, Edward Hyatt, the author of the study, in his subsequent response to the ANPR, (Ex. 15-27), and in a later comment on a variance application in 1984 (Ex. 24-11), recommended that negative full facepiece respirators be assigned a protection factor of 100 provided a fit factor of 1000 could be obtained in the test booth. It was understood (althoughnot stated in his response) that his reason for revising his recommendation was that the one respirator which performed so poorly in the original tests had been taken off the market.In November, 1983 researchers from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory published a paper (Ex. 24-9) on reproducibility of fit using QNFT. One element of the research described in the paper was the measurement of fits of two brands of full facepiece respirators as well as fits of half mask respirators of the same two manufacturers. There are two important aspects of the measurements. First, the poorest fitting of the full facepiece respirators was more than five times better than the best fitting half masks respirators. Second; the lowest fit factor of the full facepiece models was 1,063. Nevertheless, the range of respirators was very limited.In October 1984, DuPont submitted to the OSHA asbestos standard docket an unpublished study of workplace protection factors (WPF) for disposable half mask respirators, and half mask air-purifying respirators using either dust/fume/mist filters or high efficiency filters (Ex. 38-7). The study concluded that all the respirators tested could reliably provide protection factors of 10, except that one of the disposable respirators tested could only provide a protection factor of 5. The lower protection provided by the last disposable respirator was attributed to penetration of asbestos fibers through the filter media. OSHA considers this study to be inadequate in establishing protection factors for several reasons. First, asbestos is not typical, in geometry or migration properties, of the broad range of dusts and mists that are encountered in workplaces. To assign a general protection factor based on the almost unique properties of asbestos would be highly inappropriate. In addition, thisparticular study was conducted under special conditions in which the respirators were used in a wet environment whose effect on fit is difficult to evaluate and whose effect on penetration would be different for asbestos than for most other contaminants. In addition the study did not follow NIOSH analytical guidelines for sampling and counting asbestos fibers. For example, NIOSH recommends that reliable analysis requires that at least 10 fibers be counted for 100 fields. However, in the DuPont study, 89% of the analyzable tests (71 out of 80) and filters with in-mask fiber counts for less than 10 per 100 fields.The 3M Corporation also submitted an unpublished protection factor study for disposable respirators used in the presence of asbestos fibers at the Shiloh Brake Corporation (Ex. 40). Once again, asbestos fibers, for the reasons given above, are not sufficiently representative of dusts and mist in most workplaces for use in establishing general protection factors.Another unpublished study cited in the record was performed by the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) at a cadmium pigment production facility (Ex. 38-22). The entire submission, however, consisted of four paragraphs of description accompanied by two computer graphs showing results. There is no discussion of how the tests were conducted or any description which would enable one to evaluate the validity of the study or to duplicate the testing. OSHA considers this submission to be inadequate for meaningful review.In yet another unpublished study, the 3M Corporation has submitted results of measurements of protection factors of disposable dust/mist respirators in the presence of aluminum, titanium, and silicon particulates (Ex. 41A) The study, which was conducted in October, 1986, failed to include basic information on concentrations and particle size distributions. In July, 1988 3M returned to the same site to measure particle size distribution and in August, 1989 submitted the results to the record (Ex. 41B). OSHA believes that, to be valid, all supporting measurements of a study must be made at the time the primary measurement is made. It is virtually impossible to assure that all relevant ambient conditions will be identical almost two years later to what they were at the time of the original test. Moreover, the data submitted by the 3M Corporation in August, 1989 had serious anomalies which were unaccounted for in the accompanying discussion. For example, the mass distribution in the stagesof various impactors could be accounted for only by circumstances which would be very unusual. Some impactors had few or no particles of any size. Others had only very large particles and very small particles. In the latter case, the report referred to the possibility of a bimodal distribution, but supplied no physical reasons based on actual workplace conditions to account for such a distribution.In general, unpublished studies such as those cited above are difficult to evaluate since significant details are often absent in the discussions and there has been no peer review of the assumptions, methods, and plausibility of results.By contrast, a published workplace protection factor study by NIOSH (Ex. 38-2) of the performance of disposable dust mist respirators provides results showing lower protection factors which cannot be ignored. The study determined the effectiveness of a disposable dust/ mist respirator against overexposure to nuisance particulate dust (Ex. 38-2). A total of 25 paired samples were taken, each consisting of a measurement inside the probed respirator and one at the lapel. Seven workers and two NIOSH industrial hygienists were sampled. Quantitative facepiece fit testing was performed to check for gross leakage. NIOSH calculated that \"95% of workplace protection factors would be expected to be at or above 3, 87% at or above 5, 70% above 10, and only 7% would be expected to be above 100.\" Nevertheless, despite the fact that the data seemed to predict a protection factor of 3 at the 95% confidence level, NIOSH concluded that an \"assigned protection factor of 5 for disposable half maskrespirators is not discredited by the results of this study.\" However, it involved only seven subjects and thus the range of facial sizes and structures involved were limited.The foregoing studies pertaining to negative pressure air-purifying respirators demonstrate the wide variability in applicability of such studies in the determination of assigned protection factors. Therefore, OSHA decided that these available studies as well as those in other respirator categories are inadequate for a well founded assignment of protection factors.In view of this apparent inadequacy, OSHA has determined that in order to establish assigned protection factors, there must be a program to conduct experimental evaluations of respirator performance. Therefore, OSHA and NIOSH have agreed that the assignment of protection factors should be made by NIOSH. It is OSHA's intention in this rulemaking that protection factors shall be assigned by NIOSH in its ongoing rulemaking for its certification program. (The first phase of this rulemaking was published in the **Federal Register** as a proposed rule at 59 FR 26850 on Tuesday, May 24, 1994 as 42 CFR Part 84.) When NIOSH completes its rulemaking process of assigned protection factors, OSHA will issue a technical amendment to this respiratory protection standard referring to the NIOSH final regulation. OSHA does not intend to have notice and comment on its technical amendment because NIOSH will have notice and comment in its rulemaking. In the period before NIOSH has completed promulgating 42CFR Part 84, OSHA will, in the interim, require that respirators be selected in accordance with the protection factors assigned by NIOSH in the current NIOSH Respirator Decision Logic (Ex. 38-20).The NIOSH protection factor values are not intended to replace protection factor values which, in individual substance specific OSHA standards, are more stringent. Thus, the OSHA provision which defers to the NIOSH protection factor tables is not to be interpreted, for example, as overriding the OSHA asbestos standard which does not permit the use of disposable respirators at all. Nor does this provision preclude OSHA's prerogative to assign more conservative protection factors under circumstances demonstrated in the records of future substance specific rulemakings.Finally, it is OSHA's understanding that respirators certified under 30 CFR Part 11, depending on the type, will continue to be NIOSH certified for a period of time after the effective date of 42 CFR Part 84. This \"sunset\" provision will continue to allow existing certifications while respirators that meet the new requirements of 42 CFR Part 84 are developed and certified. Following the sunset period for each type of respirator, only those certifications granted under 42 CFR Part 84 will be valid. During the sunset period, OSHA will require that protection be assigned as prescribed in 42 CFR Part 84 for respirators previously certified under 30 CFR Part 11. The new NIOSH regulation will also provide assigned protection factor values for respirators certified under the new requirements.5\\. Warning PropertiesThe question of whether OSHA should permit the use of air-purifying respirators where substances have inadequate warning properties has been of serious concern for several years. Some commenters to the ANPR felt that air-purifying respirators should only be used for chemicals that have adequate warning properties (Ex. 15-33, 15-34, 15-46, 15-48, 15-70). Others felt that respirator use should not be restricted based on poor warning properties, but that OSHA should identify a control mechanism that would allow their use (Ex. 15-18, 15-19, 15-22, 15-26, 15-50, 15-54, 15-55, 15-58, 15-62, 15-66, 15-73). Several commenters felt it should not be necessary for a chemical always to present distinct warning properties (Ex. 15-27A, 15-31, 15-38, 15-41, 15-44, 15-45, 15-47). For example, reliance on an industrial hygienist's professional judgment, along with an evaluation as described in the OSHA Industrial Hygiene Field Operations Manual (now called the Industrial Hygiene Technical Manual), wasrecommended by the American Iron and Steel Institute (Ex. 15-37). Others stated that if the contaminant concentration was monitored and the absorption capabilities of the respirator cartridge for that chemical are known, the service life of the cartridge can be safely calculated (Ex. 15-17, 15-53). The use of a monitoring device that would give sound and visual signals was recommended as an alternative to requiring that air-purifying respirators be used only for chemicals with adequate warning properties (Ex. 15-10).OSHA currently does not allow air-purifying respirators to be used when a gas or vapor has inadequate warning properties, except in the case of a few designated chemicals for which specific standards were promulgated, such as vinyl chloride, ethylene oxide and acrylonitrile. The departures from the prohibition on using air-purifying respirators for substances with poor warning properties were established in each case as part of an overall rulemaking for each chemical, which included a careful examination of industry exposure levels and respirator use factors.Allowing such use would require an examination of the toxicity of the chemical, its odor threshold, the health consequences of particular exposure levels, breakthrough time for the chemical for the type of respirator that will be used, how long the respirator will be used during the workshift, and the concentrations of the chemical that are found in the workplace. Calculating the service life of a particular respirator cartridge or canister for a chemical with poor warning properties would be possible using these facts and an appropriate safety factor. This service life calculation may be difficult where workplace exposure levels vary greatly throughout the day and from day to day. Using continuous monitoring devices with alarms, as was suggested by some of the commenters, is another possibility. Continuous monitoring is complicated, expensive, and would require a case-by-case review of each plant situation to determine the ability of the monitoring system. Therefore, this proposal hasnot considered the use of continuous monitoring devices when determining where respirators can be used.Motorola (Ex. 36-22) recommended that OSHA allow the use of air- purifying respirators for chemicals with poor warning properties if the respirator had a reliable end of service life indicator or an air-purifying cartridge and/or filter change schedule had been implemented, and the use of supplied air respirators would hamper an operation or increase risk. If the employer could not demonstrate the acceptability of the respirator according to these conditions, supplied air respirators would be required. Homestake Mining (Ex. 36-30) also recommended the same conditions along with the requirement for biological monitoring to demonstrate respirator effectiveness, where applicable. DuPont (Ex. 36-38) also recommended that air-purifying respirators be allowed for chemicals with poor warning properties when supplied air respirators cannot be used, with the conditions that a reliable end of service life indicator and appropriate cartridge change schedule be used. The AIHA (Ex. 36-44), RichardBoggs of ORC (Ex. 36-47), and Thomas Nelson of the ANSI Z 88.2 respirator committee (Ex. 36-55) described similar conditions for the use of air-purifying respirators for chemicals with poor warning properties. Mr. Nelson also wanted to limit their use to concentrations of the contaminant less than 10 times the PEL or TLV.The ANSI Z 88.2-1992 respiratory protection standard in section 7.2.2.2 (m) would allow the use of an air purifying respirator for a gas or vapor with poor warning properties only when (1) the air purifying respirator has a reliable end of service life indicator that will warn the user prior to contaminant breakthrough, or (2) a cartridge change schedule is implemented based on cartridge service data including desorption studies (unless cartridges are changed daily), expected concentration, pattern of use, and duration of exposure have been established, and the chemical does not have a ceiling limit.OSHA agrees that there are circumstances under which it may be safe or necessary to use air-purifying respirators despite the absence of adequate warning properties. In doing so, however, two factors must be considered: breakthrough of the cartridge and face seal leakage. Cartridge breakthrough can be addressed by use of end-of-service-life indicators that are approved by NIOSH or by implementation of a filter change schedule based on documented service life data, exposure levels and exposure durations. Face seal leakage is not addressed directly except by requiring fit testing. Therefore, OSHA is proposing that the use of air-purifying respirators in the absence of adequate warning properties be restricted to situations where the odor, taste, or irritation threshold is not more than three times the hazardous exposure level. Since the least effective respirator with a chemical cartridge in the proposed NIOSH 42 CFR Part 84 respirator selection tables has an Assigned Protection Factorof 10, then if the level at which the warning property exists is within three times the hazardous exposure level, OSHA believes that a sufficient margin of safety will be provided, since even a partial breakthrough is unlikely to reduce the protection factor from 10 down to three under the foregoing restrictions on use.6\\. Oxygen Deficient and Oxygen Deficient IDLH AtmospheresThis proposal requires that only atmosphere-supplying respirators be used in oxygen deficient atmospheres. In oxygen deficient IDLH atmospheres either a full facepiece pressure demand SCBA or a combination full facepiece pressure demand supplied air respirator with auxiliary self-contained air supply must be used. A critical issue is the definition of what constitutes oxygen deficient and oxygen deficient IDLH atmospheres.Table I of paragraph (d) presents in tabular form the oxygen percentages below which the terms oxygen deficient and oxygen deficient IDLH atmosphere apply -- as a function of altitude above sea level.By referring to the information in this table, an employer can readily pick out the appropriate type of respirator required at various altitudes and oxygen levels. OSHA chose to use an equivalent table of oxygen levels for simplicity, rather than incorporating a calculation formula as ANSI did in its Z88.2-1980 standard, like the table in the ANSI Z88.2-1992 standard on the combined effects of altitude and reduced percentage of oxygen.Numerous comments were submitted in response to both the preproposal draft and the ANPR on the definition of oxygen deficient and oxygen deficient IDLH atmospheres (Ex. 15-14, 15-19, 15-26, 15-27A, 15-31, 15-33, 15-35, 15-37, 15-38, 15-46, 15-52, 15-53, 15-55, 15-58, 15-62, 15-70, 36-13, 36-17, 36-18, 36-22, 36-26, 36-27, 36-29, 36-30, 36-31, 36-32, 36-34, 36-38, 36-39, 36-40, 36-41, 36-44, 36-47, 36-52, 36-53, 36-54, 36-55). All suggestions were based on the concept of a minimum value for oxygen partial pressure in the upper portion of the lungs. Most commenters agreed with the ANSI Z88.2-1980 partial pressure value of 100 mm Hg below which an oxygen deficient IDLH atmosphere exists. There was, however, disagreement as to the oxygen partial pressure at which an oxygen deficient atmosphere is considered to exist.Oxygen Deficient AtmospheresThe Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) recommended the use of an oxygen partial pressure of 125 mm Hg, which corresponds to a 16.5% oxygen level at sea level, as the point below which an oxygen deficient atmosphere exists for altitudes up to 7,000 feet (Ex. 36-52). Above 7,000 feet LANL recommended that any reduction in ambient air oxygen content (20.95%) be considered oxygen deficient. California OSHA (Ex. 36-44) recommended oxygen levels below 19.5% for altitudes from 0 to 5,000 feet, 20.5% for altitudes between 5,001 and 9,000 feet, and 20.95% for altitudes above 9000 feet be considered as oxygen deficiencies.The ANSI Z88.2-1992 standard radically lowered the recommendation for oxygen-deficiency non-IDLH atmospheres to one with an oxygen partial pressure ranging between 95 mm Hg pp O(2) (12.5% oxygen at sea level atmospheric pressure) to 122 mm Hg (16% oxygen at sea level). Under these conditions a supplied air respirator is required. Where oxygen levels are 95 mm Hg or less, an oxygen-deficiency IDLH atmosphere would exist, and would require the use of a positive pressure SCBA or a combination supplied air respirator with SCBA. However, where oxygen levels are above 16% supplied air respiratory protection would not have to be used for protection against oxygen deficiency.For confined spaces, the ANSI Z88.2-1992 standard would consider any reduction in oxygen level below 20.9% an IDLH atmosphere unless the source of the oxygen reduction is understood and controlled. However, it would permit entry into a confined space that contains between 16% and 20.9% oxygen (at sea level) without any respiratory protection if extraordinary precautions are taken to assure that the worker would not encounter any poorly ventilated areas. OSHA considers any location with an oxygen level that is reduced below 19.5% to be an oxygen deficient atmosphere requiring the use of at least a supplied air respirator as a minimum.An incident recently occurred that illustrates the problem with the ANSI oxygen deficiency definition. Two well cleaners died in the confined space of a shallow well. They had no fans to ventilate the well, and only crude homemade equipment for lowering someone into the well. After being lowered into the well, the first cleaner complained of lightheadedness. His partner was lowered into the well to attempt a rescue. The crude retrieval equipment broke under the weight of the two cleaners. Both were overcome by the low oxygen levels and died of asphyxiation and drowning. The oxygen level in the well was 17%, as measured by the firefighters who removed the bodies. By reducing the oxygen deficient IDLH level to 16% and permitting entry without respiratory protection at oxygen levels between 16% and 19.5%, the ANSI standard would permit such dangerous practices. The need for extraordinary precautions, as ANSI recommends, will not be recognized by many who choose only to see that the oxygendeficiency levels have been reduced.NIOSH approves air-purifying respirators for use only in atmospheres containing 19.5% oxygen. Moreover, Grade D breathing air is and has been considered the acceptable standard for such air and Grade D breathing air contains, by definition, a minimum of 19.5% oxygen. Since OSHA requires that NIOSH approved respirators be used, and that grade D breathing air be used for supplied air respirators, OSHA is proposing the 19.5% oxygen level as the point below which an oxygen deficient atmosphere exists. Oxygen partial pressure decreases as altitude increases. At 8,000 feet a 19.5% oxygen level still corresponds to an oxygen partial pressure above 100 mm Hg, the level where an oxygen deficient IDLH atmosphere would begin. Therefore, for altitudes up to 8,000 feet any decrease in oxygen level below 19.5% is considered an oxygen deficient atmosphere and the use of atmosphere-supplying respirators would be required. For altitudes above 8,000 feet, an oxygen level below 19.5% would constitute anoxygen deficient IDLH atmosphere. Column 2 of Table I presents the percent oxygen levels below which an oxygen deficient atmosphere exists for altitudes from sea level to 8,000 feet. Comments are requested on the values in the table.Oxygen Deficient IDLH AtmospheresMany commenters felt that the ANSI Z88.2-1980 definition of an oxygen deficiency-IDLH atmosphere was satisfactory (Ex. 15-14, 15-19, 15-26, 15-27A, 15-31, 15-33, 15-35, 15-37, 15-38, 15-46, 15-52, 15-53, 15-55, 15-58, 15-62, 15-70, 15-71). ANSI in its 1980 standard (Ex. 10) defines an oxygen deficiency-IDLH atmosphere as one which causes an oxygen partial pressure of 100 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) column or less in the freshly inspired air in the upper portion of the lungs which is saturated with water vapor. This corresponds to an oxygen content of from 14% at sea level to 20.95% at 14,000 feet. The oxygen content is adjusted using a formula to account for the effects of changing altitude. AMAX (Ex. 15-55) felt the ANSI oxygen deficiency requirements (and thus the Los Alamos position as well) were overly restrictive since they would require people working at altitudes above 10,000 feet to wear supplied air respirators, and their employees have successfully used air-purifyingrespirators at these high altitudes for many years.The Los Alamos National Laboratory (Ex. 36-52), and California OSHA (Ex. 36-44), agreed that the 100 mm Hg oxygen partial pressure level was the appropriate criterion for defining an oxygen deficient IDLH atmosphere, but only for altitudes from sea level to 10,000 feet. For altitudes from 10,000 feet to 14,000 feet they recommended that OSHA use 20.95% oxygen as the level below which an oxygen deficient IDLH atmosphere exists since people who are physiologically acclimated can live and work above 10,000 feet without adverse effects and the standard should account for this reality. The current ANSI Z88.2 Respirator Committee (Ex. 36-55) has concluded that for altitudes below 14,000 feet, work should be permitted without protection for oxygen deficiency when the oxygen content of ambient air (20.95%) is not reduced.The foregoing comments are all in agreement that, up to 8,000 feet the oxygen concentration equivalent of an oxygen partial pressure of 100 mm of Hg in the upper portion of the lungs is appropriate for a threshold IDLH level. This is equivalent at sea level to an oxygen concentration of 14%. However, NIOSH has pointed out (Ex. 25-4) that in the presence of an oxygen concentration of less than 16% at sea level one can experience impaired attention, thinking and coordination. At 14% or below, NIOSH states the possibility of faulty judgment, poor muscular coordination, rapid fatigue that could cause permanent heart damage, and intermittent respiration. In an IDLH or escape situation all of the described effects could place a worker in serious jeopardy. Therefore, OSHA believes that an oxygen concentration of 16% or below at sea level should require the extra precautions that go with IDLH atmospheres. The AMAX comment that its employees have suffered no consequences of not having usedsupplied air respirators at greater than 10,000 feet is believed by OSHA to signify that they have not worked in atmospheres with less than 19.5% oxygen.The ANSI Z 88.2-1992 standard defines an oxygen deficiency IDLH atmosphere to be one with an oxygen partial pressure of 95 mm Hg or less (12.5% oxygen at sea level). The oxygen deficiency may be caused by either a reduction in the normal 20.9% oxygen content, by reduced total atmospheric pressure to 450 mm Hg (8.6 psi), equivalent to 14,000 feet elevation, or any combination of reduced percentage of oxygen and reduced pressure. The ANSI rationale as stated in Appendix A.5 for these low levels is that the 12.5% oxygen content corresponds to an oxygen partial pressure of 48 mm Hg in the alveoli of the lungs, with the alveolar blood 83% saturated with oxygen. At higher alveolar oxygen partial pressures (60 to 100 mm Hg), as the ANSI appendix points out, only slight changes in hemoglobin oxygen saturation are seen. Much larger changes occur in the blood oxygen levels as the alveoli oxygen levels fall from 60 down to 30 mm Hg. By choosing such a low oxygen partial pressure for the start ofan oxygen deficient IDLH atmosphere, ANSI has effectively removed any safety margin from its standard. An acclimatized individual may be able to effectively operate at the equivalent of 14,000 foot altitude. However, individuals normally used to the 20.9% oxygen present in the outside air or supplied by their respirator are not acclimatized. They could be seriously and rapidly debilitated by the quick drop in oxygen partial pressure such a 12.5% oxygen deficiency IDLH level represents if their respirator should fail. The safety margins in the ANSI Z 88.2-1992 oxygen deficiency IDLH and non IDLH definitions have been reduced to their bare minimums. OSHA has chosen to reject these less protective ANSI oxygen deficiency definitions in favor of the more forgiving levels it is proposing to adopt.OSHA is proposing a value of 16% oxygen by volume as the level below which an oxygen deficient IDLH atmosphere exists for altitudes from sea level to 3,000 feet. For altitudes from 3,001 feet up to 8,000 feet, percent oxygen levels have been calculated that correspond to a value of 100 mm Hg oxygen partial pressure. At altitudes above 8,000 feet and up to 14,000 feet, OSHA is proposing that an oxygen level below 19.5% would be considered an oxygen deficient IDLH atmosphere. This agrees with the ANSI Z 88.2-1980 oxygen deficiency-IDLH level of 100 mm Hg, which corresponds to the point where the oxygen content of the alveolar blood is 90% saturated with oxygen and below which symptoms of hypoxia occur. Although OSHA is accepting the claim that work can be performed by acclimated persons at altitudes above 10,000 feet when the ambient air oxygen percentage is not reduced, comments and data are requested that will support or contradict this conclusion. To avoid possible confusion, OSHA hasnot used a formula for calculating the oxygen deficient IDLH levels as ANSI did, but instead presents in Column 3 of Table I in paragraph (d) a list of the percent oxygen levels for altitudes from sea level to 14,000 feet.**Table I. -- Oxygen Percentages Constituting Oxygen Deficient  and Oxygen Deficient IDLH Atmospheres****Column 1 altitude above sea level  (in feet)** | **Column 2 percent oxygen below which an oxygen deficient atmosphere exists** | **Column 3 percent oxygen below which an oxygen deficient  IDLH atmosphere exists**  0 to 3000 | 19.5 | 16.0  3001 to 4000 | 19.5 | 16.4  4001 to 5000 | 19.5 | 17.1  5001 to 6000 | 19.5 | 17.8  6001 to 7000 | 19.5 | 18.5  7001 to 8000 | 19.5 | 19.3  Above 8000 to 14,000 | (1) | 19.5  Footnote(1) For altitudes above 8000 feet, an oxygen deficient IDLH atmosphere exists when the oxygen level falls below 19.5%(E) Medical Evaluation. Most who responded to the ANPR, although divided in their responses to many of the questions on medical surveillance, were in general agreement that the provision in the present standard is inadequate and that there should be initial and follow up evaluations of some sort. In particular, there was a consensus that it is not safe to wait for specific complaints or problems to arise before conducting such evaluations (Ex. 15-10, 15-26, 15-27A, 15-31, 15-45, 15-46, 15-48, 15-49, 15-53, 15-54, 15-55, 15-63, 15-70, 15-75, 15-76).Experience in industry shows that most healthy workers do not have problems wearing a respirator when it is properly chosen and fitted (1, 2, 6). The most commonly found problems are claustrophobia -- which may be an intolerance of feeling enclosed or may give rise to a subjective feeling of breathing difficulty. Other common problems are chronic rhinitis, catarrh, and nasal allergies where it is necessary to remove the respirator frequently to deal with nasal discharge. Some individuals with chronic sinusitis may have breathing difficulties wearing a respirator.Most other difficulties relate to the cardiorespiratory system. The wearing of a negative pressure respirator does increase the resistance to inspiration. The problem is reduced with powered air-purifying respirators and with positive pressure atmosphere-supplying respirators. Exhalation resistance with modern negative pressure respirators does not significantly increase expiratory effort. The types of cardiorespiratory problems which may increase the individual's breathing problems when wearing a respirator are chronic obstruction, respiratory disease, emphysema, asthma in some cases, and moderate to severe pneumoconiosis.Cardiac or cardiorespiratory diseases that may affect respirator wear include coronary thrombosis, any type of congestive heart disease or decompensations cor pulmonale, other ischemic heart disease and some cases of hypertension.The amount of difficulty will clearly depend on the degree of cardiorespiratory inadequacy and also on the amount of physical effort required by the work. Some people who may have difficulty wearing a negative pressure respirator should be able to manage well with a positive pressure type respirator.The decision about the fitness of the individual to wear a respirator is clearly a judgment that can only be made by the physician taking into account the state of the individual's health as well as the physical requirements of the job.The preproposal draft would have required that employers refer employees for medical evaluations if they would be routinely wearing a respirator for more than one hour per work shift, or five hours per week. This provision would eliminate medical surveillance for employees who wear respirators only infrequently, while ensuring that those who must rely on respirators for longer periods of time would be appropriately evaluated.The preproposal draft provision exempting occasional respirator users from the medical evaluation requirements was the subject of many comments. Some commenters felt there could be problems with interpreting the exemption (Ex. 36-32), or that the exemption would be difficult to enforce with employers claiming exemptions for employees, and the employees claiming they should have the evaluation (Ex. 36-8). Dow Chemical (Ex. 36-40) stated that the exemption would be a tough administration problem. AMAX Inc. (Ex. 36-27) stated that the exemption limits were excessive and burdensome to industry. The Ethyl Corporation (Ex. 36-11) felt the exemption limits were too rigid and stated that a more appropriate time limit might be 10 to 13 hours per week or 25% to 33% of working hours. The Amoco Corporation (Ex. 36-35) supported the flexibility that the occasional users exemption showed and the American Textile Manufacturer's Institute (Ex. 36-18) felt medical evaluations should be provided for allindividuals who wear respirators for more than \"pass through\" activities. Dow Chemical (Ex. 36-40) recommended that any employee required to wear respiratory protection for any reason be provided a medical evaluation, which may or may not include a medical examination.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) (Ex. 36-34) felt the exemption did not focus on the individuals at risk such as those wearing an SCBA in confined spaces for repairs. The AIHA (Ex. 36-41) and DuPont (Ex. 36-38) also pointed to the problem of SCBA wearers who perform heavy work for short periods of time without having been medically evaluated. California OSHA (Ex. 36-44) recommended that the occasional use exemption not apply to SCBA wearers. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Ex. 36-26) felt that the occasional use exemption would eliminate physical evaluations for emergency response activities and other short use, high risk jobs.OSHA is removing the draft requirement that a medical evaluation be made available to any worker using a respirator more than one hour per work shift. This provision would have required an evaluation if the respirator were to be worn for one stretch of 61 minutes even if that were the only time it was worn. OSHA believes that such a requirement is unreasonable and that repeated use of the respirator will be covered by the five hour per week provision. Therefore, the proposal now requires that a written opinion be obtained from a physician that each employee who needs to wear a respirator for five hours or more during any work week is fit to wear one. However, in view of questions that have been raised, OSHA invites comments on the duration of respirator use that should constitute a threshold for the medical evaluation requirement. OSHA recognizes that problems may occur with interpretation or enforcement of the occasional use exemption and solicits comments on projected problems. OSHAemphasizes that the occasional use exemption is intended to apply only to short time respirator wearers, not those who wear respirators on a routine basis.Medical Evaluation ProceduresAlthough OSHA believes that a medical evaluation is important, there appears to be considerable difference of opinion as to what circumstances should trigger a physical examination, what the physical examination should consist of, who is to administer such an examination, and what the specific criteria should be for passing or failing the examination with respect to fitness for wearing a respirator. Because there is no definitive information either in the record or, as far as OSHA can tell, in the open literature as to how to resolve these issues OSHA is raising for comment three alternative versions of the medical evaluation provision. The first, which is represented by proposed regulatory text, would require that the employer obtain a doctor's written opinion on the employee's ability to wear a respirator. The nature of the medical evaluation performed would be left up to the physician to determine. The second alternative would require the performing of a medical evaluationconsisting of a medical history and medical examination, from which a physician's opinion on respirator use would be written. The third alternative would require that a health questionnaire be administered to all respirator wearers, with a medical evaluation being performed on those whose answers to any of the questions on the questionnaire show the need for such an evaluation, or who wear an SCBA for emergency or rescue operations. After reviewing the questionnaires and any medical evaluation performed, a physician's written opinion on respirator use would then be prepared.OSHA is seeking comment on each of the three alternatives and on the specific elements that make up the required procedures of each alternative. The comments that will be received to this proposal, along with OSHA's review of other medical evaluation information, will be used to develop a single medical evaluation procedure for the final standard. Therefore, commenters should detail why they prefer one of the three alternatives in this proposal above the others, and specifically address which required elements should be contained in the medical evaluation procedures. A more detailed discussion of each of the three alternatives follows.Alternative 1 -- Written Physician's OpinionThe first alternative of the medical evaluation procedures is part of the proposed standard as paragraph (e). It would require that, for every employee who wears a respirator more than five hours during any work week, a written opinion be obtained from a licensed physician as to the fitness of the employee to wear a respirator based on the type of respirator used, the workplace conditions and the employee's physical condition. Information regarding respirator type and workplace conditions would be required to be supplied to the physician by the employer. The decisions as to whether a physical examination is necessary, and if so its content, is left to the judgment of the physician. OSHA is proposing suggested elements of a physical examination in an appendix to guide the physician should he or she choose to perform such an examination. In addition, this proposal requires that an annual review, which in the physician's judgment may not entail an examination, be conducted by a physician.Possible regulatory language for the other two alternatives of the medical evaluation section are presented as follows. Although they are not included in the text of the standard, OSHA will consider all three alternatives in its deliberations leading to a final standard.Alternative 2 -- Medical History and ExaminationThe second alternative for a medical evaluation provision is a requirement for a mandatory medical history and medical examination. The preproposal draft standard contained this alternative, but OSHA has modified it in response to comments received. As in alternative 1, guidance for the elements of the evaluation would be supplied by nonmandatory Appendix C.These recommended elements are basically the same as were specified as mandatory in the prepublication draft and are similar to those recommended by ANSI in its standard on physical qualifications for personnel using respirators, ANSI Z88.6-1984 (Ex. 38-10).The preproposal draft would have required that a medical history be taken and a medical examination be conducted for each respirator user with exemptions for nonroutine users. Also included were mandatory elements to be reviewed during the performance of the medical history and medical examination. Several commenters recommended that OSHA adopt a more performance oriented approach for the medical evaluation provisions while listing in a nonmandatory appendix what the physician should consider during the examination (Ex. 36-18, 36-22, 36-38, 36-40, 36-41, 36-50, 36-55).Comment is requested on the individual elements that make up the medical history and medical examination recommended provisions listed in Appendix C. OSHA also requests comment on whether it should set specific medical trigger levels for elements of the medical examination, and if so, what these trigger levels should be.A mandatory requirement for pulmonary function testing was opposed by commenters on the grounds that it is not clear that pulmonary function testing would provide information that would not already be apparent to the physician from performing a normal physical exam. It was also pointed out that there are no specific pulmonary function test values that are considered to be clearly suitable thresholds for ability to wear a respirator (Ex. 36-3, 36-22, 36-30, 36-32, 36-34, 36-47, 36-55). The discussion in Appendix C on pulmonary function testing states that spirometry including FEV(1) and FVC, while not required should be performed. The recommendation for screening spirometry contains a set of values for FVC and FEV(1) which have been adopted from the ANSI Z88.6 recommended standard. These values, a FVC of less than 80 percent or a FEV(1) of less than 70 percent, represent levels at which restrictions on respirator use should be considered.A study of clinical pulmonary function and industrial respirator wear by Raven, Moss, Page, Garmon, and Skaggs (Ex. 38-8) recommended that a standard clinical pulmonary function test, the 15 second maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV(.25)), may be the test of choice for determining worker capability to wear a respirator. A \"conservative\" score on this test, along with other clinical data from the medical evaluation would form the basis for screening respirator wearers. OSHA requests information and comment on the use of the (MVV(.25)) as a screening test for respirator use, and whether it should be added to the nonmandatory recommendation for FEV(1) and FVC testing.Appendix C also contains recommendations for elements to be covered in the medical history. The provision in the preproposal draft stating that psychological problems or symptoms be noted in the medical history has been removed. Rebecca Eklund of Freeport McMoran Inc. (Ex. 36-28) pointed out that the psychological conditions requirement was too inclusive since there are many psychological conditions which in no way affect the wearing of a respirator. Because the medical examination covers psychological conditions relevant to wearing respirators, such as claustrophobia or severe anxiety, the recommendation that psychological problems be noted in the medical history is redundant and therefore has been dropped.Comments were also received on the preproposal draft requirement that tolerance to tachycardia (i.e. excessively rapid heartbeat) be noted. OSHA notes that the recommendation that tolerance to tachycardia due to inhaling heated air be noted is part of the ANSI Z88.6 physical qualifications for respirator wearers, and for that reason was included in the preproposal draft. Closed circuit SCBA units, also known as rebreathers, supply air to the wearer at elevated temperatures of 120 deg. F or greater. A possible physiologic response to breathing heated air is tachycardia. Commenters stated that tachycardia produced by heated air was called difficult to validate (Ex. 36-8), was not necessary to note since few respirators produce heated air (Ex. 36-29), difficult to assess and attribute to heated air (Ex. 36-32), not generally accepted by the medical profession as a problem (Ex. 36-37), challenged any problem with breathing heated air (Ex. 36-47), and questioned the necessity to impose therestriction since only rebreather respirators produce heated air (Ex. 36-52).OSHA agrees with the commenters that few closed circuit SCBAs are in use, and that checking every respirator user for tolerance to tachycardia is not necessary. Therefore, the recommendation for noting tolerance to tachycardia due to inhaling heated air has been removed. OSHA requests any information on problems that have occurred with tachycardia for wearers of closed circuit SCBAs, and comment on whether this recommendation should be included (either as a mandatory requirement or in Appendix C only) for those who will be using closed circuit SCBAs.The suggested elements of the medical examination itself, where one is performed, have also been modified and placed in Appendix C. The recommendation for the physician to assess facial conditions that may interfere with respirator fit has been dropped. As Alan Hack of the Los Alamos National Laboratory stated, most physicians will not be familiar enough with respirator facepieces to be able to make such an evaluation (Ex. 36-29). Also, any decision on respirator facepiece fit would more properly be made when selecting the best fitting respirators during fit testing.The need for assessing hearing ability was also questioned by commenters on the preproposal draft. Several commenters recommended the elimination of the hearing assessment provision since it is irrelevant to the wearing of a respirator (Ex. 36-8, 36-13, 36-27, 36-29, 36-47, 36-52). California OSHA (Ex. 36-44) stated that hearing ability should not be a consideration except perhaps where a worker wears a continuous flow airline respirator with hood or helmet that covers the head. The ability to hear is certainly important during IDLH entry, but this is a concern regardless of respirator use. The American Association of Occupational Health Nurses (Ex. 36-8) and Alan Hack (Ex. 36-29) pointed out that nonaudible alarms such as visual or vibration alarms could be used along with the buddy system for such situations. Monsanto (Ex. 36-32) questioned what level would constitute an acceptable hearing ability. ORC (Ex. 36-47) and California OSHA (Ex. 36-44) also questioned whether OSHA wasrequiring audiometric testing.Having considered the foregoing comments, OSHA believes that the second alternative should retain a recommendation for performing a hearing assessment nonmandatory Appendix C. There are situations where the wearing of a respirator, particularly one with a full helmet or hood, can significantly reduce hearing and the ability to respond to emergency alarms or warning devices. However, OSHA recognizes that the problem of hearing ability in the workplace is peripheral to the ability to wear a respirator. Therefore, OSHA seeks further comment on the necessity of assessing hearing ability when wearing respirators and on the appropriateness of this recommendation to the respirator standard. The assessment of hearing ability to assure communication and response to instructions and alarms does not require, in the standard, audiometric testing. For most respirator wearers a simple oral assessment of hearing ability would be sufficient.With respect to the question of perforated tympanic membranes, Shell Oil (Ex. 36-50) submitted a report by Dr. Thomas Milby which reviewed the issue of potential employee exposure to hydrogen sulfide via the route of damaged tympanic membranes. The report stated that there was no valid information in the scientific literature supporting that perforated eardrums would produce an increased risk of contamination for workers. Calculations were performed for the Shell report which showed, in a worst case analysis, ambient air concentrations of H(2)S would have to reach some 158 ppm before the worst case loss of an ear drum would permit exposure at the PEL of 10 ppm. Shell also included a study by Richard Ronk and Mary Kay White of NIOSH (Ex. 38-11) which concluded that workers with perforated eardrums should not be excluded from working in hydrogen sulfide atmospheres. They stated that in no reasonable case can the presence of a tympanic membrane defect significantly affect respiratoryprotection. California OSHA (Ex. 36-44) cited the NIOSH study as showing that tympanic membrane perforation was not a problem. Other commenters also recommended that this provision be dropped since it is not specifically a respirator related problem (Ex. 36-3, 36-18, 36-35, 36-47, 36-52).In light of the scientific review of tympanic membrane perforation submitted by Shell Oil, and the report by NIOSH which also reports no significant exposure from perforated eardrums, the recommendation for checking for perforated tympanic membranes has not been included in this proposal. OSHA requests any information and data regarding problems with respirator use associated with tympanic membrane defects, and any evidence for the need for checking for perforated eardrums for respirator wearers.The American Association of Occupational Health Nurses (Ex. 36-8), commenting on the preproposal draft provision requiring assessment of the endocrine system, pointed out that such problems should have been noted as a previously diagnosed disease during the medical history. They also stated that assessing the endocrine system for all respirator wearers would be costly and time consuming. If a history of diabetes or other endocrine disease was detected, than evaluations could be done on a case by case basis. Other commenters said that physicians would be reluctant to accept liability for signing off on such an assessment and that the evaluations should be restricted to the employee's pulmonary function and cardiovascular system (Ex. 36-10) and should eliminate the endocrine test as not relevant to the wearing of respirators (Ex. 36-13). Alan Hack (Ex. 36-29) and the Los Alamos National Laboratory (Ex. 36-52) stated that \"Workers so afflicted [with endocrine conditions which result insudden loss of consciousness] will be restricted from many employment tasks that do not require use of respirators. Such restrictions should not be applied specifically to respirator wearers.\" Dow Chemical (Ex. 36-40) stated that the physical manifestations of endocrine system disease would be found during the neurologic examination.OSHA believes that endocrine conditions such as diabetes should be considered by the physician when determining whether a respirator can be worn. Previously diagnosed endocrine conditions should be picked up during the taking of the medical history. However, undiagnosed endocrine system problems can still exist. The respirator use evaluation may be the only physical examination the employee has had for some time, and a diabetic condition could have developed. The extent of the assessment suggested, from looking for signs of disease during the physical exam to more extensive testing of those with signs of disease, is at the discretion of the physician. Any general work limitations or restrictions that apply to other work activities of an individual due to endocrine disorders should also be considered when determining whether a respirator can be used. OSHA does not recommend any specific tests for endocrine conditions, leaving the determination to the physician's judgment. Because thepotential for sudden loss of consciousness or response capability is something that should be considered when determining an individual's ability to wear a respirator, the proposal includes the endocrine system assessment recommendation, as derived from the ANSI Z88.6 standard, in Appendix C. OSHA requests further comment on the need for assessing the endocrine system, and on determining which endocrine system conditions would preclude the use of respirators.The preproposal draft also contained a requirement that an exercise stress test be performed for employees who use SCBA's or rebreather type respirators. The American Association of Occupational Health Nurses (Ex. 36-8) stated that exercise stress testing would be expensive and difficult to obtain for fire departments and small companies. Brown and Root (Ex. 36-10) maintained that an exercise stress test would be costly (approximately $240) and, if not standardized, would mean very little in determining whether an SCBA or rebreather respirator can be worn. Other commenters stated that OSHA should not require a routine cardiovascular stress test, but require one only if requested by the physician (Ex. 36-35, 36-40, 36-47). They also opposed the use of electrocardiograms on a routine basis, claiming that false positives require expensive follow-up testing. Also the nature of the tests required for exercise stress was not specified by OSHA, and an example of an exercise stress test wasrequested. SOCMA (Ex. 36-48) commented that exercise stress tests cost between $250 and $300, and urged OSHA to consider other testing that would yield similar data in a more cost effective manner, using a performance approach. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturer's Association (Ex. 36-37) recommended the provision be deleted and a simple pulse rate count be substituted.The exercise stress testing provision was derived from the maximum exercise stress test recommended by the ANSI Z88.6 physical qualification standard. The ANSI standard stated that individuals with apparent ischemic disease or who cannot perform well on a treadmill due to respiratory, musculoskeletal, or other physical problems should not use SCBAs or be assigned to emergency response teams. OSHA recognizes that exercise stress tests can be expensive, and that criteria for evaluating specific conditions that would disqualify workers have not yet been developed. Moreover, the requirement in the preproposal draft for stress testing would have applied only to a small group of respirator wearers, and even then it would be difficult to determine whether such a test was really appropriate. OSHA concedes that such problems would appear to render inappropriate a mandatory requirement for stress testing. Therefore, determining whether an employees' health condition precludes the wearing of anSCBA or assignment to an emergency response team has been left to the physician. However, Appendix C recommends exercise stress testing for workers who were an SCBA or rebreather respirator device under strenuous work conditions or in emergencies.OSHA is seeking further comment on the appropriateness of the exercise stress test, the most cost effective method of performing such testing and alternative methods of determining an individuals physical ability to wear SCBAs and rebreather respirators.OSHA is seeking general comment on which recommendations should be retained as part of Appendix C, and whether certain provisions such as pulmonary function testing and exercise stress testing should be kept in the nonmandatory appendix or made mandatory provisions of the standard. Additional comment is also sought on whether OSHA should add to the nonmandatory appendix a section which further describes health conditions that should be considered during the medical evaluation. The proposal lists specific areas to be investigated but does not attempt to develop a list of medical conditions and diseases that may preclude the use of respirators. OSHA requests comment on whether such information would be of use for evaluating the ability to wear respirators and which medical conditions and diseases should be on such a list.The proposal contains an exemption from the required initial medical evaluation when adequate medical records show that an employee has successfully taken a medical examination, or received a written opinion from a physician within the past year, on the basis of which the employee was determined to be fit to use the same type of respirator under similar use conditions. This exemption will help avoid the expense of duplicate medical examinations for transient workers who have already passed an initial medical evaluation for respirator use on one job and later moved on to work for another employer.The preproposal draft contained a provision requiring review of the employee's medical status when an employee experienced difficulty in breathing while using a negative pressure or demand respirator. Alan Hack (Ex. 36-29) and Los Alamos (Ex. 36-52) recommended that a review occur when an individual experiences difficulty with any respirator, not limited to negative pressure devices. Homestake Mining (Ex. 36-30) also recommended a review following breathing difficulty with any respirator. OSHA agrees that breathing difficulty while wearing any type of respirator requires a medical status review, and the language of this alternative has been changed accordingly.The final departure from the ANSI Z88.6 physical qualification recommendations is the requirement in this alternative that the employee's medical status be reviewed annually or at any time the employee experiences difficult breathing while being fitted for or using a respirator. Although the latter requirement is implied by ANSI, the annual review is not. By such an annual review, OSHA is not necessarily requiring a physical examination. The objective of this provision is to provide a mechanism which necessitates routine review of any difficulty an employee may be experiencing. Other then being performed by or under the supervision of a physician, the specific nature of this annual review is left to the physician to determine. OSHA invites comments as to the appropriateness of this provision.AMAX Inc. (Ex. 36-27) citing experience with the OSHA lead standard, stated that an annual review of medical status was not required and review should be required only when requested by the employee. Air Products and Chemicals Inc. agreed. (Ex. 36-13). OSHA requests comment on this approach.In the preproposal draft, OSHA included guidelines for medical examinations suggesting that they be given every five years for employees under forty, every two years for those from forty to fifty years of age, and every year for those above fifty. ANSI in its Z88.6-1984 standard recommended examinations every 5 years for those below age 35, every 2 years up to age 45, and annually thereafter. The NIOSH Respirator Decision Logic suggests examinations every 5 years for those under 35 years of age, every 2 years for those from 35 to 45, and every 1 to 2 years for those above 45, under most working conditions requiring respirators. Under strenuous work conditions with an SCBA, NIOSH suggested exams every 3 years for those under 35, every 18 months for those from 35 to 45, and annually for those above 45 (Ex. 38-20).OSHA requests comment on whether an annual review of medical status is needed, or whether a sliding scale of examination dates, such as recommended by NIOSH or ANSI, could be substituted for the annual medical review.Commenters questioned the preproposal draft requirement that the medical evaluation be performed by a licensed physician. Many commenters pointed out that there were portions of the medical evaluation that could be performed by other health professionals such as occupational health nurses and physicians assistants, or nurse practitioners, certified audiometric technicians, and pulmonary function testing technicians (Ex. 36-8, 36-10, 36-13, 36-18, 36-21, 36-22, 36-30, 36-32, 36-35, 36-37, 36-40, 36-41, 36-51A, 36-53, 36-55). OSHA has revised the language for this alternative to permit other health professionals to perform whatever medical evaluation procedures the physician chooses to delegate to them. OSHA requests comments on this issue and on the extent of the role that should be given to these health professionals.In requiring a medical evaluation, OSHA has proposed in this alternative that an examination be given to respirator wearers regardless of the type of respirator used or the conditions under which it will be used. Commenters have suggested that not all types of respirators place the same physical demands upon wearers, and that the medical evaluation criteria could be reduced for certain low resistance respirators. John Barr of Air Products and Chemicals (Ex. 36-13) stated that positive pressure respirators place no significant burdens on wearers, and that disposable dust masks have no discernable effect upon respiration. He suggested that OSHA exempt such respirators from the need for a qualifying medical exam.OSHA requests comments on whether the medical evaluation provisions should be less extensive for less burdensome respirators, such as positive pressure respirators or single use dust masks, and if so, what provisions could be reduced or eliminated. More generally, comment is sought on whether the medical evaluation provisions should be modified to accommodate particular respirator work conditions, and if so, what those modifications should be.OSHA requests information and data on the breathing resistance levels of respirators for wearers, and whether a medical determination could be made to select a breathing resistance level which poses no problem for respirator wearers.OSHA's suggested regulatory language for the second alternative medical evaluation procedure reads as follows:(e) Medical evaluation.(1) The employer shall provide a medical evaluation for each employee required to wear a respirator for more than five hours during any work week. The medical evaluation shall be performed by a licensed physician or by a health professional operating under the physicians supervision and shall include completion of a medical history and performance of a medical examination. In advance of the medical evaluation the employer shall provide the examining professional with information concerning:(i) The type of respiratory protection to be used;(ii) The substances the employee will be exposed to;(iii) Description of the work effort required;(iv) Duration and frequency of usage;(v) The type of work performed, including any special responsibilities that affect the safety of others such as fire fighting or rescue work;(vi) Any special environmental conditions (such as heat or confined space entry); and(vii) Additional requirements for protective clothing and equipment.(2) Upon completion of the examination, the employer shall obtain from the examining physician a written opinion which states whether the employee is fit to wear a respirator and recommends any limitations on respirator use. A copy of this written opinion shall be provided to the examined employee.(3) In the case of new employees, employers may accept an already existing medical examination or written opinion from a physician provided it was conducted within a year of the date of employment, covered the same type of respirator under similar use conditions, and meets the requirements of (e)(1).(4) The employer shall have the employee's medical status reviewed by, or under the supervision of, a licensed physician annually and at any time the employee experiences unusual difficulty breathing while being fitted for or while using a respirator. The employer shall have the responsible licensed physician provide a written opinion resulting from the review as required under (e)(2).Alternative 3 -- QuestionnaireA third alternative for medical evaluation would require that a medical questionnaire be used to survey respirator users and to identify those who require physical examinations on the basis of their medical history (Ex. 15-8, 15-22, 15-34, 15-41, 15-42, 15-44, 15-45, 15-47, 15-68, 15-62). The specific nature of this questionnaire and its accompanying procedures was not always clearly presented by the commenters, but the health evaluation provisions in the Organization Resources Counselors, Inc. (ORC) recommended respiratory protection program (Ex. 36-47) was suggested as a model medical evaluation procedure (Ex. 36-3, 36-22, 36-35, 36-38, 36-40, 36-41, 36-47, 36-50, 36-51A).The program recommended by ORC requires that a screening questionnaire be administered by a health professional or trained person for each respirator wearer, prior to fit testing. Anyone who gives a \"yes\" answer to a question on the questionnaire, or who wears an SCBA for emergency or rescue operations would receive a medical evaluation, performed by or under the direction of a physician. The procedures to be used for the medical evaluation would be left to the judgment of the health professional performing the evaluation. The employer and employee would be notified of any restrictions on respirator wear that are identified by the health evaluation. The ORC recommended program included a nonmandatory appendix containing sample questionnaires and suggestions for medical examinations of individuals who answered yes to the screening questions.Other commenters who stated that automatic medical exams for all respirator wearers were not necessary (Ex. 36-3, 36-13, 36-21, 36-22, 36-30, 36-35, 36-38, 36-40, 36-41, 36-47, 36-50, 36-51A) also supported a medical questionnaire to screen the respirator user population so that only those whose medical condition warrants a medical exam would get one. The commenters stated that the questionnaire could be administered quickly, and the unnecessary expense of medical exams for healthy respirator users would be avoided.OSHA has suggested in this alternative that the question of who should administer the medical questionnaire and determine which respirator users should be referred for a medical exam be resolved by adopting the recommended procedure in the ORC respiratory protection program. Either a health professional or a person trained in administering the questionnaire by a physician would have this responsibility. This would place this critical part of the medical evaluation under a trained individual acting under the direction of the physician who has the ultimate responsibility for approving respirator use. OSHA requests comments on the administration of the medical questionnaire and on the appropriate individuals for performing this requirement.Employees who are assigned to emergency or rescue operations with SCBA respirators would still be required under alternative 3 to have a medical examination. These individuals are placed in highly stressful environments while wearing a heavy SCBA, which places an added burden on their physical condition. A questionnaire would not serve adequately as a screening procedure for these respirator wearers, and therefore OSHA would follow the ORC recommendation for alternative 3 and require that a medical exam be performed. The extent of that examination would be left up to the physician to determine. OSHA asks for comments on the need for performing a medical exam for these SCBA wearers, and on appropriate medical procedures to be used to evaluate their ability to perform adequately during emergency or rescue operations.As examples of medical questionnaires, OSHA has included in Appendix C the ANSI Z88.6 medical questionnaire for respirator use, as well as the three sample questionnaires from the ORC Recommended Respiratory Protection Program. OSHA has placed these questionnaires in this nonmandatory appendix in order to seek comment on the appropriateness of using such questionnaires and on which provisions in these samples are appropriate for determining an individual's ability to wear a respirator. OSHA also requests any alternative questionnaires that are used in industry.The proposed regulatory language that has been developed for this third alternative of the medical evaluation procedures reads as follows:(e) Medical evaluation(1) The employer shall provide a medical evaluation before respirator use starts for each employee required to wear a respirator.(i) The medical evaluation shall consist of the completion of a screening medical questionnaire for all respirator users.(ii) A medical examination shall be administered to any employee whose answers to any of the questions on the questionnaire show the need for such an examination.(iii) A medical examination shall be administered to any employee who is assigned to emergency or rescue operations while wearing an SCBA.(iv) The questionnaire shall be administered by a health professional or a person trained in its administration by a licensed physician.(v) Any medical examination administered shall be performed by a licensed physician or health professional under the direction of the physician. If a medical examination is given, the employer shall obtain from the examining physician a written opinion which states whether the employee has any detected medical condition which would place the employee's health at increased risk or material impairment for respirator use and any recommended limitations upon the use of respirators.(vi) A copy of this written opinion shall be provided to the examined employee. In advance of the medical examination the employer shall provide the examining professional with information concerning:(A) The type of respiratory protection to be used;(B) The substances the employee will be exposed to;(C) Description of the work effort required;(D) Duration and frequency of usage;(E) The type of work performed, including any special responsibilities that affect the safety of others such as fire fighting or rescue work;(F) Any special environmental conditions (such as heat or confined space entry); and(G) Additional requirements for protective clothing and equipment.(2) In the case of new employees, employers may accept an already existing medical examination or written opinion from a physician provided it was conducted within a year of the date of employment, covered the same type of respirator under similar use conditions, and meets the requirements of (e)(1).(3) The employer shall have the employee's medical status reviewed by, or under the supervision of, a licensed physician annually and at any time the employee experiences unusual difficulty breathing while being fitted for or while using a respirator. The employer shall have the responsible licensed physician provide a written opinion resulting from the review as required under (e)(1).Medical Removal ProtectionIn some substance specific standards (e.g. cotton dust 29 CFR 1910.1043 and asbestos 29 CFR 1910.1001) OSHA has required economic protection for employees who, for medical reasons, cannot wear required respirators. California OSHA (Ex. 36-44) and the United Steel Workers of America (Ex. 36-46) recommended that OSHA request any data on the instances and types of cases where employees have been determined not to be able to wear a respirator and what happened to these workers under current respirator programs. Determining the prevalence of such rejections and the fates of those who were rejected could be useful in determining the need of employers to supply alternative respirators or the need for OSHA to require that employers provide alternative jobs for those who cannot wear a particular type of respirator. Therefore, OSHA requests the submission of any data or information regarding instances and details of cases where workers were found to be unable to wear respirators and how thisdetermination affected the worker's job responsibilities. OSHA would also like to receive any available information on the frequency with which such situations occur, or alternatively on how many such cases are known to have happened.Since the inability to wear a respirator, or failing to pass a medical evaluation, could result in employees losing their jobs, some commenters recommended that OSHA should add provisions to help employees in these situations. Medical removal protection, the requirement that employers provide employees who are unable to wear respirators with alternative assignments at the same seniority and pay, was recommended by several commenters (Ex. 36-14, 36-26, 36-44, 36-46). Giving employees who fail to pass the initial medical evaluation the right to a second opinion, similar to the provision for physician review in the lead standard (29 CFR 1910.1025(j)(3)) was suggested by other commenters (Ex. 36-44, 36-46). Adding a requirement that the employer provide an alternate type of respirator such as a PAPR or supplied air respirator in cases where an employee cannot use a negative pressure air-purifying respirator due to medical restrictions was recommended by California OSHA (Ex. 36-44).Although such provisions were included in recent OSHA standards such as cotton dust (29 CFR 1910.1043(f)(2)(iii), (f)(2)(iv), (h)(5)(i)(c)) and asbestos (29 CFR 1910.1001(g)(2)(ii)) OSHA does not feel that sufficient information has been submitted upon which such provisions could be included in this proposal for general application to all workplaces. Therefore, additional information and data are requested which address these issues.(F) Fit Testing ProceduresAlthough it has long been recognized that respirators must fit properly in order to provide protection, it has only been within the last few years that systematic approaches for assessing and assuring fit have been developed. As a result of continuing research, a number of fit testing protocols have been developed and tested (Ex. 2, 8). In addition, because of the variability of face size characteristics among individuals, different sizes of facepieces are now available, in contrast to the recent past when a \"one size fits all\" approach was generally taken.In general there are two categories of fit testing -- qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative fit testing involves the introduction of a gas, vapor, or aerosol challenge agent into an area around the respirator wearer. A determination is then made as to whether the respirator wearer can detect the presence of the challenge agent through subjective means such as odor, taste, or nasal irritation. If the presence is detected, the respirator fit is considered to be inadequate.In a quantitative respirator fit test the respirator is worn in a stable test atmosphere containing a suitable challenge agent. The adequacy of the fit is determined by measuring the actual levels of the challenge agent, both outside and inside the facepiece of the respirator.The current standard sets out no specific protocols for fit testing although it does require training which provides an opportunity to have the respirator \"fitted properly\". It also requires employees to be trained to check the fit each time the respirator is put on without specifying how the check is to be performed or even what type of check is acceptable. Experience and research over the past ten years have demonstrated that this is insufficient, as set forth in the following discussion.Even when fit testing is performed, it may be inadequate. In the past, some manufacturers included their own qualitative fit testing protocols as part of the manufacturers instructions to the user. Numerous commenters complained that NIOSH or OSHA should check the manufacturers instructions for adequacy and consistency (Ex. 15-14, 15-16, 15-36, 15-41, 15-46, 15-47, 15-48, 15-50, 15-52, 15-75A, 15-79), since employers often use or attempt to use such instructions to fit respirators to their employees faces. Since fit testing is often done by the employer, commenters also suggested that the simplicity of the protocol be stressed.Commenters to the ANPR suggested that a standardized protocol be developed which is oriented toward the hazard or level of exposure when determining the qualitative efficacy of a respirator (Ex. 15-10, 15-48, 15-64). In addition, it was suggested that the type of odor or irritant used should also be standardized (Ex. 15-54, 15-58, 15-70, 15-71, 15-76). Correlation of the testing done qualitatively and quantitatively would also aid in assuring that respirators being worn are effective (Ex. 15-17B, 34-8). The proposed standard attempts to standardize the protocol and also simplify the procedures.OSHA has recognized the need for fit testing in the development of recent substance specific rulemakings. Quantitative fit tests were required in such standards as acrylonitrile (29 CFR 1910.1045) and lead (29 CFR 1910.1025). However, specific protocols were not provided in any of these substance specific standards. Later, questions arose regarding the feasibility of the requirement for quantitative fit testing in the lead standard (29 CFR 1910.1025). As a result OSHA conducted a specific rulemaking for the fit testing provisions of the lead standard. It was consequently determined that qualitative fit testing could be used with half mask negative pressure respirators, provided that one of three specified protocols was followed, and provided that lead concentrations do not exceed ten times the permissible exposure limit (47 FR 51110).These specified qualitative fit testing (QLFT) protocols use isoamyl acetate, irritant smoke, or saccharin as the test agents. OSHA believes, based on the record of the lead supplemental rulemaking (47 FR 51110), that the three QLFT protocols accepted for use in the lead standard are generally appropriate for use with negative pressure half mask respirators and has therefore incorporated them.This proposal would require that fit testing be performed where air-purifying respirators as well as tight fitting atmosphere-supplying respirators are used. Either qualitative fit testing or quantitative fit testing may be conducted for quarter facepiece, half mask, or full facepiece respirators. The proposal details the procedures for qualitative and quantitative fit tests in Appendix A. Commenters (Ex. 36-38) on the preproposal draft stated that the protocol exercise regimens and other elements common to both qualitative and quantitative fit testing were not consistent. Therefore the common elements of the protocols in Appendix A have been standardized in this proposal in order to provide consistency.It is recognized that one purpose of revising the existing respiratory protection standard is to allow for changes in respiratory protection technology. Numerous comments were made suggesting that limiting the qualitative and quantitative tests to certain specified methods would freeze technology at the present state and would not allow for future changes nor provide any incentive to develop new test methods or test agents (Ex. 36-22, 36-32, 36-35, 36-51, 36-53). OSHA agrees and would like to develop more performance oriented criteria by which new or modified fit test procedures can be evaluated. Such criteria must guarantee a high level of certainty that the fit test will in fact select the best fitting respirator and give maximum assurance of reliable fit. Performance oriented criteria that will enable reliable new fit tests to be developed and implemented do not, to OSHA's knowledge, exist at the present time. OSHA seeks comment so that it can build a provision into the standardthat encourages and permits improvements in fit test technology. Such comment should include specifications for validation procedures and for what organizations can be designated as credible validation performers.In the absence of performance oriented criteria for determining the reliability of fit tests, OSHA is proposing to allow the use of qualitative or quantitative fit tests other than the methods specified in Appendix A provided they are validated to provide equivalent or better reliability.When a qualitative fit test is properly administered for a half mask, quarter mask, or full facepiece negative pressure air-purifying respirator in accordance with the protocols in Appendix A, OSHA proposes to allow the respirator to be used in concentrations up to a maximum of ten times the established permissible exposure limit.Quantitative fit testing (QNFT), a more recent development, measures the efficacy of a respirator by actually measuring and comparing the contaminant level inside and outside a respirator facepiece. As with qualitative fit testing, commenters stated that manufacturers' QNFT protocols differ greatly (Ex. 15-22, 15-26, 15-30, 15-44). Many objected that different test agents were used (Ex. 15-44, 15-55, 15-58, 15-79). Some manufacturers protocols only test the respirator once instead of using the average of several tests. OSHA in reviewing these comments agreed that the QNFT procedure should be standardized and for this reason includes a protocol in the proposed standard.Either qualitative or quantitative fit testing may be used for quarter facepiece, half mask, or full facepiece respirators. However, OSHA has only limited data on the applicability of the qualitative fit test protocols for either quarter facepiece or full facepiece respirators. Therefore, although this proposal does allow the use of quarter facepiece and full facepiece respirators which pass the QLFT in atmospheres up to ten times the established exposure limit, OSHA invites interested parties to submit data which demonstrate how well the QLFT protocols can detect poor fits for full facepiece and quarter facepiece respirators.If the employer chooses to use quantitative fit testing, a full facepiece respirator may be used up to a maximum of its assigned protection factor of 50 as shown in Table I of paragraph (d), provided that the fit factor obtained during quantitative fit testing is at least 500.The proposal requires fit testing of tight fitting atmosphere-supplying and powered air-purifying respirators. It is recognized that demand type atmosphere-supplying respirators have negative air pressure inside the facepiece compared to the air pressure outside the respirator upon inhalation. The efficacy of these respirators therefore relies to a large degree on the integrity of the facepiece to face fit. Therefore it is clearly appropriate to require fit testing of demand or negative pressure tight fitting atmosphere-supplying respirators. Comments were also received regarding positive pressure tight fitting atmosphere-supplying respirators (Ex. 36-26, 36-45, 36-44). Such comments suggested that it is appropriate to require the fit testing of positive pressure devices since it has been determined that positive pressure respirators do not always maintain positive pressure. Further, the possible adverse effects of the negative pressure spikes can be minimized by providing positivepressure respirator users with good fitting facepieces. Therefore, it has been suggested that quantitative fit testing should be required for positive pressure equipment (Ex. 36-26). Accordingly, OSHA is proposing that tight fitting atmosphere-supplying respirators utilizing quarter facepiece, half mask, and full facepiece masks be fit tested either by a qualitative or quantitative fit test. The proposal specifies that only the mask needs to be tested, not the entire respirator unit. Since the testing of entire atmosphere-supplying respirator units may require even more specialized QNFT equipment, and since the fit of the facepiece itself is the basic consideration, only the mask is required to be tested. It is recognized that most respirator facepieces (i.e brand, model, size) are available in air-purifying models as well as atmosphere-supplying units.The fit test is to be performed on the same brand, size, and model of an air-purifying respirator. Once a fit is achieved with a particular mask, a NIOSH approved atmosphere-supplying respirator which utilizes the same type of mask as used in the test (i.e., brand, size, model) is to be selected for use by the employee. The respirator may then be used with an assignment protection factor as noted in Table II.OSHA is proposing that fit testing be performed before an employee first starts wearing a respirator in the work environment and at least annually thereafter. Semiannual respirator fit testing is required currently in certain OSHA substance specific standards such as lead, inorganic arsenic, acrylonitrile, and asbestos. In the preproposal draft respirator standard, OSHA proposed that fit testing be performed annually. Testing respirator fit on an annual basis was considered more appropriate for a general respirator use standard rather than the semiannual fit testing required in some substance specific OSHA standards. Commenters on the preproposal draft standard agreed with the annual testing requirement (Ex. 36-8, 36-11, 36-26, 36-30, 36-31, 36-44, 36-45, 36-47). Others disagreed. Michael Stewart of the Boeing Company (Ex. 36-24) commented that fit testing should not be required at a fixed, arbitrary frequency since changes which affect a proper respirator seal occur at random. Heproposed that OSHA require fit testing whenever an employee experiences difficulty in obtaining an adequate face seal during a routinely performed positive/negative fit check. However, a study of the negative pressure fit check has shown (Ex. 24-21) that this fit check would pass respirator wearers with inadequate fits, particularly those that require protection factors above 10. Therefore, the use of positive/negative facepiece fit checks to determine when a fit test should be given would be an inadequate substitute for annual fit testing. The Monsanto Company (Ex. 36-32), Amoco Corporation (Ex. 36-35) and the Dow Chemical Company (Ex. 36-40) stated that annual fit testing was not necessary and it was their experience that fit testing every second year was adequate. It is OSHA's belief, however, that fit testing not only determines respirator fit, but also provides an opportunity to check on comfort and problems with respirator wear, and reinforces respirator training by havingwearers review the proper methods of donning and wearing the respirator. Moreover, a two year interval between fit tests has not been shown to provide adequate assurance that necessary respirator fit factors will be maintained in the workplace. OSHA encourages these companies and others to provide any supporting data or specific experiences they have that would support an alternative to annual fit testing. OSHA invites comments from all interested parties on the annual fit testing requirement and on alternative fit testing frequencies. OSHA also requests any experience from fit testing programs on how frequently the annual fit test results in the changing of the previously assigned respirator for a new model or size.The point was raised that either contractors or corporate staff members often have sole responsibility to conduct quantitative fit testing at local facilities and that a problem is created when new hires enter the work force after the annual fit test has been completed at the facility (Ex. 36-11). OSHA is proposing that where assigned protection factors higher than ten are necessary, requiring quantitative fit testing, an employer may utilize a qualitative fit test to select respirators for new employees provided that a quantitative fit test is administered within thirty days. This is allowed only when the employer is relying on an outside party to conduct quantitative fit testing. OSHA is also asking for comments on whether this provision should be broadened to cover other situations, such as when the QNFT equipment is out of service for repairs, where the thirty day exemption would prove useful.It is generally recognized that facial configuration, and ultimately respirator fit, can be affected by factors such as weight gain or loss, and can change with time. Comments were submitted requesting that specific criteria be provided on the conditions which would require a retest, such as a set amount of weight change (Ex. 36-13, 36-28). To clarify the issue the current proposal states that retesting is required as necessary, such as when visual observations are noted regarding an employee's condition which could affect respirator fit. Further it is stated that such conditions may be facial scarring, cosmetic surgery, or an obvious change in body weight. OSHA believes that it is not possible to provide specific quantifiable criteria for the extent of such changes and that it is unavoidable that the employer will need to exercise judgment in deciding when a non-scheduled fit test is necessary.Once fitted the employee shall be given the opportunity to wear the respirator for two weeks. If the respirator becomes unacceptably uncomfortable the employee must be given an opportunity to select a different respirator facepiece and be retested. Employers relying on contractors to conduct fit testing may wish to have the employee successfully fitted in two different respirators. This would prevent having the contractor return to the facility to retest an employee whose respirator became uncomfortable.Appendix A applies to both qualitative and quantitative fit testing of quarter facepiece, half mask, and full facepiece respirators. The appendix identifies three established qualitative fit test protocols and one quantitative fit test protocol utilizing one of two test agents.A protocol for the TSI Portacount fit testing method has not been included as an established quantitative fit test protocol at this time. The use of the Portacount is currently acceptable under a compliance interpretation which treats its use as a de minimis violation of the substance specific standards which require the use of an aerosol generation system for quantitative fit testing. As part of this rulemaking a protocol for the Portacount will be reviewed and, if appropriate, the existing substance specific standards fit test provisions will be revised to permit its use. OSHA invites the submission of other fit test protocols for public comment and OSHA approval before inclusion as established fit test methods.In addition Appendix A contains two sets of \"minimum criteria for a valid fit test\". One set of criteria applies to qualitative fit tests which utilize a \"non-established\" test agent or method. The second set applies to quantitative fit tests which use a \"non-established\" test agent or test method. The purpose of including these criteria is to allow and encourage the development of new qualitative and quantitative fit test methods and/or media. This is in response to numerous comments stating that any new standard should be flexible enough to allow new methods, test agents, and respirator test technology to be developed (Ex. 36-22, 36-32, 36-35, 36-51A, 36-53). OSHA requests comments as to the appropriateness and adequacy of the proposed Minimum Criteria.New test methods and/or agents may be accepted by OSHA after their use is proposed in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and comments are requested, according to a notice and comment rulemaking procedure pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. OSHA believes that this procedure, authorized by the OSH Act in the last sentence of section 6(b)(7) will allow relevant public comment to be submitted for OSHA's evaluation without the need for public hearings. Since the protocols which will be adopted in this standard will have been subjected to rulemaking, additional protocols too, should be examined in a public proceeding. However, requiring full 6(b) rulemaking, with public hearings, would in OSHA's view, unduly delay decision making on the validity of new fit testing protocols and would be unnecessary. OSHA believes that this procedure strikes an appropriate balance between the need to accommodate technological advances in fit testing, and the need to obtain input fromaffected employers and employees.Both the qualitative and quantitative validation criteria for new fit test methods require that the fit test data submitted for approval demonstrate statistically that the fit test method would be as protective. These requirements set a strict performance criteria for new test methods. While these criteria have generally been used in the past in evaluating test data it is not clear that these performance levels are the most appropriate ones to be used for evaluating new fit tests. Some of the existing qualitative fit test methods that are generally accepted do not meet these performance levels. The irritant smoke (Ex. 24-12) and saccharin (Ex. 24-20) QLFT protocols identified 92 percent of users with poor fits at the 95% confidence level. The isoamyl acetate QLFT protocol identified 93% of the poor respirator fits (Ex. 24-19). As an alternative, it has been suggested that OSHA allow the use of new fit test methods that are proven to meet or exceed the performance levels of thecurrently accepted methods. OSHA requests comments, data, and information on the appropriate performance levels that should be required for new fit test methods, and on whether the 95% of users/95% confidence level requirements contained in the validation criteria for new fit test methods should be retained or revised.The question of whether OSHA should propose standard test aerosol particle sizes to be used in validating new qualitative fit test methods has been raised. For validation testing of respirators equipped with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters a polydisperse test aerosol with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 0.6 micrometers with a geometric standard deviation of less than 2 was considered by OSHA. For testing respirators equipped with non-HEPA filters a polydisperse test aerosol with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 2.0 micrometers and a geometric standard deviation of less than 2 was suggested. These are the particle size ranges for silica dust that NIOSH uses for HEPA and dust/mist filter certification. Whether these particular aerosol sizes are the most appropriate ones to be specified for use in validating new qualitative fit test methods is uncertain. In the proposal OSHA has not established a standard test aerosol particle size. With respect to qualitativefit testing, OSHA invites comments and questions as to the size of aerosols acceptable for use in qualitative fit test protocols, whether OSHA should establish standard test aerosol sizes for validation testing, and if so, what the appropriate sizes should be.It should be remembered that, regarding the minimum criteria for validation of a new fit test procedure, the test subjects of interest, and the only ones that enter into the statistical analysis, are those who have poor respirator fits. The statistics must be based on the ability of the new test procedure to detect an already established poorly fitting respirator. It must be kept in mind that the validation of a fit test measures the performance of the fit test and not of the respirator. The objective of the validation testing is to assure that the new test procedure provides results which are at least as reliable as those of the existing protocols.The validation of new fit testing procedures has to be a carefully controlled measurement procedure using test instrumentation with an accuracy that exceeds that found in standard quantitative fit testing. The validation testing that has been done on the existing fit test procedures were performed using laboratory grade instrumentation. As a matter of caution, it is recommended that those performing validation testing for new fit test procedures submit to OSHA the test parameters of the instrumentation that will be used in advance, before extensive testing is done. OSHA invites comments to specify more precisely the performance parameters that should be established for valid comparison measurements. The section in this proposal that describes minimum criteria for validation of new QNFT protocols requires that instrumentation achieve sufficient accuracy and precision, but does not specify values for these parameters. Therefore, OSHA requests comments on appropriate values for accuracyand precision of validation instrumentation including sampling systems, detectors and processors. OSHA is aware that the ANSI Z88 respirator committee is working on minimum criteria for fit test instrumentation. If during the rulemaking process ANSI finalizes its recommendations, OSHA will give them serious consideration with respect to the minimum criteria.New Fit Testing TechnologyThe minimum criteria for fit testing also contains a section that deals with minimum criteria for new technology. It contains provisions which are general in nature, since without knowing what the new fit testing technology will be it is not possible to develop specific criteria. Fit testing methods using new technology will have to be approved by OSHA on a case by case basis, taking into account the specific nature of the new technology. OSHA requests comments on how new technology for fit testing should be evaluated, and what ground rules for minimum criteria OSHA should establish concerning its use.OSHA is aware that there are other fit testing methods under development that do not rely on particle counting, such as the controlled negative pressure fit test or fit tests that use a gas as the fit test agent. Other novel fit test methods using different technologies may be developed in the future. OSHA intends to allow for the possible acceptance of these novel fit test methods. However, there has to be a way to guarantee that any new fit test method is at least as effective as the existing particulate methods in screening out poor respirator fits. The proposed criteria in Appendix A for new fit test methods related to particle counting fit test methods, and may not be appropriate for other technologies. OSHA, therefore, would like suggestions on what criteria would be appropriate for accepting or rejecting fit test methods based on non-conventional principles.Fit Test ExercisesComplaints were also registered on the issue that the fit test protocols specified in the prepublication draft proposal were not consistent in that the exercise regimens, length of test exercises and type of exercises were not consistent among the qualitative fit test methods and that there were corresponding differences between the qualitative and quantitative fit test protocols (Ex. 36-38). For example, the isoamyl acetate method consisted of seven exercises; the saccharin protocol, five exercises; the irritant fume protocol, six exercises; and the quantitative fit test protocol, eight exercises. Therefore the initial section of Appendix A contains uniform requirements applicable to both qualitative and quantitative fit tests. Except for minor modifications, the uniform requirements are the same as those identified in the OSHA lead standard (29 CFR 1910.1025) as a result of the rulemaking on its fit testing provisions. Only those areas where substantive changes were made and wherecomment has been received are addressed below.In the course of the fit test the test subject is to seat the respirator by moving the head from side-to-side and up and down, slowly while taking a few deep slow breaths. This represents a change from the selection protocol in the lead standard, since the lead standard protocol requires the head to be moved \"rapidly\" from side to side and up and down. The Los Alamos National Laboratory commented that there is uncertainty regarding the ability of rapid head movement to seat a respirator, and also indicated that it may actually make the fit worse (Ex. 36-52). Therefore OSHA has revised the proposal regarding this aspect by removing the word \"rapidly\".The employer is to maintain a record of the fit test administered to an employee. The fit test record is to include the date and type of test, test agent, employee information, and type of respirator. When QNFT is administered a record of the test recording (i.e. strip chart, computer integration, etc.) is to be maintained. The fit test records are to be maintained until the next fit test is administered. A record is necessary to enable OSHA to determine compliance by verifying that an employee has been fit tested before first starting respirator use and at least annually thereafter; that the tested employee passed the qualitative fit test, or achieved a sufficiently high fit factor to pass the quantitative fit test for the assigned protection factor required; that the quantitative fit test was correctly performed and the fit factor calculated properly; and that the respirator model and size as determined during fit testing are the same as being used by that employee in the workplace.Initially OSHA proposed that a fit test card be furnished to the employee. The card was to contain information regarding the size and type of respirator fitted and the date of the test. Comment was made (Ex. 36-39) that the requirement for a fit test card created an additional recordkeeping burden. Therefore the requirement has been deleted in the current proposal.An alternative to the required fit test recordkeeping would be to allow the employer to sign a certification that fit testing has been performed and not require that any fit test records be maintained. This certification would state that fit testing had been performed and provide the date of the certification, the employee identifier of the person certified, and the signature or initials of the responsible individual making the certification. Since a certification is not considered a record for recordkeeping purposes, and the fit test records generated during the fit test would not have to be maintained, the recordkeeping burden of the proposed standard would be reduced. However, the replacement of the requirement for retaining the fit test records by a certification requirement would have an impact on the performance of an inspection. Inspectors would have to rely on secondary sources such as interviews of employees and fit test operators to confirm compliance with the specific fittest requirements of the standard. OSHA requests comments on the burden associated with maintaining fit test records and on the feasibility of fit test certification as an alternative to the recordkeeping currently required in the proposal.The test subject is to perform eight exercises. Seven of the exercises are to be performed for one minute while the grimace exercise is to be performed for 15 seconds. The test exercises are: normal breathing, deep breathing, turning head side to side, moving head up and down, talking out loud, grimace, bending over or jogging in place if the test unit is not large enough for the test subject to bend at the waist, and normal breathing.Comment was received stating that requiring the test subject to bend at the waist would in effect eliminate the use of the waist length hood or shower curtain type fit test hood (Ex. 36-27, 36-52). Therefore, this proposal allows jogging to be performed in lieu of bending at the waist when the size of the fit test enclosure will not allow the test subject to bend at the waist.Objections were also raised over requiring the test subject to read, particularly the rainbow passage (Ex. 36-8, 36-27, 36-28, 36-32, 36-36, 36-39, 36-49). Statements were made that some employees cannot read well. Therefore, the proposal now requires that the employee either talk out loud or read from a prepared text.One comment stated that OSHA has made numerous changes to accepted protocols without verifying the effect of the changes on test performance (Ex. 36-38). It states further that the isoamyl acetate (IAA) and saccharin procedures originally presented in the lead standard would take only 3 minutes, but that the proposal changed this to 10 minutes without verifying that the concentration in the test chamber could be maintained for the duration of the test.OSHA does not regard the foregoing as valid. The QLFT test validated and adopted in the lead standard as a result of rulemaking has 6 exercises (IAA). Five of the exercises are to be performed for one minute and the \"talking\" exercise is to be performed for \"several\" minutes. Thus the total test time would be 7 to 8 minutes. In this proposal OSHA is requiring eight exercises of which seven are to be performed for one minute and one exercise for 15 seconds, for a total time of 7 minutes and 15 seconds. Thus the total time required in this proposed standard is essentially the same length as the IAA QLFT protocol in the 29 CFR 1910.1025 lead standard. Any differences in required time are clearly minimal. Since the length of the two tests are the same, OSHA has concluded that the IAA concentration at the end of the proposed protocol would be the same as if it were performed under the QLFT IAA protocol contained in the lead standard.Qualitative Fit Test ProtocolsIsoamyl acetate protocolWith the exception of the test exercises described above, the IAA test protocol included in the proposal is the same as the IAA protocol adopted under the lead standard (29 CFR 1910.1025). Comment was received stating that the odor threshold screening test can be performed in the same room in which the fit test is conducted, provided that ventilation is adequate (Ex. 26-18), or when only a few people at a time are tested (Ex. 36-8), and that two rooms on separate ventilation systems may not be available and are unnecessary. However, in none of these comments was the specific issue of olfactory fatigue addressed.In the proposal OSHA is requiring the odor threshold screening test and fit test to be conducted in separate rooms and that the rooms not be connected to the same recirculating ventilation system. In the rulemaking in the lead standard on qualitative fit testing OSHA, in response to the recognition of one of the shortcomings of the IAA test (i.e., olfactory fatigue), deemed it appropriate that separate rooms and ventilation systems be required for the IAA fit testing and odor threshold screening test (47 FR 51114). Since nothing in the foregoing comments responded to the olfactory fatigue concern, OSHA is maintaining the requirement for separate rooms and ventilation systems.Saccharin Solution Aerosol ProtocolThe saccharin solution aerosol protocol in the proposal is essentially identical to that contained in the lead standard (29 CFR 1910.1025 Appendix D II). Comments were received suggesting that OSHA not allow the use of saccharin as a test agent since it is a suspect carcinogen (Ex. 36-28, 36-36) and that it is listed in the National Toxicology Program's Third Annual Report on Carcinogens (Ex. 36-34). However, the saccharin fit test protocol is the only QLFT protocol that has been validated for use with disposable dust/mist respirators. Eliminating the saccharin protocol would result in prohibiting the use of disposable dust/mist respirators, since they could not be fit tested. Although OSHA acknowledges that saccharin is a suspect carcinogen, it is highly unlikely that an annual exposure of 10 minutes, during most of which time a respirator is worn, could constitute any measurable risk. OSHA considers such an exposure to be de minimis. Therefore, for the present time OSHA will allowthe use of saccharin as a test agent for respirators in the absence of an acceptable alternative for testing disposable dust respirators. In this respect saccharin differs from DEHP, a test agent used in QNFT, for which acceptable substitutes exist. OSHA in this proposal is encouraging the development of new test agents and test methods as a replacement for the use of saccharin by including provisions which would allow such new protocols and test agents to be used.Irritant Fume ProtocolComment was received on the irritant fume protocol stating correctly that the irritant fume and IAA protocols had inadvertently been combined in the prepublication draft and that the cartridges required for the respirator are incorrect, i.e., high efficiency organic vapor-acid gas, (Ex. 26-18, 36-28, 36-45, 36-52). The prepublication draft of this proposal inadvertently contained the above referenced requirements which were contained in the amendment to the lead standard. The lead standard was corrected at a later date (3-3-83). The correction required only high efficiency filters and deleted all references to the use of IAA in the irritant fume protocol. These corrections are accordingly reflected in the current proposal.Objections were raised over requiring the use of a low flow air pump set to deliver 200 milliliters per minute. Statements were made that an aspirator bulb should be acceptable unless justification is provided for requiring a low flow air pump (Ex. 36-27, 36-28). OSHA is maintaining in the proposal the provision requiring the use of the low flow air pump. The purpose of the pump is twofold: to provide the challenge agent at a constant and stable rate; and to prevent a large amount of irritant from being released at one time. Use of an aspirator bulb will not provide delivery of the test agent at a stable, constant rate. Further, the use of an aspirator bulb can easily result in a large amount of irritant smoke being inadvertently released at one time.Quantitative Fit Test (QNFT)Under the QNFT provisions the employer is to assign to one party such as a staff member or contractor the duty of implementing the QNFT program. The person assigned is to be knowledgeable about the instrumentation, calibration, use and administration of the tests. Further the employer is responsible for ensuring that the QNFT equipment is kept and maintained in such a way that it will operate at its original specifications, including maintaining the aerosol size and concentration in the test environment. OSHA is requesting comment on appropriate means/methods which should be used to ensure that the QNFT unit is producing aerosol with the particle size distribution and concentration for which the unit was originally designed.The quantitative fit test is to be conducted according to procedures which are widely recognized and accepted in the industrial hygiene community. It is performed in a test environment containing a challenge agent such as a hood, portable booth, or chamber. Measurement of the challenge agent concentration is made inside the respirator and inside the ambient test chamber environment by appropriate detection methods such as forward light scattering photometry or flame photometry. During the test the respirators are to be fitted with high efficiency filters, or otherwise fitted with filters that offer 99.97% efficiency against 0.3 micron aerosols according to the NIOSH definition of high efficiency as stated in 30 CFR Part 11 or 42 CFR Part 84. Therefore virtually any measurable leakage will be the result of leaks between the respirator sealing surface and the respirator wearers face. If challenge agents other than particulates are used, the sorbent/filters must offer a similar degree ofcollection efficiency against the challenge agent.In the ANPR OSHA requested comment on what test agents are suitable for QNFT. The ANPR also raised the question of whether it should be allowable to use substances identified as suspected carcinogens and if allowable, what basis should be used to determine that the probable dose is acceptable or unacceptable. Although it is generally recognized that QNFT fit testing equipment using test agents such as di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP, commonly referred to as DOP), corn oil, and sodium chloride are commercially available at the present time, OSHA was and is interested in exploring all possible test agents for use in QNFT. On the issue of suitable test agents for QNFT, OSHA received a variety of comments. Some commenters suggested that the agency accept any agent demonstrated to be effective (Ex. 15-30), relatively nontoxic, easily detectable, and relatively stable (Ex. 15-13). Others provided lists of agents such as sodium chloride, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, di-2-ethylhexyl sebacate(DEHS), corn oil, mineral oil, and 1% ethylene in air (Ex. 15-15). Another list submitted consisted of sodium chloride, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, di-2-ethylhexyl sebacate, corn oil and mineral oil (Ex. 15-58). Others provided one or two test agents: sodium chloride and corn oil (Ex. 15-55); DOP and corn oil (Ex. 15-37); corn oil and vanilla extract (Ex. 15-10); sodium chloride (Ex. 15-44); or corn oil (Ex. 15-26, 15-47, 15-50). In response to the question of appropriate test agents it was suggested that \"The essential characteristics for an acceptable solid or liquid aerosol agent for QNFT are described in ANSI Z88.2-1980 and/or the LANL basic protocol\". The Dow Chemical Company stated that there are many suitable test agents for QNFT (Ex. 15-19). It said that within Dow, Freon 12 was used extensively and that to be suitable the agent should be readily detectable at low concentrations. Dow later stated replacement of their units would be expensive and unnecessary, should Freon 12 beexcluded as a test agent under this proposal (Ex. 36-40).The second question of whether it should be allowable to use test agents identified as carcinogens was prompted by animal studies concerning DEHP which were positive for carcinogenicity. Several commenters declared that suspect carcinogens in general should not be allowed to be used (Ex. 15-34, 15-44, 15-48, 15-50, 15-55, 15-58, 15-70). The St. Joe Lead Company (Ex. 15-44) stated: \"In general, they should not be used. The problem is not so much that one could determine the doses well below any dose of concern, but rather that the concept of a health related test utilizing a known carcinogen would tend to undermine the positive psychological value of concern of the employer for the worker's health.\" Comment was received stating that there is insufficient toxicological evidence to eliminate materials such as DEHS or PEG as test agents and that gases should not be precluded (Ex. 36-52). Any test agent should be allowed as long as the employer can assure that employees are not exposed toOther comments ranged from declaring that substances known to be human carcinogens should not be used as fit test agents (Ex. 15-22, 15-26) to stating that suspect carcinogens may be used depending on potency, concentration, exposure and other safety factors (Ex. 15-22). In the information submitted by NIOSH (Ex. 16) which was incorporated into a later document entitled \"Alternatives to Di-2-Ethylhexyl Phthalate (DOP) Respirator Quantitative Fit Testing\" (Ex. 24-10), it was stated that di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) or DOP was recently found to be carcinogenic in two rodent species by the National Toxicology Program. NIOSH reviewed the evidence for carcinogenic potential and overall toxicity of DEHP as it is used in quantitative fit testing, and concluded that DEHP should be replaced. The carcinogenic risk was estimated to be minimal for the respirator wearer under normal conditions. However, NIOSH pointed out that two critical exposure factors must be considered in QNFT; (1)Exposures to the DEHP aerosol can vary for the respirator wearer being tested if QNFT is improperly conducted; (2) Field practitioners administering QNFT, especially those using portable testing equipment, where aerosol ventilation is difficult to control can be subjected to routine and varying exposures. NIOSH tested several agents as possible substitutes for DEHP in existing QNFT equipment which was originally made for DEHP aerosol. Test results revealed that refined corn oil, di-2-ethylhexyl sebacate (DEHS), and dimethecone all exhibited polydisperse aerosol particle characteristics essentially equivalent to those generated with DEHP. Further tests showed that both refined corn oil and DEHS aerosols were highly suited for conducting QNFT. Finally, reports describing the toxicity and health effects of each agent were reviewed. The review revealed that extensive tests conducted on refined corn oil show that its toxicity is very low and that it has not demonstrated carcinogenicpotential during its use as a control agent in carcinogenic bioassays. NIOSH concluded that a refined corn oil aerosol is the best option to replace DEHP in quantitative fit testing.Monsanto (Ex. 15-26) made reference to the NIOSH work which prompted Monsanto to switch from DEHP to corn oil as the prescribed challenge agent. After considering the data, OSHA has concluded that corn oil or sodium chloride aerosol systems are most appropriate for quantitative fit testing and the proposal so specifies in the QNFT protocol. OSHA cites the positive carcinogenic findings of DEHP in two rodent species by NTP (Ex. 24-10) as sufficient evidence to preclude its use in QNFT when suitable substitutes are commercially available. Corn oil has exhibited essentially equivalent polydisperse aerosol particle characteristics to that of DEHP, and it can be used in existing systems designed for DEHP with only slightly more maintenance required (Ex. 24-10). Comment was received stating that corn oil does require more maintenance and urged OSHA and NIOSH to expedite the search for other suitable test agents (Ex. 36-39).Other test agents have been suggested such as DEHS, ethylene, vanilla extract, freon-12, and mineral oil. OSHA does not intend to exclude these test agents. However, there are insufficient data on their suitability. For example, questions have been raised on the suitability of DEHS since its metabolic fate may be similar to that of DEHP. Mineral oil was suggested as a suitable test agent but has been observed to remain in the lung for prolonged periods (Ex. 24-10).OSHA invites comments on the suitability of other test agents such as mineral oil, freon-12, ethylene, and di-2-ethylhexyl sebacate (DEHS). OSHA will consider evidence on the suitability and reliability of other test agents and the detection systems associated with other test agents. Information on the toxicity of the agent, sensitivity and limits of detection of the system, and other pertinent data will also be useful.The proposal requires that the test chamber be large enough to permit the person being tested to freely perform the QNFT exercise regimen without disturbing the challenge agent concentration, and that the chamber effectively contains the challenge agent in uniform concentration. Uniform stable challenge agent concentration is important since the ambient challenge concentration is measured from a single point, i.e. normally a sample hose suspended from the ceiling of the test chamber/hood and connected to the aerosol detection system. Therefore, the proposal requires that a stable ambient challenge agent concentration be achieved prior to the commencement of the test exercise regimen. As long as the concentration is uniform throughout the chamber, the concentration at the respirator will be substantially the same as the concentration at the location where the ambient chamber concentration is measured. Since the results of the QNFT will be determined by calculating the concentration ofthe challenge agent in the respirator in relation to the average ambient chamber concentration, a large change in the test chamber challenge concentration during the course of the test would result in unreliable results.Fit Factor EstimationThe challenge agent detection system must be coupled to a strip chart record, integrator, or computer which creates a record of the test in order to enable the calculation of the fit factor following the test. The time interval between an event such as side to side head movement and its being recorded should be minimal. This is consistent with the systems used by Los Alamos National Laboratory as well as commercially available systems. In the ANPR, OSHA requested comments on two related questions: (1) Should QNFT demonstrate the variation of contaminant concentration inside the respirator during the breathing cycle, and (2) to be an adequate test, should QNFT evaluate respirator performance for each test exercise performed by the test subject? Some responses indicated that the QNFT should be able to demonstrate the variation of contaminant concentration inside the respirator during the breathing cycle (Ex. 15-19, 15-46, 15-48, 15-50, 15-54, 15-58). It was stated by one commenter that\"a chart recorder should be considered as mandatory since this would be an extremely difficult process to follow by using only a dial indicator\", (Ex. 15-50). It was suggested that the peak penetration averaging method contained in ANSI Z88.2 1980 is the most acceptable method for determining respirator fit and in order to achieve this, the QNFT must be capable of demonstrating the peaks of penetration associated with the breathing cycle (Ex. 15-58).Others disagreed (Ex. 15-15, 15-26, 15-27, 15-31, 15-55). In particular, National Draeger Inc. (Ex. 15-15) pointed out a currently available quantitative fit test system utilizes a 1% ethylene-in-air test gas. By measuring the ethylene concentration inside the respirator with a detector tube, a fit factor for the respirator is calculated. This system for quantitative fit testing does not provide an instantaneous breath-by-breath measurement that has to be averaged, but measures the maximum ethylene penetration into the respirator, which National Draeger felt was appropriate.In response to the question raised on whether the QNFT should evaluate respirator performance for each test exercise, some commenters indicated that each a determination of efficiency is not necessary (Ex. 15-31, 15-48, 15-50, 15-62, 15-73). It was stated on one submission that there is no need to determine the respirator efficiency for each test exercise performed since in actual practice the protection achieved in the workplace is not accurately predicted by QNFT (Ex. 15-73). Other comments suggested that the respirator efficiency for each test exercise should be determined. In the data submitted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Ex. 15-54) it was suggested that \"QNFT should be able to distinguish the respirator efficiency for each test exercise. The exercise should identify which movement(s) allow for facepiece leakage and at what level the leakage occurs.\" The Industrial Safety Equipment Association suggested that \"not having the ability to distinguish respiratorefficiency for each set of exercises could result in an overstated assigned protection factor\" (Ex. 15-58). The American National Standard Practices for Respiratory Protection (ANSI Z88.2-1980) recommends that the instrument used to measure the penetration of the test agent into the respirator be connected to a fast-response recorder which records the penetration values continuously (Ex. 10). Quantitative fit test methods developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory use a detection and recording system which detects the test agent penetration into the respirator facepiece during the breathing cycle (Ex. 2, 27-12, 24-18). Notations are made on the record at the beginning and end of each test exercise and the penetration for each exercise is determined. Comment was received following the prepublication version of the proposed standard which also stated that the standard should allow the use of other instruments such as computers or integrators which would allow integration of theaerosol penetration inside the respirator (Ex. 36-34, 36-45, 36-52).Having considered the comments and suggestions OSHA is proposing that either a strip chart recorder be used to provide a graphic display of the fit test or that an integrator or computer be used which provides a determination of the aerosol penetration into the respirator for each test exercise performed. The detection system shall be capable of detecting the challenge agent during the breathing cycle, i.e., inspiration and expiration. This will permit the determination of the penetration of the test agent during the breathing cycle.Comments were requested on the methods used to calculate the aerosol penetration into the respirator. Suggestions were made to allow: the use of integrator (Ex. 36-29, 36-45, 36-52); the maximum peak penetration method (Ex. 36-28, 36-36) and the average peak penetration method (Ex. 36-28, 36-36). Upon examination of these various methods OSHA has decided to allow any of the three methods to be used provided that a determination of the test agent penetration is made for each test exercise.OSHA is proposing that the fit factor derived from QNFT be calculated by dividing the average challenge agent concentration inside the chamber, (i.e. the ambient concentration) by the average challenge agent concentration inside the respirator. The average ambient concentration is derived from the measurement of the challenge agent concentration in the test environment (outside the respirator) at the beginning and end of the test. The average challenge agent concentration inside the respirator is determined from the aerosol penetration for each test exercise by using one of the three approved methods to calculate the aerosol penetration.The test aerosol penetration measured for the grimace exercise is not to be used in calculating the average challenge agent concentration inside the respirator. The purpose of the grimace exercise is to determine whether the respirator being fit tested will reseat itself on the face after the respirator seal is broken during the grimace exercise. With a properly fitting respirator the test instrumentation will record a rise in challenge agent concentration inside the mask during the grimace exercise and a drop in challenge agent concentration when the respirator reseats itself. If the respirator fails to reseat itself following the grimace exercise, the subsequent bending over and normal breathing exercises will show excessive leakage of challenge agent into the mask and result in failing the fit test. Since even a properly fitting respirator may show increased challenge agent penetration during the grimace exercise, the penetration measured during the grimace exercise is not used incalculating the fit factor.OSHA invites comments on the proposed method based upon experience with the calculation of fit factors obtained from QNFT.As stated previously OSHA is proposing that there be a clear association between the event taking place in the test environment and its being recorded. This is critical for the proper calculation of aerosol penetration for a specific test exercise and ultimately determining the fit factor. It is the short duration leaks that can occur during and as a result of a particular fit test exercise that indicate poor respirator fit. These penetration peaks are used to determine the fit factor. An inability to resolve these penetration peaks could result in the fit factor being overstated, since by averaging all the test exercise penetration levels the high penetration levels that occurred with one test exercise would be obscured. Also the grimace exercise is designed to cause a leak in the facepiece fit to determine if the respirator will reseal. An inability to clearly associate the event in the test environment with its recording would invalidate this test exercise and make correctcalculating of the fit factor impossible.Several factors can affect the time interval between an event and its being recorded, such as sample hose diameter, sampling rate, and length of sampling hose. Response time will increase with an increase in length of sampling line and/or increase in diameter of sampling line. Therefore the length of the sampling lines and their inside diameter should be as small as possible. Inside diameters of 1/8 inch or less have been commonly used (Ex. 2). Sampling rates generally vary from 1 to 2 liters per minute (Ex. 24-7, 6), depending on the detection system used. The tubing used for sampling the test chamber challenge agent concentration and the tubing used for testing the challenge agent concentration inside the respirator must be of the same length and inside diameter. This will result in an equivalent aerosol loss in the sampling lines due to aerosol deposition in each sample line.In order to minimize potential contamination of the atmosphere in the room where tests are being conducted, and to minimize exposure of the QNFT test operator to the challenge agent, as well as to prevent interference with the detection system from room air contaminated with the challenge agent, the proposed protocol requires that any air exhausted from the test booth/chamber must pass through a high-efficiency filter (or sorbent).Since the relative humidity in the test chamber may affect the particle size of sodium chloride aerosols the protocol further requires that the relative humidity be kept below 50 percent (Ex. 25-3 p. 40). This is consistent with manufacturer's instructions for sodium chloride units.It is imperative that the respirator used in QNFT be in proper working order. A respirator which may fit an individual better than others could be rejected if there is leakage due to problems resulting from improper maintenance such as sticking exhalation valves, leakage around the probe port, leakage around hose connections, or missing gaskets. Therefore the proposal requires that all respirators used in QNFT be inspected for defects and cleanliness. Such inspection must include checking the condition of the facepiece body for cracking and holes or tears in the rubber, checking the inhalation and exhalation valve assemblies for cracks and/or tears in valve material, checking for foreign material between the valve and valve seats, proper installation of the valve body in the facepiece, and warped or wrinkled valves. Respirators with such conditions cannot be used for fit testing. This is consistent with practices as published by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (Ex. 25-3 p. 37, 25-4An additional requirement is that either a positive or negative pressure fit check be conducted to ensure that the respirator facepiece is properly adjusted prior to starting QNFT testing. The test protocol in the preproposal draft also required that a screening QLFT be conducted after the respirator was worn for a brief time. Comments were received stating that a mandatory screening QLFT is unnecessary (Ex. 36-52). The purpose of the screening QLFT was to minimize the QNFT test time by quickly identifying poorly fitting respirators (with gross leakage) prior to the commencement of the QNFT. The screening QLFT suggested was an abbreviated IAA or irritant fume QLFT. The test agent was briefly introduced into the air near the facepiece seal area. If the agent was detected then a different respirator was tried. This screening QLFT requirement would reduce QNFT test time for employers, since poorly fitting respirators that would normally fail a QNFT would fail the screening QLFT first.However, a mandatory screening QLFT complicates the testing procedure, and poorly fitting respirators would be detected during the fit checks before starting the QNFT, or by exceeding the maximum peak leakage rate allowed during QNFT. Screening QLFT is recommended to reduce expensive testing time, but does not need to be mandatory, and therefore this requirement has been dropped.Prior to the commencement of the QNFT a stable challenge test agent concentration must be achieved. The concentration of some test environments such as small booths or waist type hoods may be diluted significantly when the test subject enters the booth. Normally the ambient challenge agent concentration will stabilize within 2 to 5 minutes. ANSI Z88.2-1980 addressed this issue by requiring that the design of the chamber and equipment used to generate the test atmosphere should ensure that the concentration inside the chamber does not vary more than 5% during a test (Ex. 10). OSHA is proposing that the test system be checked to verify that a stable chamber concentration (+/- 10%) has been achieved prior to the QNFT and at the end of the test. It has been OSHA's experience that a +/- 10% variation in test agent concentration stability has little appreciable effect. OSHA requests comments on any problems with test agent concentration stability and on the appropriate percent variation thatshould be allowed.OSHA is further proposing that in order to successfully complete a QNFT the test subject must complete three separate tests with the same respirator. Respirator research has demonstrated that variation occur in the fit factors achieved with repeated fit tests on the same individual with the same respirator. No wearer can expect to duplicate the exact same fit with a particular respirator as the respirator is removed and donned repeatedly. If only one fit test is performed, there is no guarantee that the level of fit measured during that one test will be achieved with repeated wearings. Therefore, OSHA is requiring that three tests be performed, with the lowest fit factor obtained being used to determine whether the minimum required fit factor is exceeded. Using the lowest of the three values, OSHA feels, is the most protective approach to make sure that the respirator will not be used in an atmosphere which might require a higher fit factor than that respirator can consistently give.OSHA requests comments on the three quantitative fit test requirement and any data on alternative ways of measuring continued protection levels for individual respirator wearers.OSHA had initially proposed that the results of the three tests must be within 10% of each other. However, response to that aspect indicated that obtaining three results within 10% were not feasible and the suggestion was made that OSHA should reevaluate that requirement (Ex. 36-22, 36-29, 36-38, 36-39, 36-41, 36-45). Comment was also received stating that three tests were unnecessary (Ex. 36-34).OSHA in the current proposal has deleted the requirement for test results to be within a 10% range since consistently obtaining tests with a 10% range may not be feasible. However, the requirement for performing three fit tests is being maintained.The results of all three tests must be above the minimum fit factor needed for that class of tight fitting air-purifying respirator. The required fit factors are established by applying a safety factor of 10 to the NIOSH APFs. For example, quarter and half mask air-purifying respirators with a NIOSH APF of 10 would need to achieve at least a fit factor of 100; and full facepiece air-purifying respirators with a NIOSH APF of 50 would require a minimum fit factor of 500. Finally the lowest of the three values must be used as representing the fit test results.OSHA has proposed a safety factor of 10 because of variability in the fit testing procedures themselves, and to account for other variables such as changes in facepiece fit when the respirator is worn in the workplace as opposed to during fit testing. A safety factor of 10 accounts for these variations, and is current practice.Adjustments in the respirator are not to be made during the QNFT. Any facepiece fit adjustments must be made before starting the exercise regimen. This is consistent with existing practices (Ex. 25-3 p. 38) and is intended to prevent manipulation of the respirator in order to achieve high fit factors.The fit test is to be terminated whenever any single peak penetration exceeds two percent for half masks and quarter facepiece respirators and one percent for full facepiece respirators. Such leaks correspond to fit factors of 50 for half masks and 100 for full facepiece respirators and indicate an unacceptably poor respirator fit. Once the test is terminated the respirator may be refitted or adjusted and the subject retested. If any of the subsequent three required QNFT tests that are performed after the respirator has been refitted or adjusted are terminated because of excessive penetration, then the respirator is considered to have an unacceptable fit and a different respirator must be selected and tested.(G) Use of RespiratorsOnce the respirator has been properly selected and fitted, its protection efficiency must be maintained by proper use. The employer is required to ensure that respirators are used properly in the workplace, and to include specific procedures for doing so in the written plan for compliance. This requirement is written in performance language, with the specific content of the written procedures left for the employer to establish.One area of particular concern involves atmospheres where oxygen deficiency or the concentrations of a hazardous chemical are unknown and/or potentially immediately dangerous to the life of health (IDLH) of employees. Care must be exercised in these situations since failure of the respirator to provide the appropriate protection may result in serious injury or death. Therefore, the employer is required to establish specific written procedures for the use of respirators in IDLH atmospheres including four specific use limitations.The first provision requires that employees wear only positive pressure SCBAs or combination supplied air respirators with auxiliary air supply in IDLH atmospheres. Negative-pressure air-purifying respirators are subject to face seal leakage, and depend on a filtering or adsorption mechanism for protection. The positive pressure supplied air respirators allowed in IDLH atmospheres supply air from an uncontaminated source, have less of a problem with face seal leakage and have no filter penetration problems. Two types of such positive pressure respirators are listed in the respirator selection tables in paragraphs (d) of the proposed standard for use in IDLH atmospheres; the positive pressure SCBA and a positive pressure supplied respirator with auxiliary self-contained air supply. They are the only respirators to be used in IDLH work conditions to ensure that the employee has the greatest degree of protection possible.The second IDLH provision requires a \"buddy\" system where employees are required to work in IDLH atmospheres. There must be at least one additional person present, in communications with the worker(s) in the IDLH area but located where he or she will be outside the IDLH atmosphere and thus would be able to provide or call for emergency assistance if necessary. The third provision specifies that retrieval equipment must be supplied or equivalent provisions for rescue be made for those entering the IDLH atmosphere. The fourth provision states that a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus must be provided for the person(s) responsible for emergency assistance. These provisions are essentially the same as those that are in OSHA's current standards.A more general issue involves tight fitting facepiece respirators which rely on a good facepiece to face seal in order to achieve effective protection. Therefore, the employer could not allow employees to wear such respirators with conditions which prevent such a seal. Facial hair such as a growth of beard or sideburns, absence of dentures, or a skull cap that projects under the facepiece seal are examples of such conditions. Many ANPR commenters stated that OSHA should prohibit facial hair that interferes with the facepiece seal (Ex. 15-11, 15-18, 15-26, 15-27A, 15-30, 15-33, 15-35, 15-36, 15-41, 15-52, 15-58, 15-62, 15-73, 15-77). Others stated that beards should be allowed with respirators that do not rely on adequate face seals for protection such as supplied air hoods, helmets, or suits. (Ex. 15-14, 15-31, 15-34, 15-46, 15-47, 15-48, 15-54, 15-55, 15-79, 15-81). Research performed with half mask and full facepiece respirators on the effects of facial hair on facepiece seal showthat fit cannot be assured if hair is present. (Ex. 3, 13, 15-50, 23-2, 23-3).Two ANPR commenters recommended that OSHA allow beards when the results of a fit test indicate that a satisfactory seal has been obtained (Ex. 15-38, 15-42). A report of a study by Fergin (23-1) on carbon setters with beards which tested the protection factors of several types of disposable respirators stated that acceptable performance was achieved and that there was no significant difference in respirator performance for employees with or without beards under pot room conditions. Fergin stated that \". . . where acceptable protection factors can be demonstrated for subjects with facial hair, the no-beard rule should be waived from a regulatory viewpoint for such proven cases.\" However, the ability to obtain a fit factor for a bearded respirator wearer does not mean that the worker can reliably be expected to achieve that same protection level each time the respirator is used. Beards grow and change daily, even hourly. Each time a respirator is donned there is fit variability. Suchvariability in face seal is greatly increased for bearded workers. This large variability in fit means that a reliable seal cannot reasonably be expected. OSHA believes that the evidence supports the contention that a reliable seal cannot be achieved where facial hair interferes with the seal of tight fitting respirators.In commenting on the preproposal draft the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers (Ex. 36-2) opposed the facial hair policy proposed by OSHA and recommended that OSHA prohibit blanket no beard policies of employers. The International Chemical Workers Union (Ex. 36-14) recommended that the standard specify respiratory types that could be used with facial hair. Amoco Corporation (Ex. 36-35) requested that more definitive language be added to allow employers clearer guidelines to enforce facial hair policies. Allied Corporation (Ex. 36-49) also wanted a stronger statement prohibiting facial hair. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Ex. 36-31) and the Industrial Safety Equipment Association (Ex. 36-45) agreed with OSHA's proposed prohibition on beards when wearing tight fitting facepiece respirators. The Organization Resources Counselors (Ex. 36-47) and 3M (Ex. 36-54) stated that the prohibition on facial hair that interferes with the facepiece seal should also include positivepressure respirators that depend upon a tight facepiece to face seal.The draft provision prohibiting conditions such as beards that interfere with the seal of tight fitting respirators has been modified after consideration of these comments. Additional wording has been added to clarify that the provision covers not only negative pressure respirators that require a tight seal but pressure demand and positive pressure respirators as well. The provision covers only tight fitting respirators and is not meant to be a blanket prohibition on beards with respirators. There are other types of respiratory equipment such as hoods, helmets and suits which can be worn by employees with beards since they do not rely upon a tight facepiece fit. Also the wording in the examples has been changed to read \"facial hair that interferes with the facepiece seal\" rather than a growth of beard or sideburns since it is interference with the facepiece seal that OSHA prohibits, not the presence of facial hair. OSHA invites comments on this issue and the wording of the proposedprovision of the standard, and whether OSHA should require that employers provide respirators which do not rely upon a tight facepiece fit in such circumstances.Corrective glasses or goggles must also be worn in such a way that they do not interfere with the seal of the facepiece to the face. Although the employer is free to choose any option to comply with this, OSHA suggests that full facepiece respirators be worn where either corrective glasses or eye protection are required since corrective lenses can be mounted into the full facepiece respirators. In addition, the full facepiece may be more comfortable, and less cumbersome, than wearing a half mask and chemical goggles which seal to the face as well.OSHA's current respirator standard does not allow contact lenses to be worn with respiratory protection. In reviewing this requirement, the main justification has been that with full facepiece respirators, if a contaminant got into the employee's eye, the involuntary response would be to remove the mask to attend to the eye, thus removing the respiratory protection. A second possible problem with contact lenses is that the dry air inside a positive pressure SCBA facepiece could dry out the contact lenses. It has also been suggested that contaminants that get into the facepiece can become lodged under the contact lens, be held against the eye, and enter into the bloodstream. While these possible problem areas have been proposed for contact lenses, OSHA has not found evidence of such problems occurring in the workplace. With the improvements that have occurred with contact lens technology, particularly in soft contact lenses, people who are able to wear contact lenses comfortably ineveryday life should be able to wear contact lenses with a respirator.OSHA funded a survey on the use of contact lenses by fire fighters which was conducted by the Lawrence National Livermore Laboratory (Ex. 38-9). Of the 403 fire fighters who regularly wore contact lenses with SCBA, only 6 responded that contact lens created a problem such as a contact lens being out of place or a particle under the lens causing the respirator facepiece to be removed in an environment where the facepiece would normally be worn. The wearing of conventional eyeglasses inside the respirator facepiece, as is required by the current OSHA standard, had a proportionately higher number of problems. The study concluded that the prohibition on wearing contact lenses with a full facepiece respirator should be withdrawn.The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union (Ex. 36-23) supported removing the prohibition on the use of contact lenses with respirators. Alan Hack of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (Ex. 36-29) cited the Lawrence Livermore contact lens study and the lack of adverse experience with contacts as reasons for permitting their use. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Ex. 36-31) agreed that the contact lens prohibition needed to be examined and hoped the Lawrence Livermore survey on contact lenses would not contradict their use with respirators. MSHA (Ex. 36-34) stated that contact lenses should not be used with respirators until further data has been developed to indicate their safety with the movement of chemicals through the lens, since many of the new contact lenses allow passage of air and water through the lens. Earle Shoub (Ex. 36-17) stated that if OSHA is determined to permit the use of contact lenses under a full facepiece respirator, this permission should not extend to IDLHOSHA believes the Lawrence Livermore contact lens study of fire fighters supports removing the prohibition on the use of contact lenses with respirators. No evidence shows that wearing contact lenses with respirators increases safety hazards. Therefore, OSHA is proposing to remove the prohibition in the current standard on the use of contact lenses with respirators. OSHA requests any comments or information as to the appropriateness of using contact lenses with respirators, and any problems that have occurred with the use of contact lenses in the workplace.In dealing with skin irritation and contamination, the proposal would require the employer to permit employees to leave the respirator use area as a necessary to wash their faces and respirator facepieces. The preproposal draft provision permitted employees to leave the work area is necessary to wash their faces and respirators. Several commenters asked that the phrase \"work area\" be changed to \"respirator area\" (Ex. 36-22, 36-30, 36-40, 36-41), since employees can wash their faces and respirators at appropriate cleaning sites located outside the respirator use area without necessarily having to leave the work area. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (Ex. 36-37) recommended changing the wording of the provision from \"as necessary\" to \"if necessary\" since excessive washing of the skin may aggravate an irritated skin by removing protective oils. Richard Boggs of ORC (Ex. 36-47) recommended that this requirement be dropped since it was a labor relations issue and not allconditions of respirator use result in situations where such a requirement would make sense. OSHA agrees with the commenters that employees do not necessarily need to leave the work area to clean their faces and respirators, and the wording of the provision has been changed from work area to respirator use area. OSHA believes that potential health problems of skin irritation and contamination associated with wearing a respirator cannot properly be relegated to a labor relations issue as ORC suggests and OSHA has retained this provision in the proposal.Another new provision involves the filter elements of air-purifying respirators. Employers are to allow employees to change such elements whenever employees detect a change in breathing resistance or chemical breakthrough. Since breathing rates differ, and workplace contamination levels may vary, it is difficult to predict the service life of a particular filtering element. Subjectively detected breathing resistance indicates that the load on the particulate filter may be approaching capacity and that the filter must be changed to ensure continuing protection. This decision was supported by several commenters in response to ANPR question 29 on service life (Ex. 15-18, 15-19, 15-38, 15-47, 15-48, 15-52, 15-54, 15-75B).Comments on the preproposal draft also recommended that odor or chemical vapor breakthrough was a reason for changing an organic vapor cartridge or canister (Ex. 36-29, 36-30, 36-32, 36-41, 36-52, 36-55). The wording of the proposal has been changed to add chemical vapor breakthrough as a cause for changing filters. Wording has also been added to permit employees to leave the respirator use area to change filters since this should be done only in clean air.The proposal also includes a provision that requires respirators be repaired or discarded and replaced immediately when they are no longer in their original working condition. Examples of these changes in condition would be that the strap has broken, the respirator has lost its shape, or the face seal can no longer be maintained. Since respirators must be in good working condition to function, it is imperative that they not be used if they have been impaired in any way. The respirator manufacturers can supply replacement parts for damaged portions of their elastomeric respirators. Disposable respirators cannot be repaired and must be discarded when damaged.Many commenters to the ANPR stated that disposable respirators should be allowed to be used until they no longer can provide the protection for which they were designed (Ex. 15-13, 15-14, 15-19, 15-22, 15-30, 15-34, 15-36, 15-37, 15-41, 15-44, 15-46, 15-48, 15-53, 15-58, 15-75A, 15-75B, 15-81). How the useful service life would be determined, whether by professional judgment or by having the manufacturers of the respirators make a determination, was unclear. Such a specific service life determination is difficult to make. Support for a one day or one shift limit for the use of disposable respirators was presented by several ANPR commenters (Ex. 15-8, 15-18, 15-26, 15-33, 15-50, 15-54, 15-55, 15-70, 15-75). Disposable respirators are designed to be used and discarded. Their durability with repeated use is not great, and most of them are not designed to be easily cleaned or sanitized.The proposal requires that disposable respirators which cannot be cleaned and sanitized be discarded at the end of the task or work shift whichever comes first. There are some disposable respirators which can be cleaned and sanitized after use, but they cannot be resupplied with an unused filter, and therefore the proposal would require disposal after their useful service life limit has been reached.The employer is also to ensure that employees, upon donning the respirator, perform a facepiece seal check prior to entering the work area when wearing a respirator. The negative-pressure sealing check and the positive-pressure sealing check included in Appendix B, or the respirator manufacturer's recommended procedures shall be used for all respirators on which such checks are possible. The use of such seal checks are a way of helping to ensure that attention is paid to obtaining an adequate facepiece seal each time a respirator is used.An additional requirement being proposed by OSHA is that each self- contained breathing apparatus used in IDLH atmospheres, or for emergency entry or fire fighting, be certified for a minimum service life of thirty minutes. Certified SCBA devices are available with shorter service lives, but given the types of situations encountered in IDLH or emergency situations, OSHA maintains that a minimum of thirty minutes would be required to ensure protection in these conditions. The thirty minute service life requirement does not apply to combination supplied air respirators with auxiliary air supply since the air for normal work operations is supplied by an air line. No service life requirement has been set for the auxiliary air supply bottle, but the auxiliary air supply must be sufficient to permit escape from the IDLH atmosphere should the air line fail. Emergency escape SCBAs also do not have to meet the thirty minute service life requirement, since their intended use is only for escape.The preproposal draft contained provisions to allow the use of \"buddy breathing\" devices and the interchange of air cylinders between SCBAs, as is permitted under the OSHA fire brigades standard (29 CFR 1910.156(F)). Comments on the preproposal draft by NIOSH (Ex. 36-42) recommended that OSHA not allow the interchange of respirator air cylinders since differences in air cylinder backpack construction could result in the cylinder falling off while in an IDLH atmosphere. Cylinders come in several different sizes, with varying air capacities and operating pressures, and can be constructed of different materials. As NIOSH points out, this can present problems with respirator operation when some types of cylinders are interchanged. NIOSH also considered initiating an approval program for SCBAs with emergency escape breathing support systems (buddy breathers) but found from their survey of interested parties that a safe and practical emergency escape breathing support system could not becertified at this time. Current buddy breathing systems have problems with equipment reliability and with maintaining adequate airflow in the positive pressure mode. The Industrial Safety Equipment Association (Ex. 36-45) also disagreed with the air cylinder interchange and buddy breather provisions and stated that extending their use to general industry applications would present problems since rescue and specialized training are not as prevalent in general industry as in fire fighting, and recommended that the practice not be allowed. Dow Chemical (Ex. 36-40) recommended that the air cylinder interchange and buddy breather provisions be deleted or put in a nonmandatory appendix. ORC (Ex. 36-47) also recommended a nonmandatory appendix. MSHA (Ex. 36-34) stated that the use of buddy breathers or the interchanging of air cylinders voids the NIOSH/MSHA approvals and asked whether OSHA was going to certify these changes as safe for the wearer. Earle Shoub (Ex. 36-17) also pointed out thatthe use of these modified respirators voids their NIOSH/MSHA approval, and suggested OSHA include a specific exemption from the NIOSH/MSHA approval requirement when they are used.Since there are problems in assuring the proper operation of respirators modified to include buddy breathing devices, and there are problems with interchanging air cylinders of different construction, pressure, and size between different SCBAs, OSHA has decided to delete the provisions dealing with buddy breathing devices and air cylinder interchange from the proposal. The problems with their use given by the preproposal draft commenters and the lack of a demonstrated need for their use in general industry work situations has lead OSHA to remove these provisions from the proposal. Their use is still allowed for fire brigades under the fire brigades standard. OSHA seeks comment on this decision and on the performance of such devices in industry.Commenters were equally divided on the issue of requiring low flow alarms or indicators for PAPRs. The AIHA (Ex. 15-81) thought the issue was related more to equipment certification rather than use, and suggested that NIOSH consider the advisability of low flow indicators as permissible modifications. Some felt OSHA should encourage the development of low flow indicators since it is the positive pressure generated by the normal PAPR airflow rates that give PAPRs their high protection factors (Ex. 15-14, 15-22, 15-34, 15-46, 15-48, 15-50, 15-51, 15-54, 15-55, 15-62, 15-76, 15-77, 15-79). Since low airflow could be detected by the wearer, some commenters felt airflow indicators were unnecessary (Ex. 15-16, 15-19, 15-27A, 15-44, 15-53, 15-58, 15-66, 15-70, 15-73, 15-81).OSHA has decided not to require the use of low flow alarms or indicators for PAPRs. The protection levels that PAPRs achieve are in part dependent upon maintaining an adequate airflow through the respirator. OSHA encourages the use of airflow indicators with PAPRs, but since they are not currently available on existing PAPRs it has been decided not to require them at this time.When PAPRs should be used was also the subject of comments. Some commenters felt that OSHA should not dictate the circumstances where PAPRs should be used (Ex. 15-30, 15-53, 15-58, 15-73). Most commenters felt PAPRs should be used where the employer or safety and health professionals determine their use is appropriate (Ex. 15-13, 15-14, 15-19, 15-22, 15-51, 15-62, 15-70, 15-76). Others felt PAPRs should be used when a high level of protection must be assured (Ex. 15-27A, 15-46, 15-79). PAPR use was also recommended where a significant physiological burden would be imposed by a negative pressure respirator (Ex. 15-38, 15-44, 15-46).OSHA has also decided not to dictate the circumstances where PAPRs may be used. The employer or safety and health professional in charge of the respirator program is in the best position to determine where and when PAPR use is most appropriate. The PAPR's ability to provide increased protection, easier breathing, and greater worker acceptance should be taken into account during respirator selection. However, the responsibility for respirator selection has been placed on the respirator program administrator, and OSHA relies on the administrator to assure that the appropriate respirator is chosen. However, OSHA asks for comments on whether employees should be able to choose PAPRs rather than negative pressure respirators because of their reduced breathing resistance. OSHA has permitted this in several standards such as the coke oven emissions (29 CFR 1910.1029) and cotton dust (29 CFR 1910.1043). However, OSHA's experience is that few employees make the request.(H) Maintenance and Care of RespiratorsIn order to ensure continuing protection from respiratory protective devices, it is necessary to establish and implement proper maintenance and care procedures. A lax attitude toward this part of the respiratory protection program will negate successful selection and fit because the devices will not deliver the assumed protection unless they are kept in good working order.OSHA believes that the provisions on maintenance and care that exist in the current standard are effective and adequate. Therefore this proposal has mainly readopted the current OSHA provisions, the primary exception being the provisions which deal with cleaning and disinfecting respirators after they are worn. The present standard, while requiring cleaning and disinfecting, does not specify when to do it or provide guidelines for how it should be done. Consequently many employers have not been following these provisions, with the consequent result that the cleaning and disinfecting provision is one of the most frequently cited for violation by OSHA compliance officers. Respirators which are not cleaned and disinfected -- particularly those used by more than one employee -- can cause skin irritation and dermatitis. Where the toxin to be protected against is a dust, mist or fume, build up of it on the respirator seal or within the respirator will reduce the protection factor given bythe respirator because the toxin is in the breathing zone. In addition, the build-up of contamination on the respirator can contribute to the deterioration of the materials, and thus deterioration of the protection. Full facepieces must be cleaned to ensure that employees can see through the facepieces.The proposal requires that routinely used respirators which are reserved for the exclusive use of a particular employee be cleaned and disinfected at least after each day's use. If a respirator is routinely used by more than one employee, it must be cleaned and disinfected after each use. Respirators maintained for emergency use must also be cleaned and disinfected after each use. Recommended procedures for cleaning and disinfection are included in Appendix B of the proposed standard.In comments on the preproposal draft, Thomas Nelson of the ANSI Z88.2 respirator committee suggested that the cleaning instructions of the respirator manufacturer be allowed, since they may be different than these in Appendix B, or cover contaminants which cannot be cleaned using the methods in Appendix B such as radioactive materials. The Dow Chemical Company (Ex. 36-40) recommended that the reference to Appendix B be deleted and a statement to follow the manufacturer's recommended procedures be added. OSHA agrees and has added wording permitting the use of manufacturer's cleaning instructions.Comments on the proposed draft also addressed the issue of the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting of respirators. The American Textile Manufacturers Institute (Ex. 36-18) felt that respirators should be cleaned after each day's use and disinfected periodically as needed. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturer's Association (Ex. 36-37) stated that cleaning and disinfecting of respirators should be required periodically. DuPont (Ex. 36-38) felt that the provisions of the respirator program suggested by Organization Resources Counselors (ORC) (Ex. 36-47 Attachment 1) that requires cleaning frequently enough to avoid hazardous exposures to residues was sufficient. Richard Boggs of ORC (Ex. 36-47) urged adopting the language in the ORC program since it would allow the individual organization to tailor its cleaning and sanitizing programs to the needs of the operation.OSHA believes that allowing periodic cleaning and disinfecting without specifying the time period or requiring only that respirators be cleaned frequently enough to avoid hazardous exposures to residues are vague concepts which are not defined, which may be difficult to enforce and would perpetuate the poor cleaning practices which have already been shown to be a compliance problem (Ex. 33-5). Therefore, the proposal continues to require that routinely used respirators be cleaned and disinfected after each day's use and that respirators used by more than one employee be cleaned and disinfected after each use.The proposal does not state who should do the cleaning and disinfecting, only that it be done. The United Steel Workers of America (Ex. 36-46) recommended that OSHA require that the employer do the cleaning and repairing of respirators. They stated that when the employer requires that employees turn in their respirators at the end of each shift to a central cleaning facility for inspection, cleaning, and repairs by trained personnel and with the respirators returned to the employees the next day, a better cleaning program results. OSHA agrees that such a centralized cleaning and repair operation can ensure that properly cleaned and disinfected respirators are available for use, but it is not the only way to do so. For example, in plants where respirator use is infrequent or where the numbers of respirators in use are small, central facilities may be inappropriate. The employer is allowed to choose the cleaning, disinfecting and repair program that best fits the requirements of thestandard and the particular circumstances of the job. If the employer chooses to require that employees do the cleaning of respirators, then the employer must provide the cleaning and disinfecting equipment, supplies, facilities, and time for the job to be done. The proposal requires that the employer ensure that the cleaning is done properly, and that only properly cleaned and disinfected respirators are used.Storage of respirators must be done properly to ensure that the equipment is protected and not subject to environmental conditions that may cause deterioration. The proposed provisions for storage are essentially the same as the current standard. The employer must protect the stored equipment from damage, dust, sunlight, extreme temperatures, excessive moisture, or damaging chemicals. The respirator manufacturer will often provide additional information on proper storage procedures which should be observed by the employer. Storage conditions are listed in performance language. For example, temperature ranges are not specified. It appears that the degree of severity of a condition would be related to the tolerance of the particular equipment in question and would thus vary from model to model. OSHA invites comment on whether this approach is appropriate, or whether the conditions of storage should be specified in more detail.Respirators intended for emergency use shall be kept accessible to the work area. Where weathering, contamination or deterioration of the respirator could occur compartments shall be used to protect the respirator and must be clearly marked to indicate that they contain emergency respirators. This represents a change in wording of the proposed standard in response to comments on the preproposal draft (Ex. 36-45, 36-47, 36-55). Since many emergency respirators are stored in environmentally controlled areas, according to the ANSI Z88.2 respirator committee (Ex. 36-55), compartments would be unnecessary. The new wording of the proposed standard requires the use of compartments only where weathering, contamination or deterioration could occur.Respirators that are used routinely in the work area are to be stored in a plastic bag or otherwise protected from contamination or damage. The prohibition on the use of lockers or tool boxes has been removed in response to comments in the preproposal draft (Ex. 36-47, 36-49). The requirement that respirators be stored in such a way as to prevent damage should avoid problems of damage from improper storage in lockers provided the employer takes appropriate precautions.When respirators are packed or stored, the facepiece and exhalation valve must be stored in a manner that will prevent deformation. This is to prevent impairment of the elastomer due to stretching or reshaping of the facepiece or exhalation valve because of positioning of the equipment.In order to assure the continued reliability of respirator equipment it must be inspected on a regular basis. The frequency of inspection is related to the frequency of use. Respirators that are used routinely are to be inspected before each use, and during cleaning after each use. Those that are maintained in the facility for emergency use must be inspected at least monthly, and checked for proper function before and after each use. However, respirators used for emergency escape must be inspected before being carried into the workplace.The proposal has changed the requirement that employers make a record of inspection dates and findings for emergency use respirators. Employers only need certify that the required inspections have been made. The employer must perform the respirator inspection as required by paragraph (h)(3) to determine that the respirator is functioning properly and is fully charged. Then the inspection is certified by having the inspector fill in a tag or label kept with the respirator or attached to the respirator storage compartment that contains the date of the inspection, the name or signature of the inspector, and the serial number or other means of identifying the respirator that was inspected. The inspection certification need only be maintained until it is replaced by the certification of the next inspection. This replaces the requirement in the present standard that the inspection record be kept as long as the respirator is in the workplace. Since the inspection tag or label serves toindicate that the respirator has been inspected within the time limit set for inspections there is no need to maintain the first certification once a new inspection is performed and certified.Self-contained breathing apparatus are also to be inspected monthly. Air and oxygen cylinders must be maintained in a fully charged state and recharged when pressure falls to 90% of the manufacturer's recommended pressure level, and the employer must determine that the regulator and warning devices function properly.The standard specifies what constitutes a minimal respirator inspection:Respirator function, the tightness of connections and the condition of the facepiece, headstraps, valves, connecting tube, and filters, canisters or cartridges must be checked. In addition, the rubber and elastomer parts must be evaluated for pliability and signs of deterioration. It should be noted that stretching and manipulating rubber or elastomer parts with a massaging action will help keep them pliable and flexible and prevent them from taking a set during storage.The proposed standard also includes provisions related to the repair of respirators. Repairs or adjustments are to be made only by persons appropriately trained to perform them, using parts designed for that respirator. The employer is to ensure that the manufacturer's recommendations regarding the type and extent of repairs that can be performed are followed. In any case, reducing or admission valves or regulators must be returned to the manufacturer or given to an appropriately trained technician for adjustment or repair. These provisions are consistent with the requirements of the current standard.OSHA invites comments on the provisions related to the maintenance and care of respirators, including suggestions for other items which should be considered for inclusion in or deletion from this section based on the experience of those currently implementing respiratory protection programs.(I) Supplied Air Quality and UseWhere atmosphere-supplying respirators are being used to protect employees it is essential to ensure that the air being breathed is of sufficiently high quality. The current standard and this proposed revision reference a number of standard sources which establish parameters for breathing air quality.For oxygen, the employer is to ensure that it meets the requirement of the latest edition of the United State Pharmacopoeia for medical or breathing oxygen. This represents no change from the current standard.In the ANPR, comments were requested on whether acceptable respirator breathing air should continue to meet the specifications for Grade D breathing air as described in Compressed Gas Association Commodity Specification G 7.1-1966 or whether an alternate specification such as Grade E should be used. OSHA received comments stating that Grade D air is adequate and should continue to be used (Ex. 15-10, 15-18, 15-31, 15-52, 15-73, 15-75). The Los Alamos National Laboratory (Ex. 36-52) recommended that Grade E air be used, since most air that passes Grade D will also pass Grade E. However, LANL gave no specific reasons for doing so. Therefore OSHA does not believe that the need for a higher grade has been shown.In the proposal, breathing air is to meet the requirements for the grade D air classification in the ANSI/Compressed Gas Association Commodity Specification G-7.1-1989. This is the revised and current version of the G-7.1 1966 Compressed Gas Association Commodity Specification. This means that the oxygen content (v/v) must contain the amount of oxygen normally present in atmospheric air of 19.5 to 23.5 percent oxygen for synthesized air; hydrocarbon (condensed) of 5 milligram per cubic meter of air or less; carbon monoxide of 10 ppm or less, and carbon dioxide of 1,000 ppm or less. OSHA invites comments on the appropriateness of maintaining Grade D as the required quality of air.The proposal prohibits the use of compressed oxygen in atmosphere- supplying respirators or in open circuit self-contained breathing apparatus that have previously used compressed air. This is to prevent fire or explosion resulting from the high pressure oxygen coming in contact with oil or grease (Ex. 10). The proposed standard also specifies that oxygen not be used with supplied air respirators. These requirements are also in the current standard.Both the current standard and the proposal allow air for respirators to be provided from cylinders or compressors. Cylinders are required to be tested and maintained as prescribed in the Shipping Container Specification Regulations of the Department of Transportation (49 CFR Part 178).Compressors are to be constructed and situated so contaminated air cannot enter the air supply system. In addition, the compressors are to be equipped with suitable in-line air-purifying sorbent beds and filters to clean the air and assure breathing air quality. The requirement that air compressors have a receiver of sufficient capacity to permit escape from a hazardous atmosphere in the event of compressor failure has been dropped. As was pointed out in several comments on the preproposal draft, a receiver is necessary only when the wearer cannot safely stop work and leave the area without injury (Ex. 36-29, 36-32, 36-45, 36-47, 36-52, 36-54, 36-55). Since this proposal requires that respirators used in IDLH situation be either an SCBA or combination supplied air respirator with escape air supply, the need for a receiver for air compressors has been eliminated. Also the requirement for alarms to indicate compressor failure and overheating have been eliminated. In the event ofcompressor failure with a wearer using a combination supplied air respirator with escape air supply, the loss of air supply would be readily apparent, and the wearer can switch to the auxiliary escape air supply and leave the area.In the ANPR, OSHA also requested comments and input on the following questions: (1) How frequently should carbon monoxide concentrations be measured from an air compressor not equipped with a carbon monoxide alarm, and (2) Is there any reason not to require a carbon monoxide alarm on all oil lubricated compressors that provide breathing air? Responses to the issue of the frequency of carbon monoxide measurements ranged from quarterly (Ex. 15-42) to twice a month provided the air intake for the compressor is located away from contamination (Ex. 15-52), to continuously (Ex. 15-14, 15-31, 15-34, 15-50, 15-65, 15-73). John L. Henshaw of Monsanto Company stated \"One specified frequency would not be applicable under all conditions of breathing air compressor use.\" (Ex. 15-26).In response to the ANPR question regarding carbon monoxide alarms on oil lubricated compressors, numerous comments were received stating that there was no reason not to require such an alarm (Ex. 15-10, 15-18, 15-26, 15-31, 15-46, 15-59, 15-70, 15-81). One commenter, Evan Campbell of Diamond Shamrock stated, \"We recommend the installation of continuous carbon monoxide monitors with an alarm on oil lubricated air compressors operated by internal combustion engines, electric motors or auxiliary power takeoff . . .\" (Ex. 15-65). In the comments of the National Constructors Association it was indicated that screw type compressors or oil free compressors do not need a carbon monoxide alarm provided the air intake is not near a potential carbon monoxide source (Ex. 15-34).There was general recognition in the comments that contamination of the intake air on a compressor used to supply breathing air is of primary concern. Several comments cited the study published in the American Industrial Hygiene Association Journal by T.M. Distler of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory (Ex. 32-1) entitled \"Formation of Carbon Monoxide in Air Compressors\" (Ex. 15-13, 15-22, 15-26, 15-30, 15-41, 15-81). The findings of this study revealed that low pressure compressors are unlikely to reach temperatures where carbon monoxide would be produced from the lubricant; synthetic lubricants do not significantly lessen carbon monoxide production; exhaust gases from combustion engines are the major threat to the quality of the compressed air; high temperature shut-offs or alarms do not significantly protect against carbon monoxide contamination of compressed air.The preproposal draft contained provisions that required oil lubricated compressors to have carbon monoxide monitors and high temperature alarms. Freuhauf Corporation (Ex. 36-1) requested that compressors equipped with a high temperature shutdown device not be required to have carbon monoxide monitor since the compressor would be shut down before breakdown of the oil could occur. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Ex. 36-26), citing its study of compressors authored by Distler (Ex. 32-1), found no need for carbon monoxide monitors and alarms for oil lubricated compressors. However, they recommend that carbon monoxide monitoring and alarms be required for breathing air compressors powered by internal combustion engines, due to the potential for reentrainment of exhaust gases. Alan Hack (Ex. 36-29) stated that carbon monoxide alarms appear to be unreliable, there was little evidence of carbon monoxide production with oil lubricated compressors, and that OSHA should not requirethem. ASARCO (Ex. 36-39) recommended that OSHA allow the use of carbon monoxide absorption filters with visible color change indicators in place of carbon monoxide monitors. Richard Boggs of ORC (Ex. 36-47) recommended deleting section (i)(4)(v) requiring carbon monoxide monitors, citing the report on compressors performed by Distler. The Los Alamos National Laboratory (Ex. 36-52) stated that carbon monoxide alarms currently in use were unreliable, and that there was little evidence of carbon monoxide production with oil lubricated compressors. Lynnette Hendricks of the 3M Corporation (Ex. 36-54) stated that the requirement for carbon monoxide alarms added negligibly to the effort to provide quality breathing air, and that 3M was aware of no instances where oil lubricated compressor failures resulted in carbon monoxide exposure to workers. Thomas Nelson of the ANSI Z88.2 respirator committee (Ex. 36-55) recommended that the need for carbon monoxide alarms be dropped when the air intakeis located away from sources of carbon monoxide contamination. He also recommended dropping the high temperature alarm requirement. The State of Wyoming OSHA (Ex. 36-9) recommended that continuous carbon monoxide monitors with alarms be required for oil lubricated compressors operated by internal combustion engines or electric motor auxiliary power takeoffs. The International Chemical Workers Union (Ex. 36-14) stated that continuous carbon monoxide monitors and alarms for oil lubricated compressors were the only effective methods to monitor carbon monoxide concentrations.OSHA knows of one such incident which involved carbon monoxide production by an oil lubricated compressor. An MSHA Accident Investigation Report issued in January 1985 (Ex. 38-12) reported that a diesel engine powered two stage rotary air compressor that utilized oil for cooling had overheated during a sandblasting operation at a limestone quarry. This resulted in the near fatal carbon monoxide poisoning of the sandblaster who was wearing a continuous flow abrasive blasting hood which received its air from the compressor. The air compressor had a thermo bypass valve that should have normally directed the oil through a cooling radiator once the oil had reached a temperature of 185 deg. F. The thermo bypass valve failed, allowing the cooling oil temperature to rise above its flashpoint of 420 deg. F. The oil ignited in the oil separator and the fire spread to the combined oil receiver/air receiver, producing carbon monoxide. The compressor was equipped with a high temperature shutoffswitch set for 235 deg. F, but it had been disconnected for at least 30 days prior to the incident. The compressor was not equipped with a carbon monoxide filter or alarm. The air line to the respirator had an inline filter to remove oil, water, and particulates from the compressed air as it left the air receiver, but it allowed the carbon monoxide to pass through to the respirator wearer. The sandblaster collapsed from carbon monoxide poisoning. The sandblaster's assistant shut down the compressor, removed the victim's abrasive blasting hood, and called for emergency assistance. Neither of the employees performing the sandblasting operation had received any training in proper respirator use.This extremely rare incident raises serious questions about carbon monoxide filters and alarms as well as high temperature shutoff devices, and whether their use should be required for oil lubricated compressors. A properly functioning high temperature shutoff switch should have shut down the overheated compressor, but it is unclear whether this would have occurred before the carbon monoxide laden air went out to the respirator wearer. This compressor had no carbon monoxide filter with alarm to warn the respirator wearer. However, given that the high temperature alarm was previously disconnected, it is unclear whether that alarm would have been disabled as well. OSHA requests any further information regarding other incidents involving carbon monoxide production by oil lubricated compressors, and any comments on the necessity for carbon monoxide filters and alarms as well as high temperature alarms for air compressors.This proposal does not contain a requirement that carbon monoxide alarms or high temperature shutoff devices be used with oil lubricated compressors. As the Distler air compressor study (Ex. 32-1) points out, air compressors are unlikely to reach temperatures where carbon monoxide production would occur. Exhaust gases from internal combustion engines and the intake of contaminated air are the major threats to air quality, and these threats occur with all compressors, not just oil lubricated ones. The proposal requires that the air intake for compressors be placed to avoid the entry of contaminated air. One way to ensure that contaminated air does not enter the air supply would be for OSHA to require carbon monoxide filters with continuous monitoring alarms for all breathing air compressors. OSHA requests comments on whether it should adopt this requirement for all compressors. OSHA requests any information about problems with air compressor air quality, filters and alarms, and invitescomments on how best to ensure breathing air quality for respirators.OSHA is aware that in recent years devices known as ambient air movers have been developed to provide air to supplied air respirators. These units are small compressors which are not oil lubricated and have no air receiver. Such compressors may have a use in non-IDLH atmospheres. The use of ambient air movers has been allowed under an OSHA compliance directive even though such devices do not have an air receiver as required by the current standard. The proposal drops the requirement for an air receiver for compressors. An ambient air mover is just another type of air compressor, and it is treated like any other compressor under the proposal.Requirements in this proposal regarding the moisture content of compressed air for air cylinders and a provision requiring that air line couplings be incompatible with outlets for other gas systems are consistent with current accepted practice and with OSHA's current standard, having simply been updated to reflect the latest versions of the references. The proposal establishes a limitation of the moisture content of air in compressed air cylinders of no greater than 27 milliliters per cubic meter of air. This is to prevent freezing of the valves. The air coupling provision is also included to prevent inadvertent servicing of airline respirators with non-respirable gases or vapors. To accomplish this, breathing air couplings are to be made incompatible with outlets from non-respirable plant air or other gas systems.In addition, employers must use breathing gas containers marked in accordance with the American National Standard Method of Marking Portable Compressed Gas Containers to Identify the Material Contained, Z48.1-1954 (R-1971); Federal Specification BB-A 1034a, June 21, 1968, Air, Compressed for Breathing Purposes; or Interim Federal Specification GG-13-00675b, September 23, 1976, Breathing Apparatus, Self-Contained.(J) Identification of Filter, Cartridges, and CanistersThe current standard requires that the employer mark gas mask canisters with properly worded labels and color coding to ensure proper identification. However, as many commenters on the preproposal draft pointed out (Ex. 36-18, 36-19, 36-27, 36-30, 36-32, 36-34, 36-40, 36-45, 36-47, 36-49, 36-54, 36-55), the marking of filters, cartridges and canisters is the responsibility of the respirator manufacturer under the NIOSH 30 CFR 11 and 42 CFR 84 respirator certification standards. Therefore, this proposal has eliminated the requirements and tables relating to the marking of canisters from the standard. Two requirements have been added to replace the marking requirements. First, the employer must ensure that all filters, cartridges and canisters used are properly labeled and color coded. Since the manufacturer already does this, the employer need only check that the label is there. Second, the label may not be removed, obscured or defaced while in service since that would defeat itsThe most thorough respiratory protection program will not be effective if employees do not wear respirators, or if wearing them, do not do so appropriately. The only way to ensure that employees are aware of the purpose of wearing respirators, and how they are to be worn, is to train them. The record shows widespread agreement that employee training is an important part of the respiratory protection program and is essential for correct respirator use (Ex. 15-13, 15-18, 15-19, 15-22, 15-30, 15-33, 15-41, 15-45, 15-50, 15-53, 15-54, 15-67, 15-79).The current standard does not contain a separate section for training. The minimal requirements it imposes are included within other sections of the standard.This proposal retains and clarifies the present provisions in a separate section for training and provides more comprehensive guidance than does the present standard.In response to ANPR commenters who urged OSHA to mandate a program that is performance oriented and can be presented informally, (Ex. 15-13, 15-18, 15-22, 15-30, 15-41, 15-47, 15-62, 15-73, 15-75), this proposal is performance oriented in that it specfies categories of information to cover during training. It neither specifies how the training is to be performed nor the format of the employers training program. The employer can use whatever training method is effective for the particular worksite as long as it contains the topics discussed below. Employers can utilize prepared materials such as audio-visuals and slide presentations or they can use approaches ranging from formal classroom instruction to informal discussions during safety meetings (Ex. 15-53), or a combination of methods.The first category of information to be included in the training program is the nature, extent and effects of respiratory hazards to which the employee may be exposed. This includes identification of the hazardous chemicals involved, what exposure levels there would be if no respiratory protection were being used, and what the potential health effects of such exposure would be if the respirator is not worn or not worn properly. This type of information will be available on the material safety data sheet for the hazardous chemical that the chemical manufacturer will be required to produce under the Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). These training requirements on health hazards of hazardous chemicals are also required under the Hazard Communication standard (29 CFR 1910.1200) and could easily be combined into the same training program. Many commenters agreed that this subject is an essential element of training (Ex. 61-3, 61-8, 15-10, 15-14, 15-18, 15-19, 15-27A, 15-41,15-46, 15-53, 15-62, 15-73). None disagreed.Once employees are trained regarding the nature of the hazards, employers are to provide an explanation of the operation, limitations, and capabilities of the respirators selected for the employees to wear. This would include, for example, an explanation of how the respirator provides protection by either filtering the air, absorbing the vapor, or providing clean air from an uncontaminated source. Where appropriate, it also should include limitations on the equipment such as prohibitions against using an air-purifying respirator in the event of an emergency with IDLH atmospheres and an explanation of why they should not be used in such situations. In other words the employee should be able to understand the operation of the respirator thoroughly as a result of this training, and thus know why it was selected for the task at hand. Most commenters supported covering this topic in the training program. (Ex. 61-3, 15-14, 15-18, 15-27A, 15-41, 15-46, 15-53, 15-62, 15-73). There was noOnce the employee understands the nature of the hazards, and the particular equipment selected to protect against those hazards, the employer is to provide specific instruction regarding the type and frequency of respirator inspections. Although the employer is required to ensure that such inspections are performed, employees using the equipment may frequently be responsible for inspecting the respirators assigned to them. Therefore, it is necessary that they have this process explained and demonstrated to them so they are capable of recognizing any problems that may threaten the continued protective capability of the respirator. The training must include the steps employees are to follow if they discover any problems during inspection, i.e. who this should be reported to and where they can obtain replacement equipment if necessary.The training must also include the procedures for donning or removing the respirator, checking the fit and seals, and actually wearing the respirator. It is very important to ensure that the everyday respirator fit is as close as possible to the fit obtained during fit testing, and therefore employees must be able to duplicate that fit through proper donning and removal. The fit testing procedure can help in training employees, particularly if quantitative fit testing is used since it can demonstrate numerically to employees the dramatic differences in measured fit when the respirator is not adjusted properly (Ex. 15-44). The proposal requires employers to include sufficient practice so that employees can perform these tasks effectively. The proposal also includes positive and negative pressure facepiece seal checks in non-mandatory Appendix B. If other tests are equally effective in testing the face seal, they may be used. Employees must be trained regarding the appropriate tests tobe used for the respirators they are wearing. The inclusion of these topics in training was unanimously supported in the record (Ex. 61-3, 61-8, 15-10, 15-14, 15-22, 15-27A, 15-41, 15-46, 15-50, 15-62, 15-73).The employer is also to explain the procedures for maintenance and storage of respirators. This provision may vary by establishment since in some cases the employees are responsible for doing some of the maintenance and for storing the respirators while not in use, but in other facilities specific people are assigned to carry out these activities. In any event, employees should be aware of the proper procedures to follow. The significance of this point was raised by a large number of commenters (Ex. 61-3, 61-8, 15-10, 15-14, 15-27A, 15-41, 15-46, 15-50, 15-62).Respirators do malfunction on occasion, or emergency situations occur which require different respirators for the exposure levels involved. The training program must include a discussion of these possibilities, and the procedures the employer has established to deal with them. Most ANPR commenters concurred that comprehensive training is necessary where respirators are to be used in situations immediately dangerous to life or health, including oxygen deficient atmospheres, such as in fire fighting, rescue operations and confined area entry (Ex. 15-18, 15-19, 15-26, 15-31, 15-33, 15-37, 15-41, 15-47, 15-48, 15-50, 15-54, 15-55, 15-56, 15-59, 15-70).Several commenters requested that OSHA adopt the applicable training requirements of the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) Z88.2-1980 Practices for Respiratory Protection which discussed the basic training requirements of an acceptable respirator program (Ex. 15-13, 15-14, 15-26, 15-27A, 15-31, 15-44, 15-46, 15-50, 15-54, 15-55, 15-58, 15-70, 15-76, 15-81). The new training requirements are similar to the ANSI requirements for training except that the proposal does not require a discussion on the role of engineering controls.Although some commenters felt that the provisions covering training in the present standard are adequate (Ex. 15-37, 15-56, 15-75A), in view of the importance of training in motivating employees to wear respirators correctly and effectively, the additional information required by this proposal is deemed by OSHA to be critical for an effective respirator program. With the exception of the American Iron and Steel Institute (Ex. 15-37), A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company (Ex. 15-56), and the Sperry Corporation (Ex. 15-75A), the record supports further guidance for training than is currently contained in 1910.134 (Ex. 15-13, 15-14, 15-26, 15-27A, 15-31, 15-44, 15-46, 15-50, 15-54, 15-55, 15-58, 15-70, 15-76, 15-81).In addition to specific training requirements regarding the proper use of respirators, the employer must inform employees of the existence and contents of the respirator standard (29 CFR 1910.134). They must also be told of the existence and contents of the written respiratory protection program required by the respirator standard, where it is kept in the facility, and how the employee can arrange to examine it if desired.The majority of commenters agreed that annual training is necessary to assure an effective continuing program (Ex. 15-10, 15-18, 15-19, 15-20, 15-37, 15-44, 15-47, 15-48, 15-50, 15-54, 15-55, 15-71). The Sperry Corporation, however, recommended that employees be retrained every 6 months, but did not provide a rationale for their contention. In response to the preproposal draft, California OSHA (Ex. 36-44) recommended that a more comprehensive initial training and more frequent refresher training be required for employees assigned to use SCBA in potentially IDLH atmospheres; emergency response users of SCBA would receive refresher instruction in the operation inspection, and wearing of the SCBA at least every three months for the first two years following initial training, and thereafter every six months. Frank Wilcher of the International Safety Equipment Association (Ex. 36-45) also recommended that employees who use SCBAs be trained semiannually because of the higher degree ofcomplexity of these units and the possibility of greater hazards associated with their use.The Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (Ex. 36-20) recommended that training should be performed at least annually and be adjusted to the complexities of the respirator program and the level of respirator use. William O'Keefe of the American Petroleum Institute (Ex. 15-41) asserted that training should be repeated periodically, but at least every 2 years and more frequently as workplace conditions may warrant. Richard Boggs of ORC (Ex. 36-47) in response to the preproposal draft recommended that a 2 year cycle of retraining and refresher instruction after the initial respirator use training was reasonable. He recommended that any decision for more frequent training should be made by the employer. Annual retraining was called needlessly expensive. Amoco Corporation (Ex. 36-35) recommended that the retraining frequency for routinely used respirators be a minimum of two years, but emergency use respirators would require annual retraining. The American TextileManufacturers Institute (Ex. 36-18) recommended retraining every two years for employees requiring an APF of 10 or less. Both the ANSI Z88.2-1980 and Z88.2-1993 respiratory protection standards call for annual retraining.OSHA concurs with the majority of comments contending that annual training is sufficiently frequent to ensure employee cooperation and active participation in the program. Training every two years instead of annually for routinely worn respirators has been rejected, since the purpose of the training is not only to instruct wearers in proper techniques but also to encourage their cooperation and participation in the respirator program. Switching to training every two years would tend to diminish attention to proper respirator use. OSHA compliance experience has demonstrated that inadequate respirator training is a common problem (Ex. 33-5) and is often associated with respirator program deficiencies that potentially lead to employee exposures. Therefore, the proposal contains the requirement for annual training for respirator wearers. Training required by this proposal is to be given to the employee before he or she is required to wear a respirator in the workplace. Employees mustreceive training at least annually so they will be reminded regularly of the effects of the respiratory hazards to which they may be exposed and how they can prevent such exposure by proper wearing of respirators. OSHA requests comments on the frequency of training, particularly the need for increased training and more frequent refresher training for employees using SCBAs or emergency use respirators.(L) Respiratory Program EvaluationIt is inherent in respirator use that problems with protection, irritation, breathing resistance, comfort, etc. will arise. While it is not possible to eliminate all problems with wearing a respirator, the employer must try to eliminate as many problems as possible to improve protection and encourage wearer acceptance of respirators. Eliminating problems is accomplished most effectively when the program is evaluated carefully and revised as necessary. Although the current standard does require that the employer perform periodic checks of the effectiveness of the respiratory protection program, little guidance is provided regarding how this evaluation is to be done. The proposal includes a paragraph dealing with this requirement and provides more information regarding what should be assessed by the employer.The person responsible for administration of the respiratory protection program is to review the program at least annually and is to conduct frequent random inspections of the workplace to ensure that the provisions of the program are being properly implemented. The annual review is to include an assessment of each element of the program that is required to be included under paragraph (c)(1).In addition to this review of the program itself, the employer is to consult employees wearing respirators to ascertain whether they perceive any problems with the equipment. Factors to be included in this assessment are comfort; resistance to breathing; fatigue; interference with vision; interference with communication; restriction of movement; interference with job performance; and the employee's confidence in the respirators effectiveness. The employer should attempt to correct any such problem that is brought forward. Comments are requested on these requirements. Companies which have instituted similar assessments are encouraged to submit their views.(M) Recordkeeping and Access to RecordsThe final paragraph of the proposal deals with recordkeeping related to the respiratory protection program. The employer is to record, maintain and provide access to any records of medical evaluations performed under paragraph (e) of the proposal. This record consists of the employee's name, a description of the employee's duties, the physician's written opinion and recommendations on the employee's ability to use a respirator, any results of medical examinations or tests performed, and a copy of the information provided to the physician. Once generated to comply with this standard, the records are to be kept, and access is to be provided to them under the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.20, OSHA's rule on Access to Employee Exposure and Medical Records.The present standard does not contain a separate section for recordkeeping. It simply requires employers to indicate on the respirator to whom it was assigned and the date it was issued. It also requires recording of inspection dates and findings for respirators used for emergency use.The importance of recordkeeping as a means of verifying compliance with the respiratory protection program requirements was stated frequently in the record (Ex 15-18, 15-22, 15-33, 15-41, 15-47, 15-82). Commenters urged OSHA to require only those records necessary to demonstrate an effective program (Ex 15-19, 15-21, 15-41, 15-47, 15-71). However, there was considerable disagreement over what recordkeeping items to require. Because OSHA recognizes that recordkeeping may be administratively burdensome and time consuming, the Agency has only required employers to maintain records that are necessary for determining compliance with the requirements of the proposal.The written respiratory protection program itself needs to be kept current as long as respirators are in use in the workplace. However, there is no specific retention period as long as the latest version of the program is available in the workplace.Employee fit testing records are required as part of Appendix A, section (1)(L). This record consists of the employee's name, the type, brand, and size of the respirator fitted; date of the fit test; and the strip chart recording or other record of the test results where quantitative fit testing was performed. The fit test record must be maintained until the next fit test is administered. The reason for requiring that fit test records be maintained is to provide a record of the results of fit testing in order to determine whether annual fit testing has been done and if the individual tested passed the QNFT with a fit factor that was adequate for the type of respirator being used. The preproposal draft did not contain a requirement that fit test records be maintained, but several commenters had serious doubts that OSHA would be able to determine if an individual had been properly fitted and was wearing the appropriate respirator by visual observation alone (Ex 36-6, 36-17, 36-34,36-46). OSHA agrees that fit testing records must be maintained to ensure that all respirator wearers have received a fit test, that the appropriate respirator chosen by fit testing is being worn, and that retesting is performed annually. Fit testing records can also serve other uses in the respiratory protection program. The Ethyl Corporation (Ex 36-11) uses the strip chart recording of the fit test as a training tool when it is reviewed with the fit test subject.(N) Substance Specific StandardsThis proposed standard will affect OSHA's substance specific health standards. All such standards now incorporate provisions of the existing Sec. 1910.134 as part of their requirements. Moreover, some respirator related provisions in the substance specific standards differ from their counterpart provisions in this proposal, mostly in respirator selection and the events which trigger medical examinations for respirator users.OSHA is proposing to revise all references to Sec. 1910.134 in the existing substance specific standards to conform to the proposed revised standard. Thus, for standards such as lead, coke oven emissions, asbestos, and others which now require that \"the employer shall institute a respiratory protection program in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134 (b), (d), (e), and (f)\", the text will read \"the employer shall institute a respiratory protection program in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134 (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), and (l).\" The revised provisions cover program elements, selection criteria for respirators, fit testing, use of respirators, maintenance and care, air quality, training, and program evaluation. Each of these subject areas was addressed in previously incorporated paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (f) of the existing standard. For the \" carcinogen\" standards (Sec. 1910.1003-1016), which now require that in certain instances employees use certain kinds of respirators\"in accordance with 1910.134\", the regulatory text will remain unchanged. However, the employer will have to comply with the amended provisions of the revised Sec. 1910.134 rather than the earlier provisions.OSHA is including the proposed revised paragraph (e) covering medical surveillance only in the carcinogen standards in 1910.1003-1910.1016. Each of the other substance specific standards now includes in its medical surveillance requirements a provision that the employee be evaluated concerning any potential limitations on respirator use. OSHA believes that the medical surveillance programs established under these substance specific standards are therefore sufficient to protect employees who are not medically able to wear respirators. Because each medical surveillance requirement in the substance specific standards was designed as a comprehensive program to evaluate employees for conditions and risks unrelated to respirator usage as well, OSHA believes any revision changing the required frequency or content of medical examinations would unnecessarily disturb ongoing medical surveillance programs. Comments on this approach are solicited from the public, especially those who haveinformation concerning the sufficiency of medical evaluations for respirator use under substance specific standards.OSHA has adopted various approaches to deal with respirator provisions in those substance specific standards which differ from this proposal. Based on the information and data in the respiratory protection docket, OSHA believes in order to maintain an effective respirator program regardless of the contaminant or workplace conditions, there should be a minimum program level. Thus, for provisions in substance specific standards which are more protective than the counterpart revised provisions of this standard, OSHA does not propose any changes. For example, the respirator selection tables of some standards provide for more restricted use of respirators than would the respirator selection criteria in this proposal. The least protective respirator allowed by the ethylene oxide standard is a full facepiece respirator with an ethylene oxide canister regardless of protection factor required, whereas respirator selection according to this proposal would allow a half mask or quarter facepiececartridge/ canister respirator up to the NIOSH assigned protection factor of 10. OSHA believes that the more protective provisions of respirator selection adopted for specific substances after rulemaking proceedings conducted pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Act reflect the content of each rulemaking record, the toxicity and circumstances of use of each substance and therefore should be retained.In keeping with this principle of not going below the minimum program, in those cases where existing respirator selection options in the substance specific standards are less protective than would be permitted by the proposed NIOSH respirator selection tables, OSHA proposes to revise such permitted respirator selections to conform to paragraph (d). For example, the lead standard (1910.1025 (f)(2)) now allows any powered air-purifying respirator with high efficiency filters to be used in concentrations up to 1000 times the PEL, and the coke oven emissions standard allows the use of PAPRs in any concentration, whereas under this proposal respirator selection would allow powered air-purifying respirators to be used only in atmospheres of 25 and 50 times the PEL for respirators certified under 42 CFR Part 84, depending on type. In the case of new or modified respirator types as well as existing respirator types, OSHA continues to require that they be NIOSH certified for the contaminantinvolved as a prerequisite to their permitted use.OSHA is also revising the respirator related provisions in the following OSHA safety standards, Sec. 1910.94 (Ventilation), Sec. 1910.111 (Anhydrous Ammonia), Sec. 1910.252 (Welding), and Sec. 1910.262 (Pulp, Paper, and Paperboard Mills) to make them conform to the revised requirements for respirator certification, selection, and use contained in this proposal.In addition to making existing substance specific standards conform to the revised provisions of the respiratory protection standard in general, OSHA is also requesting comments on specific respirator-related issues of three specific standards.OSHA is intending to reinstate the provision in the lead standard that requires the use of high efficiency filters for all air purifying respirators used with lead. In 1979, OSHA had stayed that provision to allow further administrative reconsideration (44 FR 5446). The recent asbestos standard record that has been generated supports requiring the use of high efficiency filters with whatever respiratory protection equipment is used to protect against highly toxic substances. When OSHA announced the stay on the requirement for high efficiency filters in the lead standard, it was stated that NIOSH would be asked for further interpretation of the record. Partially in response to this request, NIOSH performed a study on the effectiveness of various filters in the presence of lead aerosols. The results of this study (Ex. 38-6) show a substantial difference in penetration between high efficiency filters and others. OSHA therefore believes there is a clear increase in protectiveness as aresult of the use of high efficiency filters in a lead aerosol atmosphere. Moreover, OSHA believes the use of high efficiency filters does not impose an undue burden on employers in relation to the use of less efficient filters, and that requiring the use of high efficiency filters in the presence of lead -- a highly toxic substance -- is both appropriate and reasonable. As a result of these considerations, OSHA intends to lift the stay on enforcement of the requirement that high efficiency filters (type III filters as defined under 42 CFR Part 84) be used.As a second issue, the OSHA asbestos standard requires the use of high efficiency filters with air-purifying respirators and does not allow the use of disposable respirators with asbestos. Reasons for not permitting the use of such respirators were that it was determined in the asbestos standard record that high efficiency filters are necessary to provide the necessary protection against penetration; and that disposable respirators for the most part also were not shown to provide adequate fit and were not by virtue of design amenable to the performance of a fit check. However, it has come to OSHA's attention that there are disposable respirators with elastomeric facepieces and high efficiency filters which are said to provide fits as good as provided by half mask elastomeric respirators which have replaceable high efficiency filters. Such disposable respirators can be quantitatively fit tested, and are designed so that fit check procedures can be performed. OSHA is asking for commentson whether such respirators should be allowed to be used under the asbestos standard.The third issue concerns the OSHA standard for inorganic arsenic. At the time this standard was promulgated in May 1978, disposable respirators with high efficiency filters were not available. Therefore, disposable respirators were not addressed in the respirator selection tables of the standard. Now that there are such respirators, OSHA needs to determine whether they can provide adequate assurance of fit so as to be suitable for inorganic arsenic which is known to be carcinogenic. OSHA is proposing that disposable respirators not be permitted under the inorganic arsenic standard for the same reasons as stated for the asbestos standard. OSHA is seeking comment on whether disposable respirators with and without elastomeric facepieces should or should not be allowed to be used under the inorganic arsenic standard in view of facepiece sealability or any other considerations.O. Maritime Standards: Parts 1915, 1917, 1918In this document OSHA is proposing to update the respiratory provisions in Shipyards, Sec. 1915.152. OSHA requests comments on the proposal and whether any changes in the proposed language is appropriate for shipyards based on relevant unique circumstances. Currently, the respiratory provision for Marine Terminals is a cross reference to Sec. 1910.134. See Secs. 1917.92 and 1917 (a)(2)(viii). The current respiratory provision for Longshoring is at Sec. 1918.102 and is many years out of date. OSHA proposed on June 2, 1994 at 59 FR 28594, 28622-3, 28690 to replace it with a cross reference to Sec. 1910.134. See proposed Sec. 1918.1(a)(12).OSHA requests comments on whether the proposed respirator standards are appropriately incorporated into the Marine Terminal and Longshoring Parts by cross reference or directly. OSHA requests comments on costs and feasibility issues for these sectors. OSHA also requests comments on whether provisions different from the general industry standard are appropriate based on unique circumstances in these sectors.P. Construction Advisory CommitteeThe revised respirator standard that results from this rulemaking will replace the existing respiratory protection standards in the construction industry (29 CFR 1926.103) and in maritime operations (29 CFR 1915.152). Since this revision affects the construction industry, the September 1985 preproposal draft standard was presented to the Construction Advisory Committee for Occupational Safety and Health (CACOSH) for their comments. The CACOSH comments, combined with the other comments received, were considered in preparing a revision of the September 1985 draft proposal.As part of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) approval process, the revised NPRM was presented at the March 1987 CACOSH meeting and the Committee's comments were presented to OSHA at the August 1987 meeting (Ex. 39). The following discussion summarizes the issues raised in these comments and presents OSHA's response to them.The proposal would replace the existing construction industry standard for respiratory protection, 29 CFR 1926.103, with the provisions of the revised 29 CFR 1910.134 respirator standard. The Construction Advisory Committee recommended that there should be a separate respirator standard for construction. Whether there were particular changes that should be made to the provisions of the standard to reflect respirator usage in the construction industry was not clearly addressed by the Committee since the comments they presented were equally applicable to general industry respirator use. OSHA believes that there is no need for a separate rulemaking for the construction industry since no differences in content would appear to be appropriate. Consequently this recommendation was not incorporated. However, OSHA is establishing these respiratory provisions explicitly in the construction standards as 29 CFR 1926.103.Paragraph (a) -- Scope and ApplicationThe Construction Advisory Committee recommended that the scope and application section, paragraph (a)(1) of the standard, require that all feasible engineering controls be used by employers and that the employer demonstrate that engineering controls are not feasible before respirators are used. The proposed change would eliminate the requirement that appropriate respirators be used while engineering controls are being installed. Since the only effect of this proposed language change would be to eliminate the required use of respirators during the installation of engineering controls, it has not been adopted.The Committee proposed that paragraph (a)(2) be modified to require that employers provide respirators at one half the PEL or TLV, and that employees be required to wear them before the PEL is exceeded. To accompany this revision the Committee proposed a new definition establishing an \"action level\" at one half the PEL for all regulated substances. OSHA does not believe it to be within the scope of this proposed standard for respirator use to trigger action levels and is therefore not incorporating this CACOSH recommendation.Paragraph (b) -- DefinitionsThe Committee suggested that the definition of an atmosphere-supplying respirator be revised to include reference to \"Grade D breathing air\". This definition was intended by OSHA to describe a particular technical device, the atmosphere-supplying respirator. The requirement for Grade D breathing air is contained in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of the proposed standard and is not relevant to the definition of the type of respirator. Therefore, the definition of atmosphere-supplying respirator has not been changed.CACOSH suggested that OSHA add a definition for \"Grade D breathing air\"to the proposal. While this term is already described in paragraph (i), Supplied Air Quality and Use, a definition for Grade D breathing air has been added in the definition section of the proposal.A definition for \"competent person\" was proposed to be added as follows:\"`Competent Person' means one who is capable of identifying existing respiratory hazards in the workplace and who has the authority to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate them, as specified in 29 CFR 1926.32(f). The duties of the competent person include at least the following: reviewing the respiratory protection program, ensuring that the employer conducts the training, fit testing, tests and maintains the records for respirators and ensuring that engineering controls in use are in proper operating condition and are functioning properly.\" This proposed definition would establish duties and authority for the competent person, who would perform the function of the respiratory program administrator required in paragraph (c)(2) of the proposal. However, the definition contains duties and responsibilities that go beyond the requirements set for a program administrator. These duties, such as ensuring that engineering controls are in proper operating condition and are functioningproperly, are the responsibility of whomever the employer chooses to designate. Although the competent person definition has not been included in this proposal, OSHA is asking for comments on the need for this definition or for alternative definitions to accomplish the same purpose.In the proposal's definition of hazardous exposure level, the ACGIH TLVs are used to determine the hazardous exposure level in the absence of a PEL. The Construction Advisory Committee recommended that the NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) should also be used along with the TLV, and that whichever was lowest to be used in determining the hazardous exposure level. OSHA agrees that the NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limits are an appropriate source for exposure limits in the absence of a PEL. However, it is not clear that the lowest value from either the TLV or REL for a particular substance should be used. OSHA has received no comment on the appropriateness of the NIOSH RELs in the docket, and is requesting comment on how OSHA should require the use of the RELs by employers in establishing hazardous exposure levels for respirator use. Language has been added to the hazardous exposure level definition to require the use of the RELs, but only in the absence of a PEL or TLV, since thesevalues are widely recognized as appropriate for such uses. OSHA requests comments on this addition and on the use of RELs in relation to TLVs.The proposal states in paragraph (d)(6) that air-purifying respirators may not be used for a hazardous chemical with poor or inadequate warning properties. The proposed standard defines adequate warning properties as detectable odor, taste, or irritation effects which are detectable and persistent at or below the hazardous exposure level. CACOSH recommended inclusion of a definition of \"inadequate warning properties\" as those associated with an odor or taste threshold equal to or greater than one-half of the substance's PEL or TLV. The CACOSH definition reduces the cutoff level for warning properties to one-half the PEL or TLV. This would reduce the number of chemicals with adequate warning properties with which air-purifying respirators can be used. OSHA requests comments and information on the appropriateness of using a cutoff level of one-half the PEL or TLV as the point where inadequate warning properties start, and on the effects such a level would have on air-purifying respiratorThe definition of \"maximum use concentration\" (MUC) in the proposal limits the use of gas and vapor air-purifying elements to a maximum level which cannot exceed the NIOSH limits on the respirator approval label. CACOSH suggested that OSHA add a sentence to the definition to limit the MUC to a maximum of 1000 ppm. NIOSH in Table 5 of their Respirator Decision Logic (Ex. 38-20) presents recommended MUC levels for gas and vapor air-purifying elements. The 1000 ppm MUC is used only for organic vapor cartridges. Different MUCs are given, based on whether the element is a cartridge, chin canister, or front-or-back-mounted canister. The MUC is limited by the NIOSH Decision Logic to the maximum listed in the table or the IDLH level of the specific organic vapor, whichever is lower. OSHA requests comments on whether it should adopt the NIOSH limitations on MUC for use in the revised OSHA respirator standard.CACOSH also suggested that OSHA add a definition for \"odor threshold\" as the concentration at which 100 percent of a human test group would detect the odor of a substance. However, odor thresholds vary greatly among individuals, a few of whom may be virtually insensitive to a large number of chemicals. A requirement that 100 percent of a human test group be able to identify the chemical could result in the elimination of most chemicals as having no odor threshold. OSHA has therefore not adopted this definition. However, OSHA is requesting comment on the appropriate levels that should be used in determining odor thresholds, the test methods used, and the appropriateness of requiring that odor threshold testing be performed for individuals who must wear air-purifying respirators.The Construction Advisory Committee also recommended replacing the proposal's definition of \"respirator\" with the following: \"`Respirator' means any device worn by an individual and intended to reduce an exposure to airborne contaminants or supply the wearer with Grade D breathing air in a contaminated or oxygen deficient atmosphere.\" OSHA believes that performance characteristics of respirators should be stated where appropriate in the standard. Some respirators are adequate while others are not. However, an inadequate respirator is still a respirator. Therefore OSHA has not adopted this CACOSH change in the definition of respirator.The Committee also proposed revising the language in the definition of service life in the proposal with the following: \"`Service Life' means the period of time it takes for a specified substance to break through a chemical or organic vapor cartridge or canister.\" Service life, as the definition in the proposal states, is a function not only of the type of substance but also of the specific concentration of that substance. Removing the specific concentration of the substance from the definition, as the CACOSH revised definition does, obscures the meaning of the definition, and therefore it has not been adopted. The NIOSH Respirator Decision Logic (Ex. 38-20) uses a broader definition that covers all air-purifying respirators as well as SCBA. It reads as follows: \"SERVICE LIFE: The length of time required for an air-purifying element to reach a specific effluent concentration. Service life is determined by the type of substance being removed, the concentration of the substance, theambient temperature, the specific elements being tested (cartridge or canister), the flow rate resistance, and the selected breakthrough value. The service life for a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is the period of time, as determined by the NIOSH certification tests, in which adequate breathing gas is supplied.\" OSHA requests comments on whether it should adopt the broader NIOSH definition of service life, replacing the definition in this proposal.Paragraph (c) -- Respirator ProgramParagraph (c)(1) of the proposal contains a requirement that the employer establish and implement a written respirator program that covers certain elements, as applicable. The Construction Advisory Committee recommended that OSHA change the word \"cover\" to \"include\" and remove the phrase \"as applicable.\" The phrase as applicable was included in the requirements to cover situations where not all the elements listed in the paragraph would be appropriate for some particular written respiratory program. For instance, if only air-purifying respirators are to be used, it would not be applicable to include in the written program the elements covering supplied air quality, the maintenance and cleaning of supplied air respirators, or fit testing of SCBAs. Therefore, OSHA has not changed the wording in the proposal.The Committee raised the issue of monitoring exposure levels in construction. They recommended that OSHA add a new element to the existing elements of the written respirator program in paragraph (c)(1) that would read as follows: \"(i) Procedures for monitoring the work environment and selecting respirators based on monitoring results for use in the workplace.\" Discussion by the Committee brought out that construction work situations are not stable, and that monitoring results for a particular individual operation would likely not be returned in time by a laboratory before that task was completed. Previous monitoring results can be used, along with past experience with similar work operations, to estimate exposure levels. The Committee then recommended that OSHA add to the standard a requirement that \"If monitoring is not done, the most protective respirator shall be used.\" In most cases this would mean using supplied air respirators or SCBAs in the absence of monitoring. The proposaldoes not now require monitoring, but it does require that where monitoring results exist, the employer evaluate them in selecting the proper respirator. OSHA requests comments and suggestions on whether monitoring should be made mandatory for making respirator selections, and what monitoring procedures should be used. OSHA also requests comments on the recommendation by CACOSH that the most protective respirator must be used in the absence of monitoring.One of the elements in the written respirator program, paragraph (c)(1)(vi), states that the program shall include procedures to ensure proper air quality for atmosphere-supplying respirators. CACOSH proposed adding the words \"quantity and flow\" to this element on air quality procedures. OSHA agrees that adding these words will provide more direction for employers on what the procedures should cover, and has revised the wording of this element accordingly.In paragraph (c)(2) CACOSH recommended that OSHA substitute the term \"competent person\" for the language \"person qualified by appropriate training and/or experience.\" This has been discussed previously in the CACOSH recommendation for a definition of \"competent person.\" The language in the proposal has not been changed, but will be reviewed in light of any comments received on the \"competent person\" definition.The written respiratory protection program, in paragraph (c)(3), is required to reflect current workplace conditions and respirator use. The Committee wanted to add the term \"training\", to require that the program reflect current workplace conditions, training and respirator use. This suggestion has not been adopted since OSHA believes that training should reflect current workplace conditions and the written respirator program, and not the reverse. It was recommended by the Committee that OSHA add to paragraph (c) a paragraph that would allow employees and designated representatives access to exposure and medical records maintained by the employer. OSHA has not adopted this suggestion, since this requirement is already included in 29 CFR 1910.20, the medical and exposure records access standard, which is referenced in this proposed standard.In paragraph (c)(5), the employer is required to make the written program available to affected employees, designated representatives, and OSHA. The Committee requested that employers be required to send a copy of the program to the OSHA Special Assistant for Construction. This suggestion has not been adopted, since no procedures exist in the Special Assistant's Office that would utilize these written programs if they were sent in. However, language has been added that would require the sending of a copy of the program to the Assistant Secretary upon request. This should meet any possible need that may arise for copies of the written program without creating an unreasonable burden.The Committee further recommended that the respirator program should be maintained and made available to employees at the job site, and that the medical and monitoring results pertaining to respirator use be available at the work site as well. How the latter would be performed, given the highly mobile nature of construction activities, was not clear. OSHA requests comments on this recommendation and any suggestions on how to provide the above information at the job site in a reasonable manner without placing an inappropriate burden on employers.Paragraph (d) -- Selection of RespiratorsIn its review of paragraph (d) of the proposal on selection of respirators, the Committee requested a new provision that would require monitoring for contaminants when air-purifying respirators are used to be sure that the maximum use concentration for the respirator type would not be exceeded. This provision is related to the requirement for monitoring that was previously discussed, and on which comments are requested.In paragraph (d)(3) of the respirator selection section of the proposal, the employer is required to evaluate certain information when selecting respirators. The information to be evaluated is listed in paragraphs (d)(3) (i) to (xi). The Committee recommended that the word \"obtain\" be added to paragraph (d)(3), to require that employers \"obtain and evaluate the following information for each work situation\". By requiring that employers both obtain and evaluate the information, the intent of the provision would be clarified. OSHA has adopted this changed language to better clarify the provision for employers.The proposal in paragraph (d)(4) requires that respirators approved by NIOSH be selected when they exist. The Committee wanted to remove the phrase \"when they exist\" since they felt that one should use the most protective respirator available, an SCBA or supplied air respirator, in cases where no approved air-purifying respirator exists. As stated in the proposal, OSHA has the option of allowing the use of non-approved respirators for certain types of exposures. The option of allowing the use of non-approved respirators has been of value in the past. An example is the ethylene oxide standard, 29 CFR 1910.1047, where the use of certain air-purifying respirators is permitted, while the use of these respirators would not have been approved by NIOSH. OSHA wants to continue to have this option with any future standard. Therefore, this recommendation has not been adopted.In paragraph (d)(6) the proposal states that air-purifying respirators shall not be used for hazardous chemicals with poor or inadequate warning properties. However, in paragraphs (d)(6) (i) and (ii) their use with such substances is allowed when permitted under an OSHA substance specific standard or when certain conditions for use are met. As discussed previously in this section the Committee wanted to include poor odor threshold as a reason for prohibiting use, and to remove paragraph (d)(6)(ii) which allows their use under limited circumstances. OSHA has asked for comments on this issue.In oxygen deficient atmospheres, the proposal in paragraph (d)(8) allows the use of air-purifying respirators in an atmosphere with an oxygen content of 19.5 percent or greater at altitudes of 14,000 feet or below. The Committee wanted to remove this provision, thus requiring the use of supplied air respirators for many work sites at altitudes where the use of air-purifying respirators has caused no problems. There was nothing presented at the meeting to support this request. The record on the issue has been discussed previously in this preamble, and OSHA is inviting further comment on this issue and on the use of air-purifying respirators at high altitudes on construction worksites.Paragraph (e) -- Medical EvaluationsIn the medical section of the proposed standard, the Committee recommended that a mandatory medical examination be required in accordance with ANSI Z88.2 and that the standard include a list of diseases and conditions which should be considered by the physician in determining an individual's ability to wear a respirator. As discussed in the section of this preamble on medical surveillance, OSHA is inviting comment on three specific alternatives for medical surveillance requirements.The medical evaluation section of the proposal in paragraph (e)(1) states that the medical provisions apply for each employee required to wear a respirator for more than five hours in any work week. The Committee wanted to eliminate the five hour per work week exemption. Their concern was that there would be many times on a construction project where employees would use respiratory protection for periods much shorter than five hours, and a situation would develop where respirators could be used without requiring a respirator physical. This issue has been discussed in the medical evaluation section of the preamble, and comments have been requested on the five-hour-in-any-work-week provision. OSHA will consider the Committee's comment, along with any other comments received, in resolving this issue.In paragraph (e)(1) of the medical evaluation provision that the Committee reviewed, the employer is required to obtain a physician's written opinion which states whether the employee has any detected medical condition which would place the employee's health at increased risk of material impairment from respirator use and any recommended limitations upon the use of respirators. The Committee suggested that OSHA revise the language in this provision to read: \"For each employee required to wear a respirator the employer shall obtain from a licensed physician a written opinion based upon any detected medical condition, which states whether the employee can wear the respirator and perform the work or whether there are limitations to type of respirator worn or work performed.\" The Committee was concerned that the original language could be interpreted as permitting the employer to know what the medical conditions were that limit respirator use. They wanted to limit the language so that theemployer would only receive from the physician an opinion on whether the employee can perform the required work while wearing a respirator or whether there is some restriction on the respirator type that can be used. The current proposal now requests comments on three alternatives for medical surveillance requirements, one of which is the provision reviewed by CACOSH. OSHA requests comments on all three alternatives and, in particular, on the need for restricting the medical opinion to only the individual's ability to wear a respirator.Employers are required in the proposal to provide the physician performing a medical evaluation with certain information concerning the types of respirators to be used and conditions under which they will be used by employees. The Committee recommended that OSHA add a provision requiring that the employer inform the physician of the contaminants the employee will be exposed to. OSHA agrees with this comment, and has added such a provision to paragraph (e)(1).In paragraph (e)(2) the employer is allowed to accept a new employee's previous medical examination or written physician's opinion on respirator use, provided it was conducted within a year of the date of employment. The Committee recommended that OSHA also require that these previously performed exams or written opinions meet the same conditions required of medical evaluations provided by the employer under paragraph (e)(1). This suggestion has been accepted, and appropriate language has been added to paragraph (e)(2) to require that the previously performed exams or opinions meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) for medical evaluations.It was recommended that OSHA add a new provision to paragraph (e) to require that the employer provide a powered air-purifying respirator or atmosphere-supplying respirator to any employee found medically unable to wear a negative pressure respirator but otherwise able to perform the task to be done. There is no applicable record in the docket upon which to base a decision. OSHA therefore, is requesting comments or information on this issue.Paragraph (f) -- Fit TestingWith respect to fit testing procedures, the Committee recommended that paragraph (f)(1) be rewritten to state that respirators shall fit the employee so no exposure above the TLV or ceiling level shall occur. OSHA has added a new provision to require that the respirator used shall reduce employee exposures in the breathing zone to below the hazardous exposure limit. This change answers the Committee comment and preserves the language of the original proposal.In paragraph (f)(2) the Committee suggested revising the language to clarify that a fit test is required whenever a different make or size respirator is used if the facial characteristics of the employee change. Facial changes are already addressed in paragraph (f)(7). Passing a fit test with one particular make and size respirator does not mean that a different respirator can be used without further fit testing. Therefore, reference to different makes and sizes has been added to paragraph (f)(2) to cover variations in respirator make and size.The Committee also wanted to limit fit testing to only tight fitting negative pressure respirators. For the reasons previously discussed in the fit testing section of the preamble, OSHA does not feel this is sufficient. Therefore, the proposal continues to require fit testing of both tight fitting air-purifying as well as tight fitting atmosphere-supplying respirators.In paragraph (f)(9) the employer is allowed to use a qualitative fit test for selecting respirators for employees who require fit factors greater than 10 in situations where outside contractors who do the quantitative fit testing are not available. A thirty day time limit is placed on this exemption from the requirement for quantitative fit testing. The Committee felt this exemption is not safe and should not be allowed. An employee who is hired between the normal visits of the quantitative fit test contractor therefore could not be assigned to any work area requiring fit factors greater than 10 until a quantitative fit test was passed. OSHA requests comments on this issue and on the Construction Advisory Committee suggestion to delete paragraph (f)(9) from the standard.Paragraph (g) -- Respirator UseIn paragraph (g)(3) of the respirator use section of the proposal, the employer is required to refuse the use of respirators that rely on a tight facepiece fit when facial conditions such as a beard or scarring would prevent such fits. The Committee wanted this provision to cover loose fitting respirators as well as tight fitting ones. However, conditions such as a beard or facial scarring would have no effect on the performance of loose fitting hoods or helmets, and OSHA therefore does not regard it as appropriate to make this change.Employees who wear corrective glasses are required in paragraph (g)(4) to wear them in a manner that does not interfere with the facepiece seal of the respirator. The Committee suggested an additional requirement that, where the employee must wear corrective lenses and the respirator requires that these be of special design, the employer shall provide the lenses at no cost to the employee. The question of who pays for respirator corrective lenses has not previously been addressed, and OSHA has no information in the docket on this issue. Therefore, OSHA requests comments and information on the responsibility for paying for specially designed corrective lenses for respirators.The cleaning, sanitizing, and discarding of disposable respirators is addressed in paragraph (g)(9) of the proposal. The Committee recommended that OSHA delete this provision since it refers to disposable respirators. In an earlier discussion of assigned protection factors, the Committee recommended that OSHA only permit the use of respirators that achieve a minimum assigned protection factor of ten. Since disposable respirators, in the Committee's opinion, could only achieve an assigned protection factor of five, their use should not be permitted. The Committee therefore recommended that paragraph (g)(9), which refers to disposable respirators, be deleted since it refers to a class of respirators which could not be used. However, after further discussion the recommendation for a minimum assigned protection factor of ten was withdrawn. Since it was this withdrawn provision that supported the Committee's recommendation to deleting any reference to disposable respirators, and disposablerespirators as a class are still covered by the proposal, the provision covering their cleaning, sanitizing and disposal has not been deleted.Paragraph (h) -- Maintenance and Care of RespiratorsIn the Maintenance and Care of Respirators section of the proposal, paragraph (h)(1) requires that respirators be cleaned and disinfected by following certain procedures. The Committee wanted to add the phrase \"on paid time\" in order to require that the cleaning not be required to be performed by employees on their own time. OSHA believes that this is not a respiratory protection issue but a labor relations issue that should be addressed by labor/management negotiation. Therefore, the suggested wording has not been added.Paragraph (k) -- TrainingThe training section of the proposal requires that employers provide a training program for employees who are required to wear respirators. The Committee wanted to add language to paragraph (k)(1) to require employers to provide, conduct and document the effectiveness of the training program. The proposal already contains the requirement that employers provide a training program, which has always been interpreted by OSHA as requiring that the training be conducted. Documenting the effectiveness would mean that some sort of testing of employee capabilities to properly use respirators after training would have to be performed. OSHA currently evaluates training programs by other means such as by seeing how respirators are being used by employees on the job and by interviewing respirator users. OSHA does not regard the suggested additional requirements proposed by the Committee as necessary for enforcement of the standard and has therefore not included them.Paragraph (m) -- RecordkeepingThe recordkeeping section of the proposal requires that employers maintain the medical evaluation record in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.20, the records access standard. The Committee wanted to add the phrase, \"and make available\", to this provision. Although already implied by the reference to the records access standard, the suggested language has been added to paragraph (m)(1)(iii) to require that employers maintain and make available this record in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.20.The Committee further wanted to add a provision that all records required by this standard be retained for a period of 30 years. The records retention provisions of the records access standard already address this issue, and duplicating those requirements is felt by OSHA to be unnecessary.Appendix B -- Recommended PracticesAppendix B of the proposal contains recommended practices for performing positive and negative pressure faceseal checks. Respirator wearers are required by paragraph (g)(10) to perform a faceseal check before entering the work area by following either the recommended faceseal check methods or by following the respirator manufacturer's recommended method. The Construction Advisory Committee wanted OSHA to add a new fit check method covering the use of isoamyl acetate or irritant smoke in an abbreviated fit check procedure. OSHA request comments on the use of isoamyl acetate or irritant smoke fit check procedures for daily faceseal tests and on appropriate procedures for performing such fit check testing using these test agents.1\\.

Public Participation -- Notice of Hearing**Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on all issues with respect to this proposed standard. These comments must be postmarked on or before February 13, 1995. Comments are to submitted in quadruplicate or 1 original (hardcopy) and 1 disk (5 1/4 or 3 1/2) on WordPerfect 5.0, 5.1, 6.0 or ASCII. Note: any information not contained on disk, e.g., studies, articles, etc., must be submitted in quadruplicate to the Docket Office, Docket No. H-049, Room N2625, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210.Writtent submissions must clearly identify the provisions of the proposal which are addressed and the position taken with respect to each issue.All written comments, data, views, and arguments that are received within the specific comment period will be made a part of the record and will be available for public inspection and copying at the above Docket Office address.Notice of Intention to Appear at the Informal HearingPursuant to section 6(b)(3) of the Act, an opportunity to submit oral testimony concerning the issues raised by the proposed standard including economic and environmental impacts, will be provided at an informal public hearing to be held in Washington, DC from March 7 to March 24, 1995. If OSHA receives sufficient requests to participate in the hearing, the hearing period may be extended or shortened if there are few requests.The hearing will commence at 9:30 a.m. on March 7, 1995, in the Auditorium, Frances Perkins Building, U.S. Department of Labor, 3rd Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20210.All persons desiring to participate at the hearing must file in quadruplicate a notice of intention to appear, postmarked on or before January 27, 1995. The notice of intention to appear, which will be available for inspection and copying at the OSHA Technical Data Center Docket Office (Room N2625), telephone (202) 219-7894, must contain the following information:1\\. The name, address, and telephone number of each person to appear;2\\. The capacity in which the person will appear;3\\. The approximate amount of time required for the presentation;4\\. The issues that will be addressed;5\\. A brief statement of the position that will be taken with respect to each issue; and6\\. Whether the party intends to submit documentary evidence and, if so, a brief summary of it.The notice of intention to appear shall be mailed to Mr. Thomas Hall, OSHA Division of Consumer Affairs, Docket H-049, Room N3649, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20210; telephone (202) 219-8617.A notice of intention to appear also may be transmitted by facsimile to (202) 219-5986, by the same date, provided the original and 3 copies are sent to the same address and postmarked no more than 3 days later.Filing of Testimony and Evidence Before the HearingAny party requesting more than ten (10) minutes for a presentation at the hearing, or who will submit documentary evidence, must provide in quadruplicate the complete text of the testimony, including any documentary evidence to be presented at the hearing. One copy shall not be stapled or bound and be suitable for copying. These materials must be provided to Mr. Thomas Hall, OSHA Division of Consumer Affairs at the address above and be postmarked no later than February 13, 1995.Each such submission will be reviewed in light of the amount of time requested in the notice of intention to appear. In those instances where the information contained in the submission does not justify the amount of time requested, a more appropriate amount of time will be allocated and the participant will be notified of that fact prior to the informal public hearing.Any party who has not substantially complied with this requirement may be limited to a ten-minute presentation, and may be requested to return for questioning at a later time.Any party who has not filed a notice of intention to appear may be allowed to testify for no more than 10 minutes as time permits, at the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, but will not be allowed to question witnesses.Notice of intention to appear, testimony and evidence will be available for inspection and copying at the Docket Office at the address above.Conduct and Nature of HearingThe hearing will commence at 9:30 a.m. on the first day. At that time, any procedural matters relating to the proceeding will be resolved.The nature of an informal rulemaking hearing is established in the legislative history of section 6 of the OSH Act and is reflected by OSHA's rules of procedure for hearings (29 CFR 1911.15(a)). Although the presiding officer is an Administrative Law Judge and limited questioning by persons who have filed notices of intention to appear is allowed on crucial issues, the proceeding is informal and legislative in type. The Agency's intent, in essence, is to provide interested persons with an opportunity to make effective oral presentations which can proceed expeditiously in the absence of procedural restraints which impede or protract the rulemaking process.Additionally, since the hearing is primarily for information gathering and clarification, it is an informal administrative proceeding rather than an adjudicative one. The technical rules of evidence, for example do not apply. The regulations that govern hearings and the pre-hearing guidelines to be issued for this hearing will ensure fairness and due process and also facilitate the development of a clear, accurate and complete record. Those rules and guidelines will be interpreted in a manner that furthers that development. Thus, questions of relevance, procedure and participation generally will be decided so as to favor development of the record.The hearing will be conducted in accordance with 29 CFR Part 1911. It should be noted that Sec. 1911.4 specifies the Assistant Secretary may upon reasonable notice issue alternative procedures to expedite proceedings or for other good cause.The hearing will be presided over by an Administrative Law Judge who makes no decision or recommendation on the merits of OSHA's proposal. The responsibility of the Administrative Law Judge is to ensure that the hearing proceeds at a reasonable pace and in an orderly manner. The Administrative Law Judge, therefore, will have all the powers necessary and appropriate to conduct a full and fair informal hearing as provided in 29 CFR Part 1911 including the powers:1\\. To regulate the course of the proceedings;2\\. To dispose of procedural requests, objections and comparable matters;3\\. To confine the presentations to the matters pertinent to the issues raised;4\\. To regulate the conduct of those present at the hearing by appropriate means;5\\. In the Judge's discretion, to question and permit the questioning of any witnesses and to limit the time for questioning; and6\\. In the Judge's discretion, to keep the record open for a reasonable, stated time (known as the post-hearing comment period) to receive written information and additional data, views and arguments from any person who has participated in the oral proceedings.OSHA recognizes that there may be interested persons or organizations who, through their knowledge of the subject matter or their experience in the field, would wish to endorse or support the whole proposal or certain provisions of the proposal. OSHA welcomes such supportive comments, including any pertinent data and cost information which may be available, in order that the record of this rulemaking will present a balanced picture of the public response on the issues involved.This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987), regarding Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting state policy options, consult with states prior to taking any actions which would restrict state policy options, and take such actions only when there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order provides for preemption of state law only if there is a clear Congressional intent for the Agency to do so. Any such preemption is to be limited to the extent possible.Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) expresses Congress' clear intent to preempt state laws relating to issues on which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety and health standards. Under the OSH Act, a state can avoid preemption only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development of such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such Plan-States must, among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment as the Federal standards. Where such standards are applicable to products distributed or used in interstate commerce, they may not unduly burden commerce and must be justified by compelling local conditions (see OSH Act, Section 18 C).The proposed Federal standards on respiratory protection addresses hazards which are not unique to any one state or region of the country. Nonetheless, states with occupational safety and health plans approved under Section 18 of the OSH Act will be able to develop their own state standards to deal with any special problems which might be encountered in a particular state. Moreover, because this standard is written in general, performance-oriented terms, there is considerable flexibility for state plans to require, and for affected employers to use, methods of compliance which are appropriate to the working conditions covered by the standard.In brief, this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking addresses a clear national problem related to occupational safety and health in general industry. Those states which have elected to participate under Section 18 of the OSH Act are not preempted by this standard, and will be able to address any special conditions within the framework of the Federal Act while ensuring that the state standards are at least as effective as that standard.The 25 states and territories with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans must adopt a comparable standard within six months of the publication dates of a final standard. These 25 states are: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, New York (for state and local government employees only), Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington, and Wyoming. Until such time as a state standard is promulgated, Federal OSHA will provide interim enforcement assistance, as appropriate, in these states.**XII.

(1) In the control of those occupational diseases caused by breathing air contaminated with harmful dusts, fogs, fumes, mists, gases, smokes, sprays, or vapors, the primary objective shall be to prevent atmospheric contamination. This shall be accomplished as far as feasible by accepted engineering control measures (for example, enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation, and substitution of less toxic materials). When effective engineering controls are not feasible, or while they are being instituted, appropriate respirators shall be used pursuant to this section.(2) Respirators shall be provided by the employer when such equipment is necessary to protect the health of the employee. The employer shall provide the respirators which are applicable and suitable for the purpose intended. The employer shall be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of a respiratory protective program which shall include the requirements outlined in paragraph (c) of this section.(b) Definitions. Adequate warning properties means the detectable characteristics of a hazardous chemical including odor, taste, and/or irritation effects which are detectable and persistent at concentrations at or below the hazardous exposure level, and exposure at these low levels does not cause olfactory fatigue.Air-purifying respirators means a respirator which is designed to remove air contaminants (i.e. dust, fumes, mists, gases, vapors, or aerosols) from the ambient air or air surrounding the respirator.Assigned protection factor means the number assigned by NIOSH to indicate the capability of a respirator to afford a certain degree of protection in terms of fit and filter/cartridge penetration.Assistant Secretary means the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, or designee.Atmosphere-supplying respirator means a respirator which supplies the wearer with air or oxygen from a source independent of the immediate ambient atmosphere.

The fit test shall be administered using either an established qualitative or quantitative fit test procedure contained in section II of Appendix A or an alternative procedure which has been developed and approved which meets the Minimum Criteria as defined in section I of Appendix A.(4) In order to use an alternative fit test procedure which meets the Minimum Criteria as defined in section I of Appendix A, the employer shall obtain advance approval from the Assistant Secretary. Once such a procedure is published by OSHA as an approved procedure in the **Federal Register** , any employer may use it without further approval.(5) The employer shall present relevant data as required by Appendix A to demonstrate that any new method used provides results comparable to or better than one or more of the established methods contained in Appendix A for the type of test, i.e. qualitative or quantitative. The employer shall be permitted to use any method for which such data have already been submitted to and approved by the Assistant Secretary. (6) Fit testing protocols. (i) The employer shall use either qualitative or quantitative fit testing for tight fitting air-purifying respirators with quarter and half mask facepieces.(A) Qualitative fit testing shall be performed in accordance with the established protocols specified in section II of Appendix A or new protocols that meet the minimum criteria contained in section I of Appendix A. If the respirator passes the qualitative test the employees may wear it in atmospheres no greater than ten times the hazardous exposure level.(B) Quantitative fit testing shall be performed in accordance with an established protocol specified in section II of Appendix A or a protocol that meets the minimum criteria contained in section I of Appendix A. The test subject shall not be permitted to wear a half mask or quarter facepiece respirator unless a minimum fit factor of one hundred (100) is obtained in the test chamber. The respirator may not be worn in concentrations greater than ten (10) times the hazardous exposure level regardless of the measured fit factor in the chamber.(ii) The employer shall use either qualitative or quantitative fit testing for tight fitting air-purifying respirators with full facepieces.(A) Qualitative fit testing shall be performed in accordance with the established protocols specified in section II of Appendix A or new protocols that meet the minimum criteria contained in section I of Appendix A. If the respirator passes the qualitative fit test the employees may wear it in atmospheres no greater than ten (10) times the hazardous exposure level.(B) Quantitative fit testing shall be performed in accordance with the established protocol specified in section II of Appendix A or a new protocol that meets the minimum criteria contained in section I of Appendix A. The test subject shall not be permitted to wear a full facepiece respirator unless a minimum fit factor of five hundred (500) is obtained in the test chamber. The full facepiece respirator may not be worn in concentrations greater than fifty (50) times the hazardous exposure level regardless of the measured fit factor in the chamber.(iii) Fit testing of tight fitting atmosphere-supplying respirators and tight fitting powered air-purifying respirators.(A) Tight fitting atmosphere-supplying respirators and tight fitting powered air-purifying respirators, i.e. half mask, quarter facepiece, and full facepiece, shall be fit tested using either qualitative or quantitative fit testing pursuant to paragraphs (f)(6)(i) (A) and (B).(B) During the test only the facepiece shall be tested without any air-supplying equipment or attachments. This may be accomplished by testing a particular respirator facepiece make, model and size (which is available for use on atmosphere-supplying air units as well as on air-purifying respirators) which is equipped with appropriate air- purifying elements.(1) Qualitative fit testing shall be performed in accordance with the established protocols specified in section II of Appendix A or a new protocol that meets the minimum criteria contained in section I of Appendix A. If the respirator wearer passes the fit test then the same respirator facepiece (i.e. make and model and size), which is available on a NIOSH approved atmosphere-supplying respirator shall be used by the employee. The respirator shall be used with an assigned protection factor as provided in paragraphs (d) (5) and (6) of this section.(2) Quantitative fit testing shall be performed in accordance with the protocol specified in Appendix A or a protocol that meets the minimum criteria contained in Appendix A. A NIOSH approved atmosphere-supplying respirator with the same respirator facepiece (make, model, size) with which the employee passed the quantitative fit test shall be used. The respirator shall be used with an assigned protection factor as provided in paragraphs (d) (5) and (6) of this section.(7) The employee shall be refitted as necessary, such as when visual observations are noted regarding an employee's condition which could affect respirator fit. Conditions to look for include facial scarring, cosmetic surgery, or an obvious change in body weight.(8) The employee, once successfully fitted, shall be given the opportunity to wear the respirator for a period of two weeks. If the respirator becomes unacceptably uncomfortable at any time, the employee shall be given the opportunity to select a different respirator facepiece and be retested.(9) Where an employer relies on an outside contractor/party to conduct quantitative fit testing and the contractor is not readily available, and where assigned protection factors greater than 10 are necessary, the employer may administer a qualitative fit test to enable the selection of a respirator provided that a quantitative fit is administered in accordance with Appendix A within thirty (30) days.(g) Use of respirators -- (1) The employer shall develop and implement written standard operating procedures for the use of respirators which anticipate possible emergency as well as routine use of respirators based on the conditions in the workplace in which they are to be used.(2) The employer shall develop and implement specific procedures for the use of respirators in atmospheres where oxygen deficiency or the concentrations of a hazardous chemical are unknown and/or potentially immediately dangerous to the life or health (IDLH) of the employees. These procedures shall include the following provisions:(i) The employees shall wear positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) or combination full facepiece pressure demand supplied air respirator with auxiliary self-contained air supply.(ii) When an employee(s) wears a respirator in IDLH, unknown or potentially IDLH atmospheres where the employee(s) could be overcome if the respiratory protection fails, the employer shall ensure that at least one additional person located outside the IDLH atmosphere is in communication with the employee(s) in the IDLH atmosphere, and able to provide effective emergency assistance; and, (iii) Where employees enter IDLH atmospheres, the employer shall ensure that they are equipped with retrieval equipment for lifting or removing them from the hazardous area, or shall ensure that equivalent provisions for rescue have been made.(iv) The emergency assistance personnel present shall be equipped with a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus.(3) The employer shall not permit negative pressure, pressure demand or positive pressure respirators which depend for effective performance on a tight facepiece-to-face seal to be worn by employees with conditions that prevent such fits. Examples of these conditions include facial hair that interferes with the facepiece seal, absence of normally worn dentures, facial scars or headgear that projects under the facepiece seal.(4) If an employee wears corrective glasses or goggles, the employer shall ensure that they are worn in such a manner that they do not interfere with the seal of the facepiece to the face of the wearer.(5) The employer shall permit employees to leave the respirator use area to wash their faces and respirator facepieces as necessary to prevent skin irritation associated with respirator use.(6) The employer shall permit employees to leave the respirator use area to change the filter elements or replace air-purifying respirators whenever they detect the warning properties of the contaminant.(7) The employer shall permit employees to leave the respirator use area to change the filter elements of air-purifying respirators whenever they detect a change in breathing resistance or chemical vapor breakthrough.(8) The employer shall ensure that respirators are immediately repaired, or discarded and replaced when they are no longer in proper original working condition.(9) The employer shall ensure that disposable respirators which cannot be cleaned and sanitized are discarded at the end of the task or the work shift, whichever comes first. A disposable respirator which can be cleaned and sanitized shall be disposed of after its useful service life has been reached.(10) The employer shall ensure that employees upon donning the respirator perform a facepiece seal check prior to entering the work area for all respirators on which such a check is possible to be performed. The recommended procedures in Appendix B or the respirator manufacturer's recommended procedures shall be used.(11) The employer shall ensure that each self-contained breathing apparatus used in IDLH atmospheres, or for emergency entry or fire fighting, is certified for a minimum service life of thirty minutes. This requirement does not apply to combination supplied air respirators with auxiliary air supply or to emergency escape SCBAs.(h) Maintenance and care of respirators -- (1) Cleaning and disinfecting.

The protocols in Appendix A on fit testing procedures are mandatory. The recommended practices in Appendix B and the medical evaluation procedures in Appendix C are nonmandatory.**Appendix A: Fit Testing Procedures (Mandatory)**1\\. In order for a new fit test method to be used by an employer a description of the fit test method and validation testing data must be submitted to OSHA for evaluation.2\\. OSHA will evaluate the method and data and if the method is found to conform to the validation criteria OSHA has established, OSHA will publish a proposed revision of 29 CFR 1910.134 under the section 6(b)(7) limited rulemaking provision of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 for public comment. OSHA will invite comments and make a final decision on the protocol after consideration of comments received on the proposal.3\\. OSHA will publish a revised 29 CFR 1910.134 incorporating the new fit test method into Appendix A.A. Minimum Criteria for a Valid Qualitative Fit Test1\\. This section applies in addition to section II.A. of Appendix A where a test method and/or test agent not identified in section II.B. of Appendix A is to be used for testing the fit of a respirator. Fit tests which meet the criteria of this section may be used to verify the fit of respirators for use up to the assigned protection factors specified in the respirator selection table in paragraph (d) of this section.2\\. Test Agents. (a) The test agent shall be relatively non, toxic. The concentrations generated during the test shall not exceed an OSHA permissible exposure limit, the ACGIH threshold limit value, or any known recommended exposure limit when there is no OSHA PEL or ACGIH TLV, and not create a health or physical hazard for the test subject or operator.(b) It shall be demonstrated that the test agent used will penetrate deficiencies in the respirator facepiece to face sealing area.(c) It shall be demonstrated that the test agent can elicit a subjective response in the test subject without fatiguing the response mechanism (i.e., smell, taste, or other relevant sensation) of the test subject.(d) A reference concentration shall be established for the test agent. It shall be demonstrated that the test subject can detect by subjective means the test agent at the reference concentration prior to commencement of the test.(e) A stable test agent concentration shall be established for purposes of challenging the fit of the respirator.(f) Where a test enclosure is used, the concentration of test agent inside the test enclosure shall exceed the product of the reference concentration of the test agent, the assigned protection factor of the respirator being tested, and a safety factor of 10. For example, if the reference concentration is 1 ppm, and the respirator being tested is a half mask with an assigned protection factor of 10, then the minimum test agent concentration would be 100 ppm.(g) Where gases/vapors are used as test agents to test air-purifying respirators, an appropriate cartridge/canister shall be utilized which affords a high degree of collection efficiency for the test agent.(h) Precautions shall be taken to avoid allowing the test agent from the fit test area to contaminate the area where the test subjects are tested to determine their response to the threshold screening concentrations. Contamination of the area where the threshold screening test is administered by the test agent from the fit test area will render any tests unacceptable.B. Validation Criteria for Qualitative Fit Tests1\\. In order to establish a QLFT method/agent as being acceptable for an APF of 10, it shall be demonstrated that at the 95% confidence level 95% of the facepieces with a fit factor less than 100 as determined by an established QNFT method will be identified.2\\. Means of establishing the 95% confidence level shall include the following procedures:(a) The respirators used in the validation procedure shall be equipped so as to permit valid QNFT testing as specified in Appendix A of this section.(b) The hoses on the test respirators shall be clamped shut and the new QLFT test administered. Immediately following the new QLFT method a QNFT shall be administered using the protocol established in section II.C. of Appendix A except that a strip chart recording of the test shall be made. The numbers of respirators, test subject size population, exercises sizes of respirators, and numbers of tests shall be sufficient to enable a determination to be made as to whether or not the 95% confidence level is attained in identifying whether 95% of facepieces with less than a fit factor or 100 will be identified by the new QLFT method.C. Minimum Criteria for a Valid Particle Counting Quantitative Fit Test1\\. This section applies in addition to sections II.A. and II.C.4.(j) of Appendix A where a test method and/or test agent not identified in section II.C. of Appendix A is to be used for testing the fit of a respirator. Fit tests which meet the criteria of this section may be used to verify the fit of respirators for use up to the assigned protection factors in paragraph (d) of this section.2\\. Aerosol/Gas Generation.(a) The aerosol/gas generator shall produce a stable test agent concentration (+/- 10%) throughout the test environment. The test agent concentration shall not vary as a function of time more than +/- 10 percent.(b) The concentration of the aerosol/gas shall not exceed an OSHA permissible exposure limit, the ACGIH threshold limit value, or any known recommended exposure limit when there is no OSHA PEL or ACGIH TLV, and not create a health or physical hazard for the test subject or operator.(c) Aerosols used to test respirators with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters shall be polydisperse with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 0.6 micrometers and a geometric standard deviation of 2. The test agent shall not be appreciably absorbed or retained in the lungs upon inhalation.(d) A test agent detection system shall be able to reliably monitor the agent concentration in the test environment and inside the respirator during the breathing cycle.(e) If it is desired to use a test agent aerosol larger than 0.6 micrometers in diameter to test respirators with other than high efficiency filters, it shall be demonstrated that the particle size is capable of penetrating deficiencies in the respirator facepiece to face sealing area, will be reliably detected by the measurement instruments, and that a significant portion will not be retained by the lungs upon inhalation.D. Validation Criteria for Quantitative Fit Test Protocols1\\. In determining the acceptability of a new method, its accuracy across the full range of measurement must be at least as great as the QNFT protocol established in section II.C. of Appendix A.2\\. Means of establishing the accuracy across the full range of measurements shall include the following procedures:(a) The respirators used in the validation procedure shall be probed and equipped with hoses as established in the QNFT procedures in Appendix A of this section.(b) Validation of a proposed new QNFT shall be accomplished using instrumentation with sufficient accuracy and precision. Accuracy and precision of the validation instrumentation shall be considered by the Assistant Secretary in determining whether to approve a proposed new protocol.(c) The numbers of respirators, test subject size population, exercises sizes of respirators, and numbers of tests shall be sufficient to enable a determination to be made as to whether or not the 95% confidence level is attained with respect to agreement between the two methods.E. Minimum Criteria for New Technology1\\. Test methods/equipment shall not alter the design, balance, integrity, manner of respirator fitting, nor distort the respirator in a manner which would result in the test respirator having different characteristics than under normal use.2\\. Equipment measuring: respirator efficiency; test agent penetration; protection factors; or fit factors must be capable of reliably detecting and measuring the test agent, protection factor or fit factor with a high degree of accuracy. The limitations of detection and test sensitivity must be known.3\\. Test respirators must be donned and adjusted in the same manner in which it will be used in the workplace.4\\. It must be demonstrated that the new technology used will produce reliable and reproducible results.5\\. There shall be a sufficient safety factor applied to account for variations in the use of the respirator and reproducibility of test results.6\\. Where test agents, aerosol or gases/vapors are used in a test environment the following shall apply:(a) The test agent concentration must be maintained below an established PEL, ACGIH TLV, or recommended exposure level and not create a health hazard or physical hazard for the test subject or associated personnel.(b) For particulate test agents:\\-- The particle size must be uniform, the concentration stable. -- Particles must be able to penetrate deficiencies in the respirator to face seal, but not be retained by the airways of respiratory tract, (c) Filters, cartridges used on the test respirator must be capable of removing 99.97% of the test agent (i.e. large particles collected on dust filters, small particles collected on high efficiency filters).(d) Detection system for test agents must be capable of detecting the concentration of test agent inside the respirator during the entire breathing cycle.F. Validation for New Technological Methods of Determining Respirator Fit1\\. In determining the acceptability of a new method, its accuracy across the full range of measurement must be at least as great as that of the QNFT protocol established in section II.C. of Appendix A.2\\. Means of establishing the accuracy across the full range of measurements shall include the following:(a) For particle counting methods, the respirators used in the validation procedure shall be probed and equipped with hoses as established in the QNFT procedures in Appendix A of this section.(b) For any method, the new test method shall be administered first. Immediately following the new method, a QNFT shall be administered using the protocol established in section II of Appendix A except that a strip chart recording of the test shall be made. The numbers of respirators, test subject size population, exercises sizes of respirators, and numbers of tests shall be sufficient to enable a determination to be made as to whether or not the 95% confidence level is attained with respect to agreement between the two methods.A. The employer shall include the following provisions in the fit test procedures. These provisions apply to both QLFT and QNFT.1\\. The test subject shall be allowed to pick the most comfortable respirator from a selection including respirators of various sizes from different manufacturers.2\\. Prior to the selection process, the test subject shall be shown how to put on a respirator, how it should be positioned on the face, how to get strap tension and how to determine a comfortable fit. A mirror shall be available to assist the subject in evaluating the fit and positioning the respirator. This instruction may not constitute the subject's formal training on respirator use, as it is only a review.3\\. The test subject shall be informed that he/she is being asked to select the respirator which provides the most comfortable fit. Each respirator represents a different size and shape, and if fitted and used properly, will provide adequate protection.4\\. The test subject shall be instructed to hold each facepiece up to the face and eliminate those which obviously do not give a comfortable fit.5\\. The more comfortable facepieces are noted; the most comfortable mask is donned and worn at least five minutes to assess comfort. Assistance in assessing comfort can be given by discussing the points in item II A.6. of this appendix. If the test subject is not familiar with using a particular respirator, the test subject shall be directed to don the mask several times and to adjust the straps each time to become adept at setting proper tension on the straps.6\\. Assessment of comfort shall include reviewing the following points with the test subject and allowing the test subject adequate time to determine the comfort of the respirator: (a) Position of the mask on the nose (b) Room for eye protection (c) Room to talk (d) Position of mask on face and cheeks 7. The following criteria shall be used to help determine the adequacy of the respirator fit:(a) Chin properly placed;(b) Adequate strap tension, not overly tightened;(c) Fit across nose bridge;(d) Respirator of proper size to span distance from nose to chin;(e) Tendency of respirator to slip;(f) Self-observation in mirror to evaluate fit and respirator position.8\\. The test subject shall conduct the negative and positive pressure fit checks as described in Appendix B or ANSI Z88.2-1980. Before conducting the negative or positive pressure test, the subject shall be told to seat the mask on the face by moving the head from side-to-side and up and down slowly while taking in a few slow deep breaths. Another facepiece shall be selected and retested if the test subject fails the fit check tests.9\\. The test shall not be conducted if there is any hair growth between the skin and the facepiece sealing surface, such as stubble beard growth, beard, or long sideburns which cross the respirator sealing surface. Any type of apparel which interferes with a satisfactory fit shall be altered or removed.10\\. If a test subject exhibits difficulty in breathing during the tests, she or he shall be referred to a physician to determine whether the test subject can wear a respirator while performing her or his duties.11\\. If at any time within the first two weeks of use the respirator becomes uncomfortable, the test subject shall be given the opportunity to select a different facepiece and to be retested.12\\. The employer shall maintain a record of the fit test administered to an employee. The record shall contain at least the following information:(a) Name of employee;(b) Type of respirator;(c) Brand, size of respirator;(d) Date of test;(e) Where QNFT is used: the fit factor, strip chart recording or other recording of the results of the test. The record shall be maintained until the next fit test is administered.13\\. Exercise regimen. Prior to the commencement of the fit test, the test subject shall be given a description of the fit test and the test subject's responsibilities during the test procedure. The description of the process shall include a description of the test exercises that the subject will be performing. The respirator to be tested shall be worn for at least 5 minutes before the start of the fit test.14\\. Test Exercises. The test subject shall perform exercises, in the test environment, in the manner described below;(a) Normal breathing. In a normal standing position, without talking, the subject shall breathe normally.(b) Deep breathing. In a normal standing position, the subject shall breathe slowly and deeply, taking caution so as to not hyperventilate.(c) Turning head side to side. Standing in place, the subject shall slowly turn his/her head from side to side between the extreme positions on each side. The head shall be held at each extreme momentarily so the subject can inhale at each side.(d) Moving head up and down. Standing in place, the subject shall slowly move his/her head up and down. The subject shall be instructed to inhale in the up position (i.e., when looking toward the ceiling).(e) Talking. The subject shall talk out loud slowly and loud enough so as to be heard clearly by the test conductor. The subject can read from a prepared text such as the Rainbow Passage, count backward from 100, or recite a memorized poem or song.(f) Grimace. The test subject shall grimace by smiling or frowning.(g) Bending over. The test subject shall bend at the waist as if he/she were to touch his/her toes. Jogging in place shall be substituted for this exercise in those test environments such as shroud type QNFT units which prohibit bending at the waist.(h) Normal breathing. Same as exercise 1. Each test exercise shall be performed for one minute except for the grimace exercise which shall be performed for 15 seconds.The test subject shall be questioned by the test conductor regarding the comfort of the respirator upon completion of the protocol. If it has become uncomfortable, another model of respirator shall be tried.B. Qualitative Fit Test (QLFT) Protocols.(a) The employer shall assign specific individuals who shall assume full responsibility for implementing the respirator qualitative fit test program.(b) The employer shall ensure that persons administering QLFT are able to prepare test solutions, calibrate equipment and perform tests properly, recognize invalid tests, and assure that test equipment is in proper working order.(c) The employer shall assure that QLFT equipment is kept clean and well maintained so as to operate at the parameters for which it was designed.2\\. Isoamyl Acetate Protocol(a) Odor threshold screening. The odor threshold screening test, performed without wearing a respirator, is intended to determine if the individual tested can detect the odor of isoamyl acetate.(1) Three 1 liter glass jars with metal lids are required.(2) Odor free water (e.g. distilled or spring water) at approximately 25 degrees C shall be used for the solutions.(3) The isoamyl acetate (IAA) (also known as isopentyl acetate) stock solution is prepared by adding 1 cc of pure IAA to 800 cc of odor free water in a 1 liter jar and shaking for 30 seconds. A new solution shall be prepared at least weekly.(4) The screening test shall be conducted in a room separate from the room used for actual fit testing. The two rooms shall be well ventilated but shall not be connected to the same recirculating ventilation system.(5) The odor test solution is prepared in a second jar by placing 0.4 cc of the stock solution into 500 cc of odor free water using a clean dropper or pipette. The solution shall be shaken for 30 seconds and allowed to stand for two to three minutes so that the IAA concentration above the liquid may reach equilibrium. This solution shall be used for only one day.(6) A test blank shall be prepared in a third jar by adding 500 cc of odor free water.(7) The odor test and test blank jars shall be labeled 1 and 2 for jar identification. Labels shall be placed on the lids so they can be periodically peeled, dried off and switched to maintain the integrity of the test.(8) The following instruction shall be typed on a card and placed on the table in front of the two test jars (i.e., 1 and 2): \"The purpose of this test is to determine if you can smell banana oil at a low concentration. The two bottles in front of you contain water. One of these bottles also contains a small amount of banana oil. Be sure the covers are on tight, then shake each bottle for two seconds. Unscrew the lid of each bottle, one at a time, and sniff at the mouth of the bottle. Indicate to the test conductor which bottle contains banana oil.\"(9) The mixtures used in the IAA odor detection test shall be prepared in an area separate from where the test is performed, in order to prevent olfactory fatigue in the subject.(10) If the test subject is unable to correctly identify the jar containing the odor test solution, the IAA qualitative fit test shall not be performed.(11) If the test subject correctly identifies the jar containing the odor test solution, the test subject may proceed to respirator selection and fit testing.(b) Isoamyl acetate fit test.(1) The fit test chamber shall be similar to a clear 55-gallon drum liner suspended inverted over a 2-foot diameter frame so that the top of the chamber is about 6 inches above the test subject's head. The inside top center of the chamber shall have a small hook attached.(2) Each respirator used for the fitting and fit testing shall be equipped with organic vapor cartridges or offer protection against organic vapors. The cartridges or masks shall be changed at least weekly.(3) After selecting, donning, and properly adjusting a respirator, the test subject shall wear it to the fit testing room. This room shall be separate from the room used for odor threshold screening and respirator selection, and shall be well ventilated, as by an exhaust fan or lab hood, to prevent general room contamination.(4) A copy of the test exercises and any prepared text from which the subject is to read shall be taped to the inside of the test chamber.(5) Upon entering the test chamber, the test subject shall be given a 6-inch by 5-inch piece of paper towel, or other porous, absorbent, single-ply material, folded in half and wetted with 0.75 cc of pure IAA. The test subject shall hang the wet towel on the hook at the top of the chamber.(6) Allow two minutes for the IAA test concentration to stabilize before starting the fit test exercises. This would be an appropriate time to talk with the test subject; to explain the fit test, the importance of his/her cooperation, and the purpose for the head exercises; or to demonstrate some of the exercises.(7) If at any time during the test, the subject detects the banana like odor of IAA, the test has failed. The subject shall quickly exit from the test chamber and leave the test area to avoid olfactory fatigue.(8) If the test has failed, the subject shall return to the selection room and remove the respirator, repeat the odor sensitivity test, select and put on another respirator, return to the test chamber and again begin the procedure described in B.2.(b) (1) through (7) of this appendix. The process continues until a respirator that fits well has been found. Should the odor sensitivity test be failed, the subject shall wait about 5 minutes before retesting. Odor sensitivity will usually have returned by this time.(9) When a respirator is found that passes the test, its efficiency shall be demonstrated for the subject by having the subject break the face seal and take a breath before exiting the chamber.(10) When the test subject leaves the chamber, the subject shall remove the saturated towel and return it to the person conducting the test. To keep the test area from becoming contaminated, the used towels shall be kept in a self sealing bag so there is no significant IAA concentration build-up in the test chamber during subsequent tests.3\\. Saccharin Solution Aerosol ProtocolThe saccharin solution aerosol QLFT protocol is the only currently available, validated test protocol for use with particulate disposable dust respirators not equipped with high-efficiency filters. The entire screening and testing procedure shall be explained to the test subject prior to the conduct of the screening test.(a) Taste threshold screening. The saccharin taste threshold screening, performed without wearing a respirator, is intended to determine whether the individual being tested can detect the taste of saccharin.(1) During threshold screening as well as during fit testing, subjects shall wear an enclosure about the head and shoulders that is approximately 12 inches in diameter by 14 inches tall with at least the front portion clear and that allows free movements of the head when a respirator is worn. An enclosure substantially similar to the 3M hood assembly, parts # FT 14 and # FT 15 combined, is adequate.(2) The test enclosure shall have a 3/4-inch hole in front of the test subject's nose and mouth area to accommodate the nebulizer nozzle.(3) The test subject shall don the test enclosure. Throughout the threshold screening test, the test subject shall breathe through his/her wide open mouth with tongue extended.(4) Using a DeVilbiss Model 40 Inhalation Medication Nebulizer the test conductor shall spray the Threshold check solution into the enclosure. This Nebulizer shall be clearly marked to distinguish it from the fit test solution nebulizer.(5) The threshold check solution consists of 0.83 grams of sodium saccharin USP in 1 cc of warm water. It can be prepared by putting 1 cc of the fit test solution (see (b)(5) below) in 100 cc of distilled water.(6) To produce the aerosol, the nebulizer bulb is firmly squeezed so that it collapses completely, then released and allowed to fully expand.(7) Ten squeezes are repeated rapidly and then the test subject is asked whether the saccharin can be tasted.(8) If the first response is negative, ten more squeezes are repeated rapidly and the test subject is again asked whether the saccharin is tasted.(9) If the second response is negative, ten more squeezes are repeated rapidly and the test subject is again asked whether the saccharin is tasted.(10) The test conductor will take note of the number of squeezes required to solicit a taste response.(11) If the saccharin is not tasted after 30 squeezes (step 10), the test subject may not perform the saccharin fit test.(12) If a taste response is elicited, the test subject shall be asked to take note of the taste for reference in the fit test.(13) Correct use of the nebulizer means that approximately 1 cc of liquid is used at a time in the nebulizer body.(14) The nebulizer shall be thoroughly rinsed in water, shaken dry, and refilled at least each morning and afternoon or at least every four hours.(b) Saccharin solution aerosol fit test procedure.(1) The test subject may not eat, drink (except plain water), or chew gum for 15 minutes before the test.(2) The fit test uses the same enclosure described in (a) above.(3) The test subject shall don the enclosure while wearing the respirator selected in section B.3.(a) of this appendix. The respirator shall be properly adjusted and equipped with a particulate filter(s).(4) A second DeVilbiss Model 40 Inhalation Medication Nebulizer is used to spray the fit test solution into the enclosure. This nebulizer shall be clearly marked to distinguish it from the screening test solution nebulizer.(5) The fit test solution is prepared by adding 83 grams of sodium saccharin to 100 cc of warm water.(6) As before, the test subject shall breathe through the wide open mouth with tongue extended.(7) The nebulizer is inserted into the hole in the front of the enclosure and the fit test solution is sprayed into the enclosure using the same number of squeezes required to elicit a taste response in the screening test.(8) After generating the aerosol the test subject shall be instructed to perform the exercises in section VII. A. 14 of this appendix.(9) Every 30 seconds the aerosol concentration shall be replenished using one half the number of squeezes as initially.(10) The test subject shall indicate to the test conductor if at any time during the fit test the taste of saccharin is detected.(11) If the taste of saccharin is detected, the fit is deemed unsatisfactory and a different respirator shall be tried.4\\. Irritant Fume Protocol(a) The respirator to be tested shall be equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters.(b) The test subject shall be allowed to smell a weak concentration of the irritant smoke before the respirator is donned to become familiar with its characteristic odor.(c) Break both ends of a ventilation smoke tube containing stannic oxychloride, such as the MSA part No. 5645, or equivalent. Attach one end of the smoke tube to a low flow air pump set to deliver 200 milliliters per minute.(d) Advise the test subject that the smoke can be irritating to the eyes and instruct the subject to keep his/her eyes closed while the test is performed.(e) The test conductor shall direct the stream of irritant smoke from the smoke tube towards the face seal area of the test subject. He/She shall begin at least 12 inches from the facepiece and gradually move to within one inch, moving around the whole perimeter of the mask.(f) The exercises identified in section VII. A. 14 above shall be performed by the test subject while the respirator seal is being challenged by the smoke.(g) Each test subject passing the smoke test without evidence of a response shall be given a sensitivity check of the smoke from the same tube once the respirator has been removed to determine whether he/she reacts to the smoke. Failure to evoke a response shall void the fit test.(h) The fit test shall be performed in a location with exhaust ventilation sufficient to prevent general contamination of the testing area by the test agent.C. Quantitative Fit Test (QNFT) Protocol.(a) The employer shall assign specific individuals who shall assume full responsibility for implementing the respirator quantitative fit test program.(b) The employer shall ensure that persons administering QNFT are able to calibrate equipment and perform tests properly, recognize invalid tests, calculate fit factors properly and assure that test equipment is in proper working order.(c) The employer shall assure that QNFT equipment is kept clean and well maintained so as to operate at the parameters for which it was designed.(a) Quantitative fit test. The test is performed in a test chamber. The normal air-purifying element of the respirator is replaced by a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter in the case of particulate QNFT aerosols or a sorbent offering contaminant penetration protection equivalent to high-efficiency filters where the QNFT test agent is a gas or vapor.(b) Challenge agent means the aerosol, gas or vapor introduced into a test chamber so that its concentration inside and outside the respirator may be measured.(c) Test subject means the person wearing the respirator for quantitative fit testing.(d) Normal standing position means standing erect and straight with arms down along the sides and looking straight ahead.(e) Maximum peak penetration method means the method of determining test agent penetration in the respirator as determined by strip chart recordings of the test. The highest peak penetration for a given exercise is taken to be representative of average penetration into the respirator for that exercise.(f) Average peak penetration method means the method of determining test agent penetration into the respirator utilizing a strip chart recorder, integrator, or computer. The agent penetration is determined by an average of the peak heights on the graph or by computer integration for each exercise except the grimace exercise. Integrators or computers which calculate the actual test agent penetration into the respirator for each exercise will also be considered to meet the requirements of the average peak penetration method.(a) Instrumentation. Aerosol generation, dilution, and measurement systems using corn oil or sodium chloride as test aerosols shall be used for quantitative fit testing except as provided for by Section I of this Appendix.(b) Test chamber. The test chamber shall be large enough to permit all test subjects to perform freely all required exercises without disturbing the challenge agent concentration or the measurement apparatus. The test chamber shall be equipped and constructed so that the challenge agent is effectively isolated from the ambient air, yet uniform in concentration throughout the chamber.(c) When testing air-purifying respirators, the normal filter or cartridge element shall be replaced with a high-efficiency particulate filter supplied by the same manufacturer.(d) The sampling instrument shall be selected so that a strip chart record may be made of the test showing the rise and fall of the challenge agent concentration with each inspiration and expiration at fit factors of at least 2,000. Integrators or computers which integrate the amount of test agent penetration leakage into the respirator for each exercise may be used provided a record of the readings is made.(e) The combination of substitute air-purifying elements, challenge agent and challenge agent concentration in the test chamber shall be such that the test subject is not exposed in excess of an established exposure limit for the challenge agent at any time during the testing process.(f) The sampling port on the test specimen respirator shall be placed and constructed so that no leakage occurs around the port (e.g. where the respirator is probed), a free air flow is allowed into the sampling line at all times and so that there is no interference with the fit or performance of the respirator.(g) The test chamber and test set up shall permit the person administering the test to observe the test subject inside the chamber during the test.(h) The equipment generating the challenge atmosphere shall maintain the concentration of challenge agent inside the test chamber constant to within a 10 percent variation for the duration of the test.(i) The time lag (interval between an event and the recording of the event on the strip chart or computer or integrator) shall be kept to a minimum. There shall be a clear association between the occurrence of an event inside the test chamber and its being recorded.(j) The sampling line tubing for the test chamber atmosphere and for the respirator sampling port shall be of equal diameter and of the same material. The length of the two lines shall be equal.(k) The exhaust flow from the test chamber shall pass through a high-efficiency filter before release.(l) When sodium chloride aerosol is used, the relative humidity inside the test chamber shall not exceed 50 percent.(m) The limitations of instrument detection shall be taken into account when determining the fit factor.(n) Test respirators shall be maintained in proper working order and inspected for deficiencies such as cracks, missing valves and gaskets, etc.4\\. Procedural Requirements(a) When performing the initial positive or negative pressure test the sampling line shall be crimped closed in order to avoid air pressure leakage during either of these tests.(b) An abbreviated screening isoamyl acetate test or irritant fume test may be utilized in order to quickly identify poor fitting respirators which passed the positive and/or negative pressure test and thus reduce the amount of QNFT time. When performing a screening isoamyl acetate test, combination high-efficiency organic vapor cartridges/canisters shall be used.(c) A reasonably stable challenge agent concentration shall be measured in the test chamber prior to testing. For canopy or shower curtain type of test units the determination of the challenge agent stability may be established after the test subject has entered the test environment.(d) Immediately after the subject enters the test chamber, the challenge agent concentration inside the respirator shall be measured to ensure that the peak penetration does not exceed 5 percent for a half mask or 1 percent for a full facepiece respirator.(e) A stable challenge concentration shall be obtained prior to the actual start of testing.(f) Respirator restraining straps shall not be overtightened for testing. The straps shall be adjusted by the wearer without assistance from other persons to give a reasonable comfortable fit typical of normal use.(g) The test shall be terminated whenever any single peak penetration exceeds 5 percent for half masks and 1 percent for full facepiece respirators. The test subject shall be refitted and retested. If two of the three required tests are terminated, the fit shall be deemed inadequate.(h) In order to successfully complete a QNFT, three successful fit tests are required. The results of each of the three independent fit tests must exceed the minimum fit factor needed for the class of respirator (e.g. quarter facepiece respirator, half mask respirator, full facepiece respirator) as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.(i) Calculation of fit factors.(1) The fit factor shall be determined for the quantitative fit test by taking the ratio of the average chamber concentration to the concentration measured inside the respirator for each test exercise except the grimace exercise.(2) The average test chamber concentration is the arithmetic average of the test chamber concentration at the beginning and of the end of the test.(3) The concentration of the challenge agent inside the respirator shall be determined by one of the following methods:(i) Average peak concentration(ii) Maximum peak concentration(iii) Integration by calculation of the area under the individual peak for each exercise except the grimace exercise. This includes computerized integration.(j) Interpretation of test results. The fit factor established by the quantitative fit testing shall be the lowest of the three fit factor values calculated from the three required fit tests.(k) The test subject shall not be permitted to wear a half mask or quarter facepiece respirator unless a minimum fit factor of 100 is obtained, or a full facepiece respirator unless a minimum fit factor of 500 is obtained.(l) Filters used for quantitative fit testing shall be replaced at least weekly or whenever increased breathing resistance is encountered, or when the test agent has altered the integrity of the filter media. Organic vapor cartridges/canisters shall be replaced daily (when used) or sooner if there is any indication of breakthrough by a test agent.A. Positive Pressure CheckClose off the exhalation valve and exhale gently into the facepiece. The face fit is considered satisfactory if a slight positive pressure can be built up inside the facepiece without any evidence of outward leakage of air at the seal. For most respirators this method of leak testing requires the wearer to first remove the exhalation valve cover before closing off the exhalation valve and then carefully replacing it after the test.B. Negative Pressure CheckClose off the inlet opening of the canister or cartridge(s) by covering with the palm of the hand(s) or by replacing the filter seal(s), inhale gently so that the facepiece collapses slightly, and hold the breath for ten seconds. If the facepiece remains in its slightly collapsed condition and no inward leakage of air is detected, the tightness of the respirator is considered satisfactory.**II. Recommended Procedures for Cleaning Respirators**A. Remove filters, cartridges, or canisters. Disassemble facepieces by removing speaking diaphragms, demand and pressure-demand valve assemblies, hoses, or any components recommended by the manufacturer. Discard or repair any defective parts.B. Wash components in 50 deg. C water with a mild detergent or with a cleaner recommended by the manufacturer. A stiff bristle (not wire) brush may be used to facilitate the removal of dirt.C. Rinse components thoroughly in clean, warm (50 deg. C maximum), preferably running water. Drain.D. When the cleaner used does not contain a disinfecting agent, respirator components should be immersed for two minutes in one of the following:1\\. Hypochlorite solution (50 ppm of chlorine) made by adding approximately one milliliter of laundry bleach to one liter of water at 50 deg. C; or, 2. Aqueous solution of iodine (50 ppm iodine) made by adding approximately 0.8 milliliters of tincture of iodine (6-8 grams ammonium and/or potassium iodine/100 cc of 45% alcohol) to one liter of water at 50 deg. C; or, 3. Other commercially available cleansers of equivalent disinfectant quality when used as directed, unless their use is recommended against by the respirator manufacturer.E. Rinse components thoroughly in clean, warm (50 deg. C maximum), preferably running water. Drain. The importance of thorough rinsing cannot be overemphasized. Detergents or disinfectants that dry on facepieces may result in dermatitis. In addition, some disinfectants may cause deterioration of rubber or corrosion of metal parts if not completely removed.F. Components should be hand-dried with a clean lint-free cloth or air-dried.G. Reassemble facepiece, replacing filters, cartridges, and canisters where necessary.H. Test the respirator to ensure that all components work properly.**Appendix C: Medical Evaluation Procedures (Nonmandatory)**This appendix contains recommended elements that should be taken into account during the performance of the required medical evaluation for respirator use. These elements should be evaluated in taking the medical history and performing the medical examination. However, the specific nature of the medical evaluation and the extent of testing performed is left for the responsible physician to determine. This recommended list of elements to be covered is not meant to limit the physician to the testing procedures recommended, since the examining physician is free to perform additional tests if necessary to determine an individual's ability to wear a respirator. This appendix is informational and is not intended, by itself, to create any additional obligations not otherwise imposed or to detract from any existing obligations.(A) The medical history should include:(1) Previously diagnosed diseases, particularly stressing known cardiovascular or respiratory diseases;(2) Problems associated with breathing during normal work activities;(3) Past problems with respirator use;(4) Past and current usage of medication;(5) Any known physical conditions which may interfere with respirator use;(6) Previous occupations; and,(7) Use of medications whose side effects might impact upon cardiopulmonary fitness.(B) The medical examination should assess:(1) Hearing ability (should be sufficient to assure communication and response to instructions and alarm systems);(2) Pulmonary function testing including spirometry for FEV(1) and FVC(*) (presence and degree of restrictive or obstructive disease or perfusion disorders);Footnote(*) In interpreting spirometry, if the FVC is less than 80 percent or the FEV(1) is less than 70 percent, restriction from respirator use should be considered.(3) Cardiovascular system (evidence of symptomatic coronary artery disease, significant arrhythmias; occurrence of frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVC's) with elevated pulse rates or uncontrolled hypertension symptoms;(4) Endocrine system (conditions which may result in sudden loss of consciousness or response capability);(5) Neurological system (inability to perform coordinated movements and conditions affecting response and consciousness);(6) Psychological condition (claustrophobia; severe anxiety);(7) Miscellaneous conditions specific to the work situation (skin conditions where occlusive materials may result in symptoms or aggravation of a pre-existing dermatitis); and,(8) Exercise stress (for those employees who use a self-contained breathing apparatus or rebreather type respirator under strenuous work conditions or in emergencies, particularly in fire and rescue operations).**XV.

El viaje deber\u00eda haber sido una oportunidad para que la monarca se relajara tras un a\u00f1o dif\u00edcil en el que falleci\u00f3 su marido, el pr\u00edncipe Felipe, y pasara tiempo con sus seres queridos, que visitan habitualmente la remota finca victoriana en el valle del Dee, en Escocia. En cambio, a menos de 24 horas del comienzo de las vacaciones, la familia real brit\u00e1nica se vio arrastrada de nuevo a una crisis cuando se supo que el pr\u00edncipe Andr\u00e9s hab\u00eda sido demandado en Nueva York por una mujer que alega haber sufrido abusos sexuales por parte del miembro de la realeza cuando ten\u00eda 17 a\u00f1os.\u00bfQui\u00e9n es el pr\u00edncipe Andr\u00e9s? La historia del \"heredero de repuesto\" que se enfrenta a una demanda por abuso sexualEsta no es la primera vez que un miembro de la familia se enfrenta a una acci\u00f3n legal, dice la historiadora de CNN y experta en la realeza Kate Williams. Se\u00f1ala que el pr\u00edncipe Carlos fue demandado por un estudiante de derecho en 1978 tras una aparici\u00f3n en Ohio. El estudiante lo demand\u00f3 por supuesta privaci\u00f3n de \"varios derechos garantizados por la Constituci\u00f3n (de EE.UU.)\", (aunque el caso no prosper\u00f3). Y en 2002, la princesa Ana se convirti\u00f3 en el primer miembro de la familia real en ser condenado por un delito penal, declar\u00e1ndose culpable de una acusaci\u00f3n debido a que su perro mordi\u00f3 a dos ni\u00f1os en un parque. Pero esos casos palidecen en comparaci\u00f3n con las acusaciones de agresi\u00f3n sexual a una menor.Andr\u00e9s en el funeral de su padre en abril.Cr\u00e9ditos: Chris Jackson/Pool/AFP/Getty ImagesLas acusaciones de Virginia Roberts Giuffre no son nuevas, pero es la primera vez que presenta una demanda civil contra el noveno en la l\u00ednea de sucesi\u00f3n al trono brit\u00e1nico, solicitando una indemnizaci\u00f3n por da\u00f1os y perjuicios que se determinar\u00e1 en el juicio. Un representante del equipo legal del duque declin\u00f3 hacer comentarios sobre el nuevo litigio el martes, al igual que el Palacio de Buckingham.Virginia Giuffre presenta una demanda contra el pr\u00edncipe Andr\u00e9s alegando abuso sexualTradicionalmente, la familia real ha adoptado el mantra de \"nunca te quejes, nunca des explicaciones\". Pero esa estrategia de gesti\u00f3n de crisis a base de silencio puede no ser suficiente esta vez.A lo largo de los a\u00f1os, Andr\u00e9s se ha convertido en un personaje recurrente en la saga de Jeffrey Epstein. Ya en 2019, se sent\u00f3 con la BBC para responder a las preguntas sobre sus v\u00ednculos con el difunto financiero ca\u00eddo en desgracia y neg\u00f3 en\u00e9rgicamente las acusaciones de Giuffre, diciendo inequ\u00edvocamente que \"nunca sucedi\u00f3\". Estas declaraciones provocaron una crisis de relaciones p\u00fablicas que \u00e9l mismo provoc\u00f3.Esa entrevista, realizada en los terrenos del palacio, encendi\u00f3 una tormenta por la aparente falta de simpat\u00eda de Andr\u00e9s hacia las presuntas v\u00edctimas de Epstein. La desastrosa entrevista tuvo como resultado el exilio efectivo del pr\u00edncipe de sus funciones reales. En un comunicado de entonces, Andr\u00e9s dijo que se retiraba \"en un futuro previsible\" y prometi\u00f3 \"ayudar a cualquier agencia de la ley apropiada en sus investigaciones, si as\u00ed lo requieren\". Desde entonces, Andr\u00e9s se ha mantenido alejado de la escena p\u00fablica y ha optado por refugiarse en su residencia real de Windsor.A pesar de su promesa p\u00fablica de ayudar a los funcionarios que investigan la presunta red sexual que una vez oper\u00f3 Epstein y sus asociados, los funcionarios de Estados Unidos dicen lo contrario. En enero de 2020, el entonces Fiscal del Distrito Sur de Nueva York, Geoffrey Berman, reclam\u00f3 al pr\u00edncipe, diciendo que hab\u00eda \"proporcionado cero cooperaci\u00f3n\". Los abogados de Giuffre tambi\u00e9n dicen que el equipo legal de Andr\u00e9s ha estado \"bloqueando\" sus esfuerzos para obtener informaci\u00f3n durante el \u00faltimo a\u00f1o, dejando el litigio como el \u00fanico curso de acci\u00f3n, lo que nos lleva a donde estamos hoy.Las opciones de Andr\u00e9s en este momento no son en absoluto claras. Seg\u00fan Melissa Murray, profesora de Derecho de la Universidad de Nueva York, si el equipo legal de Andr\u00e9s decide no presentarse a la demanda civil, podr\u00eda exponerse a un juicio directo y a una posible reclamaci\u00f3n por da\u00f1os y perjuicios. \"Lo que (Giuffre) busca aqu\u00ed no es su encarcelamiento, no es una declaraci\u00f3n de culpabilidad, no es un proceso penal. Es simplemente una demanda civil para obtener una indemnizaci\u00f3n por da\u00f1os y perjuicios\", explica Murray.Los casos civiles de este tipo rara vez llegan a la fase de juicio con jurado, dice Murray, y en su lugar se resuelven m\u00e1s com\u00fanmente a trav\u00e9s de un juicio sumario o mediante un acuerdo extrajudicial, este \u00faltimo podr\u00eda ser un problema para la realeza.\"\u00c9l ha declarado que no tuvo nada que ver con ella... por lo que cualquier esfuerzo para llegar a un acuerdo en este momento parecer\u00eda ser una declaraci\u00f3n de que hay algo de verdad en sus acusaciones\", explica Murray.Cabe se\u00f1alar que Andr\u00e9s nunca se ha enfrentado a cargos penales. Pero Murray se\u00f1ala que si se permitiera que el caso siguiera adelante, podr\u00eda exponer a la realeza a un mayor escrutinio.\"Permitir que esto siga adelante, que se descubra, que se tomen declaraciones, que se presenten pruebas, significa que cualquier cosa que surja en esta demanda civil y que se haga p\u00fablica puede servir de base para presentar cargos penales contra \u00e9l, o contra cualquier otra persona cuyo nombre salga a la luz en esta disputa en particular\", dice.\"Tiene mucha exposici\u00f3n general y cosas en las que pensar en este momento\".La reina y el pr\u00edncipe Andr\u00e9s viajan juntos a un servicio religioso el 11 de agosto de 2019, un d\u00eda despu\u00e9s de que Epstein falleciera por suicidio.Cr\u00e9ditos: Duncan McGlynn/Getty ImagesCualquiera que sea la forma en que se desarrolle la presentaci\u00f3n en la corte, tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 la pesadilla de relaciones p\u00fablicas que la familia debe navegar ahora, con comentaristas reales y expertos legales que sugieren que puede no haber vuelta atr\u00e1s para Andr\u00e9s.Nigel Cawthorne, autor de \"Prince Andrew: Epstein and the Palace\", dice que parece haber poco recurso para que el duque vuelva a sus funciones p\u00fablicas. \"Es muy dif\u00edcil ver c\u00f3mo puede volver a la primera l\u00ednea de la monarqu\u00eda, como ha expresado su deseo, con esta demanda pendiente o si un tribunal falla en su contra por ausencia\".Alex McCready, jefe de reputaci\u00f3n y privacidad del bufete de abogados londinense Vardags, especializado en llevar los casos de clientes de alto perfil, coincide en que las consecuencias de la demanda podr\u00edan da\u00f1ar la reputaci\u00f3n de la familia.Bill Gates dice que lamenta el tiempo que pas\u00f3 con Jeffrey Epstein: \"Fue un gran error\"\"Un enfoque de 'ignorar el problema y esperar a que pase' por parte de la familia real atraer\u00e1 inevitablemente las cr\u00edticas de muchos sectores\", afirma. \"Sea cual sea el camino que elija el pr\u00edncipe Andr\u00e9s, ya se ha hecho un da\u00f1o importante a su propia reputaci\u00f3n y, posiblemente, a la familia real en general, que ser\u00e1 dif\u00edcil de mitigar\".Dif\u00edcil, pero no imposible, seg\u00fan Amber Melville-Brown, jefa de medios y reputaci\u00f3n del bufete internacional Withers.\"Como dijo el pr\u00edncipe Carlos al locutor y escritor Jeremy Paxman, la familia real es, despu\u00e9s de todo, un telenovela. Pero si ese es el caso, la serie no va a ser cancelada pronto\", dice Melville-Brown. \"La monarqu\u00eda es m\u00e1s que la suma de sus partes familiares. A pesar del ataque a la reputaci\u00f3n, es una serie que no ser\u00e1 cancelada, incluso en la cultura de la cancelaci\u00f3n de hoy en d\u00eda\".La reina se encuentra con los pr\u00edncipes Carlos y Andr\u00e9s durante un sobrevuelo del Palacio de Buckingham en 2019.Cr\u00e9dito: Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty ImagesY a\u00f1ade: \"No hay una 'salsa secreta' de rehabilitaci\u00f3n de la reputaci\u00f3n que se adapte a todos los gustos. La aceptaci\u00f3n, el arrepentimiento, la responsabilidad son algunos de los ingredientes, la dignidad, la empat\u00eda y la positividad otros, mientras que seguir haciendo el trabajo es un elemento clave\".Y ah\u00ed es donde la reina destaca, porque todo lo que ha hecho a lo largo de su largo reinado ha sido al servicio de sus dominios.A pesar de esta crisis, no hay evidencia de que la reputaci\u00f3n de la monarca se haya visto empa\u00f1ada por el esc\u00e1ndalo todav\u00eda. Pero en la era del #MeToo y en medio de un ajuste de cuentas global sobre la raza, la autoridad y los privilegios, eso podr\u00eda cambiar y Andr\u00e9s ser\u00e1 sin duda consciente de la importancia de sus pr\u00f3ximos movimientos.Ivana Kottasov\u00e1, Nina dos Santos y Ghazi Balkiz de CNN contribuyeron con este reportaje.\u2122 & (C) 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Photograph: Martin Rowson/National Portrait Gallery LondonSun 12 Sep 2021 10.30 BSTFor nearly two decades a series of irreverent political cartoons graced an entire wall of the celebrated Gay Hussar restaurant in London\u2019s Soho \u2013 a snapshot of Westminster life that delighted tourists and regulars alike.From Michael Foot\u2019s distinctive white tresses to a glowering Alastair Campbell, the 63 caricatures of leading political figures drawn over lunch are now to be shared with a wider audience, thanks to a joint gift to the National Portrait Gallery by their creator Martin Rowson and Corus Hotels, which ran the Soho establishment until its closure in June 2018. A new restaurant opened on the site in September 2020.Rowson at the Gay Hussar in 2007. Photograph: Nick Cunard/Rex\u201cIndividually they are worth little but as a collection I like to think that they have some historic merit and reflect an important period in our political life,\u201d reflects Rowson. \u201cThis [the restaurant] was an extraordinary place where politicians mingled with journalists for lengthy, booze-fuelled lunches which would be unthinkable now. It was a hotbed of plotting, backstabbing, deal-making and gossip. The original idea behind the drawings was to capture a slice of that and later I thought it was important to try to keep them together.\u201dFor 65 years - since opening in 1953 until its closure in 2018 \u2013 the Gay Hussar played host to generations of politicians, writers and artists with a Hungarian-style meaty menu that barely changed.The Gay Hussar in Soho, London. The Hungarian restaurant was \u201can extraordinary place where politicians mingled with journalists for lengthy, booze-fuelled lunches which would be unthinkable now\u201d, said Martin Rowson. Photograph: AlamyThe black and white drawings were penned between 2000 and 2011 by Rowson, an award-winning political cartoonist, illustrator and self-confessed \u201cranter\u201d known for his satirical and typically unflattering portraits.Labour cabinet ministers, MPs, spin doctors, trade union barons and journalists from leftwing newspapers \u2013 including this one \u2013 who were regular diners, dominate the gallery of the great and not so good, while there is also a smattering of Tory MPs who flocked to the haunt.Bill Morris by Martin Rowson, pen and ink, 29 May 2002. Illustration: National Portrait Gallery London/\u00a9 Martin RowsonConfirming the old adage that there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch, in 2000 Rowson \u2013 a devotee himself and attendee of the legendary dinners organised by _Tribune_ magazine \u2013 had suggested to the restaurant\u2019s manager, John Wrobel, that he should draw its \u201ccelebrity clientele\u201d. The sitters were given a free meal in return and the drawings framed and displayed on the walls.\u201cThey gradually replaced some plates and pictures of Hungarian peasants but we reached full capacity by 2005 and the rest migrated upstairs,\u201d Rowson recalls.All the drawings are dated and signed by the sitter even if not all \u2013 including one-time _Guardian_ political editor Ian Aitken who declared his own image \u201cinsufficiently jolly\u201d \u2013 were thrilled by the results.Former Labour Party leader Michael Foot was the first subject in early 2000 \u2013 at the age of 88 still eating in the restaurant.The era was known for the rise of New Labour following Tony Blair\u2019s landslide election victory in May 1997. Blair\u2019s spin doctor, Campbell \u2013 drawn in May 2002 \u2013 sat and glowered at Rowson with his arms crossed and declared at the end (with expletives) that the work looked more like Jeremy Paxman.\u201cWhat is disappointing is that there are so few women,\u201d notes Rowson, which he admits could be down to an offputting blokey dining culture rather than a shortage of females in the Labour ranks.Undeterred was cabinet minister Mo Mowlam, who made a necklace of chilli pepper table decorations during her sitting and fled in agony into the night after rubbing her eyes.Rowson\u2019s big regret is having not drawn veteran Labour MP and minister Barbara Castle who died before she was able to sit for him.Michael Heseltine by Martin Rowson, pen and ink, 10 July 2002. Photograph: National Portrait Gallery London/\u00a9 Martin RowsonRowson fears that trade unionists are in danger of being \u201cforgotten by history\u201d, lamenting the fact that the only portrait to have gone missing is that of veteran leader Jack Jones. He sketched him with his friend and fellow trade union heavyweight Rodney Bickerstaffe in 2002 as they downed champagne and absinthe.The future of the collection had been plunged into doubt because of a lack of clarity about ownership. When the restaurant closed its doors in June 2018 its owner removed them and put them into storage for safe keeping.Rowson and Corus Hotels each ran up legal fees as they sought to establish ownership but then called a truce and last year agreed to offer the collection to the National Portrait Gallery as a joint gift.Paul Cox, curator at the National Portrait Gallery, said the NPG was extremely grateful for the \u201cgenerous\u201d gift and that it would be in good company.\u201cThe Gay Hussar drawings follow the tradition of satirical caricature portraits of politics and social life established by artists such as James Gillray, who has over 800 works in the collection,\u201d he said.## Gay Hussar restaurant ditches old-time spicy gossip for modern Soho vibe\u201cThey can also be seen as a collection of political portraits comparable with the gallery\u2019s portraits of members of the [18th century] Kit-Cat Club by Sir Godfrey Kneller, which was also associated with an eating establishment \u2013 Christopher Cat\u2019s tavern near Temple Bar, where he sold the mutton pies known as Kit-cats from which the club took its name.\u201dThe drawings are now available for members of the public to view online, and may eventually be featured in exhibitions once the National Portrait Gallery \u2013 closed until 2023 for a major redevelopment \u2013 reopens.Meanwhile the restaurant will this month celebrate its first anniversary under the management of the owners of Noble Rot wine bar in Bloomsbury.Support The GuardianAvailable for everyone, funded by readersBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He enjoys nearly three tenths of breathing space at the top by the end of play, with Aleix Espargaro (Aprilia Racing Team Gresini) next up at a venue he and his machine have enjoyed some good success at - carrying that momentum from Silverstone. Third went the way of Cal Crutchlow (Monster Energy Yamaha MotoGP) as the Brit pulled a seriously fast one to complete the top three on Day 1, and the number 35 was top Yamaha to boot. The top 17 were covered by nine tenths on Friday, and from second to 21st it's just a single second.Marc Marquez (Repsol Honda Team) started the day with a statement. The eight-time World Champion laid down a 1:48.048, putting him a whopping 0.971 clear of reigning Champion Joan Mir (Team Suzuki Ecstar). However, Mir did get within almost half a second on his final flying lap before that was cancelled, so the Suzuki rider seemed to have a little more in the locker initially\u2026Over a second off the number 93, Francesco Bagnaia (Ducati Lenovo Team) was a consistent presence near the top as he ended the session in third, with Alex Marquez (LCR Honda Castrol) taking fourth with a late move up the timesheets to within 0.013 of the Italian. Thick and fast thereafter came Miller, Aleix Espargaro, Johann Zarco (Pramac Racing), Championship leader Fabio Quartararo (Monster Energy Yamaha MotoGP) and Takaaki Nakagami (LCR Honda Idemitsu), with gaps ranging from 0.008 between the latter two and up to a maximum of 0.079 between Zarco and Quartararo. Close? Very. Pol Espargaro (Repsol Honda Team) completed the top ten, 0.130 off Nakagami.On Maverick Vi\u00f1ales (Aprilia Racing Team Gresini) watch, the Spaniard did 21 laps and got down to a 1:50.187 in his first official session with the Noale factory - about a second off Bagnaia in third.Iker Lecuona (Tech 3 KTM Factory Racing) crashed early in the session, rider ok, before Valentino Rossi (Petronas Yamaha SRT) took a tumble in the latter stages at Turn 5, rider also ok.Fortunes changed as Marc Marquez grabbed more headlines but this time for a crash, with number 93 sliding out from behind Alex Marquez. Rider ok but clearly demonstrated his frustration, and he didn't improve so ended up in P20 on the FP2 timesheets\u2026 just ahead of Joan Mir in a real reversal of FP1 for the two.That was despite the number 93 still leading the combined times with five minutes to go too, but a final flurry of activity in the afternoon saw everything change. Aleix Espargaro and Lecuona charged, then Miller set down his serious marker to beat Marc Marquez' FP1 best by a margin. Aleix Espargaro did that next, before Crutchlow put in a stunner to slot into second.Quartararo pipped the FP1 marker next, with Bagnaia - who also crashed earlier in the session - then pipping the Frenchman too and slotting into fourth. Next came Jorge Martin (Pramac Racing), before his team-mate Johann Zarco was the final mover and shaker. Almost literally, as the Frenchman leapt up more than ten places despite a serious front end moment on his final lap.After the mad dash to the top, the combined timesheets saw everyone improve in the afternoon minus Marc Marquez. So Miller reigns with 0.273 in hand over Aleix Espargaro, with Crutchlow ending the day just 0.011 further back as top Yamaha, seriously impressing as his stand-in duty continues.Zarco takes fourth ahead of Martin and Bagnaia - that's four Ducatis in the top six as they show early promise of having moved forward a lot since our last visit to Aragon - and the margins remain tiny. Quartararo is P7, 0.002 off Bagnaia.Eighth is where Marc Marquez' FP1 chart-toppper fits in, 0.014 slower than El Diablo's best from the afternoon, with Nakagami in ninth and Enea Bastianini (Avintia Esponsorama) completing an impressive day in tenth overall - and therefore the last rider currently on to take a place in Q2.That leaves Pol Espargaro out as it stands, down in P11, with last year's Aragon winner Alex Rins (Team Suzuki Ecstar) in P12. The comes Brad Binder (Red Bull KTM Factory Racing), with a new chassis for the Austrian factory to explore too.Mir ends the day in P21, Rossi in P19 and Vi\u00f1ales splits the two, although on a slightly different mission to those around him. The number 12 ended the day 1.142 off Miller after his first two official sessions with Aprilia.\u201cThis is definitely the best way to start the weekend, and it's a result that instils confidence. We found the track in good conditions right from the start. To be honest, I was surprised; given the rain that fell last night and the dust on the track, I expected a much more slippery asphalt, but the track was fast, and the grip allowed us to push immediately. This morning, I was able to have a good pace with used tyres, but I was not satisfied with it this afternoon. In FP2, we tried a couple of things that maybe took us in the wrong direction, but once we got back to the morning setup, I found my pace again. There are still some areas we can work on, but overall we are doing well. Now the goal is to continue to be fast. There are many competitive riders here at Arag\u00f3n, so it will be important to improve consistently, to be among the protagonists in Sunday\u2019s race\u201d.\"I am extremely satisfied with today\u2019s results, both on the time attack front and in terms of our work with used tyres in view of the race. If I'm honest, I still don\u2019t have that perfect feeling. I'm able to be fast, but in terms of feeling, I think there is still room for improvement. This morning, the grip on the asphalt was very poor and then it gradually got better, but thinking ahead to Sunday, when rather high temperatures are expected, we will clearly need to work well on tyre choice and setup.\"\u201cI wasn\u2018t surprised by the lap I did after that first sector. I knew that first sector was already a good one for me, so I knew while I was going on with the rest of the lap that I would be okay. The first sector isn\u2018t always my best sector, and I took it easy because I was a bit scared of Turn 2 with the cold front tyre. But after that I was okay. It was nice to do that lap. I haven\u2018t pushed and done a lap like that all year, so it was about time to try and do one \u2013 and I did. We had a good day today. It was nice to be able to get up there on the timesheets, but I don\u2018t care about the position. Of course, we want to go fast, but it\u2018s more about giving information about how I feel with the bike. I tried a few new things today. As a test rider, that\u2018s my job. It was good to go fast and push the bike to my limit.\u201d\u201cI am happy with today and I have found the right feeling. In FP2, I was able to put out a fast lap and I hope to continue on this path tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI didn't hope to be competitive today, This is not one of the easiest tracks for the Ducati bike and it require a lot of physical effort. My goal is to be in the top ten tomorrow after FP3 and have a good qualifying session.\u201d\u201cI'm pleased with the result obtained on this first day at the MotorLand Arag\u00f3n. Last year, we Ducati riders struggled a lot on this track, but today we were able to be fast right from the start, which shows that we did a great job on our Desmosedici GP. We already have a good base setup, and in the two sessions today, we tried different tyres, except the hard front, and we were able to be competitive with all of them. I'm satisfied with the work done on this first day, and I'm confident that we can do well also in qualifying tomorrow\u201d.\u201cI feel great. FP1 was tough because I was trying some tyres and didn\u2018t really feel great on the bike. This afternoon with the hard-hard tyre combination was much better. I tried something on the second run that I didn\u2018t like, and then during the time attack I ran into some traffic. But I\u2018m happy because I know I could achieve a time that\u2018s close to today\u2018s top time. I\u2018m quite satisfied and I didn\u2018t expect to make those fast laps in the first run, so I\u2018m pretty confident.\u201dBecome a Patron for MCNews!\u201cWe had a perfect plan; a new tyre in FP1 and then work on the race in FP2 but with the crash we changed our plan a bit. It did give us a chance to test the hard rear so it hasn\u2019t impacted our race weekend a lot. For sure when I fell I was frustrated because I was feeling under control. Yes, I was behind Alex with the slip stream and braking slightly later but I knew I was too fast and I tried to go wide, but then I hit the dirty part of the track and fell. That\u2019s why I was frustrated with the fall. I only pushed for a couple of laps today to save some energy, but so far when I push for race pace the lap time has been coming.\u201dMarc Marquez got caught out while following his brother\u201cIt was a good start for us today and we had a good feeling on the bike so far. The track condition this morning wasn\u2019t great, but it improved in FP2 as there was more rubber on the track so everyone was able to improve their lap time. So I\u2019m really looking forward to tomorrow in FP3 and the qualifying sessions, we need to stay in the top 10 in FP3 and be ready for Q2.\u201d\"It was a positive day, where I started off on the right foot. I was able to enjoy FP1, but in FP2 I didn't feel quite comfortable, because I didn't feel a good grip with the front tyre. Fortunately, the time attack was good and I managed to set a good time that allowed me to save the day. I had a good pace, but as I said, in the afternoon the feeling wasn't the same as in the morning.\"\u201cEveryone is very close here today, from the top five down to me in 11th is only 0.1s so there\u2019s nothing between us. One small mistake and you go from P4 to P11 which makes our laps in FP3 really important. We need to get a lap with no mistakes because spending just a tiny amount of time off throttle compared to another rider can see you in Q1 instead of Q2. But it\u2019s been a good day, we were focusing on the race today and preparing for Qualifying so there\u2019s speed to come. I\u2019m happy with how it has gone so far and we\u2019ve had a productive day working for the future.\u201d\u201cIn FP2 I focused on race set-up, I tried hard and medium tyres and I was checking everything ahead of race day. I didn\u2019t do a proper time attack, even if I had some good laps. I feel comfortable so far and my main target now is to get into Q2 tomorrow. I will push in FP3 and see where I can end up. The team and I will analyse which will be the best tyre choice for the race, because at the moment they feel quite similar. But in the end it\u2019s only Friday and we have time to get prepared for Sunday.\u201d\u201cIn the morning it was great and I was feeling quite good on the bike, and also in the afternoon. Today the most important thing for us was to try all the tyre options and also to see which set-up we should try to keep working with. So, we are quite clear on all those things and did a good job, just with the soft tyre at the end of FP2 I wasn\u2019t able to push as I wanted, but despite that I\u2019m happy and it\u2019s a positive day. I feel great on the track, tomorrow I need to polish a lot of things and improve, but I\u2019m feeling great on the bike, enjoying it and the most important thing is we keep working like this.\u201d\u201cSince this morning I got a very good feeling with the front and could brake a lot later. The weakest points for us are always the long straights, but there are plenty of nice corners here, so I really enjoyed riding my bike today. In FP2 I just couldn\u2019t put everything together, but I think if I can manage this tomorrow morning, I might make the jump to Q2. I\u2019m really happy about this, because we are working a lot on the bike and we are gaining a good feeling. We still miss a bit of maximum speed to be really on top, but I\u2019m still satisfied.\u201d\"I'm happy with today. We worked well with the team, but it's a pity I made too many mistakes on my time attack with the new tyre. Aragon is not an easy track and, compared to last year, it was a surprise to see a Ducati so competitive on this track. For tomorrow we will focus on the details, the electronics, the suspension, and then we will try to do a good FP4 to know which tyre to use for the race. For the moment, all three compounds seem to work well.\u201d\u201cIt was definitely not an easy day. I had a huge crash in the third lap of FP1. I felt really good and confident with the bike, but the tyre was too cold, I pushed too much and went down. Then I restarted to work in order to gain my confidence again. I have to say a huge thanks to my guys because they repaired the bike pretty quick to be ready for FP2. We worked hard, I felt good in the second session and I\u2019m not far off the top. We still need to improve for tomorrow\u2019s Qualifying, as I think we can fight for the Q2.\u201d\u201cToday was difficult, which we expected a little bit because this track isn\u2019t the best for the bike, nor for me. For some reason, I have always struggled here at Aragon. We will still give our maximum here and we will try our best to work better with the rear tyre. We will try to modify the settings a little bit to try to be gentler with it. In the end it wasn\u2019t too bad though and we were better in the afternoon. I\u2019m not the fastest but I\u2019m only one second from pole position and that put me 19th. Normally here the grip improves each day and we will also try to be competitive tomorrow.\"\"On this first day, we did what we had set out to do, which was to turn as many laps as possible. Although the sensations were good in any case, there is still the fact that I don\u2019t have that much experience on the RS-GP yet and I need to increase my confidence. We were able to improve consistently, shaving off more than a second between the two sessions, so that is positive. We need to keep working this way. Considering the high level here in MotoGP, it\u2019s the details and especially the rider\u2019s confidence that make all the difference.\"\u201cHere there\u2019s a huge difference between putting on a new tyre or a used one. I decided to do FP2 with the race tyre and not the soft one, because I wanted to understand the true feeling with the bike and to get prepared for the race. This afternoon it looks like I\u2019m really far from the top, but in reality I\u2019m not worried because I wasn\u2019t pushing for a fast lap. Tomorrow the times will come down further and everything will get faster, so it will be interesting to see what we can do. I will be trying the soft tyres for sure, but of course you can\u2019t just put that tyre on and go fast, it\u2019s more important to work on the overall set-up.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really good to experience being in MotoGP for a second time. The speed of the bike wasn\u2019t such a shock this time and it was really enjoyable. I struggled a bit in FP1 just to find my reference points, as it\u2019s obviously different to when I rode here in Moto2. In FP2 we found a good direction with both the bike and me, plus the team are all working great. We stayed with the same medium hard tyres throughout the whole day and I felt really good. When everyone else was on the same tyre as us, we weren\u2019t too far off. Tomorrow we\u2019ll put the soft on to try a time attack and I think we could be quite close to the guys at the front. I really enjoy this track and when you have a good feeling somewhere, you tend to do alright. The overall result doesn\u2019t reflect on what we\u2019ve done today, as we didn\u2019t use a new tyre, and I feel like we can do a really good job tomorrow.\u201dPos| Rider| Bike| Time/Gap  1| J.Miller| DUCATI| 1m47.613  2| A.Espargaro| APRILIA| +0.273  3| C.Crutchlow| YAMAHA| +0.284  4| J.Zarco| DUCATI| +0.375  5| J.Martin| DUCATI| +0.410  6| F.Bagnaia| DUCATI| +0.419  7| F.Quartararo| YAMAHA| +0.421  8| M.Marquez| HONDA| +0.435  9| T.Nakagami| HONDA| +0.444  10| E.Bastianini| DUCATI| +0.473  11| P.Espargaro| HONDA| +0.553  12| A.Rins| SUZUKI| +0.654  13| B.Binder| KTM| +0.665  14| A.Marquez| HONDA| +0.701  15| D.Petrucci| KTM| +0.738  16| L.Marini| DUCATI| +0.843  17| I.Lecuona| KTM| +0.913  18| M.Oliveira| KTM| +1.010  19| V.Rossi| YAMAHA| +1.036  20| M.Vi\u00f1ales| APRILIA| +1.142  21| J.Mir| SUZUKI| +1.273  22| J.Dixon| YAMAHA| +2.374  Pos| Rider| Bike| Nation| Points  1| Fabio QUARTARARO| Yamaha| FRA| 206  2| Joan MIR| Suzuki| SPA| 141  3| Johann ZARCO| Ducati| FRA| 137  4| Francesco BAGNAIA| Ducati| ITA| 136  5| Jack MILLER| Ducati| AUS| 118  6| Brad BINDER| KTM| RSA| 108  7| Maverick VI\u00d1ALES| Yamaha| SPA| 95  8| Miguel OLIVEIRA| KTM| POR| 85  9| Aleix ESPARGARO| Aprilia| SPA| 83  10| Jorge MARTIN| Ducati| SPA| 64  11| Alex RINS| Suzuki| SPA| 64  12| Marc MARQUEZ| Honda| SPA| 59  13| Takaaki NAKAGAMI| Honda| JPN| 58  14| Pol ESPARGARO| Honda| SPA| 52  15| Alex MARQUEZ| Honda| SPA| 49  16| Franco MORBIDELLI| Yamaha| ITA| 40  17| Danilo PETRUCCI| KTM| ITA| 36  18| Enea BASTIANINI| Ducati| ITA| 35  19| Iker LECUONA| KTM| SPA| 33  20| Luca MARINI| Ducati| ITA| 28  21| Valentino ROSSI| Yamaha| ITA| 28  22| Stefan BRADL| Honda| GER| 11  23| Dani PEDROSA| KTM| SPA| 6  24| Lorenzo SAVADORI| Aprilia| ITA| 4  25| Michele PIRRO| Ducati| ITA| 3  26| Tito RABAT| Ducati| SPA| 1  27| Cal CRUTCHLOW| Yamaha| GBR| 0  28| Garrett GERLOFF| Yamaha| USA| 0  29| Jake DIXON| Yamaha| GBR| 0  Moto2 Championship leader Remy Gardner (Red Bull KTM Ajo) ends Day 1 at the Gran Premio TISSOT de Aragon as the fastest man in the intermediate class, but the Spaniard had some seriously close company as Augusto Fernandez (Elf Marc VDS Racing Team) got within just 0.007.

Since setting off some 23 hours and 45 minutes earlier, Nicky had climbed 65 peaks over 2000ft and arrived back at 2.45am, beating the previous fastest time set by Carol Morgan in 2020 (23h57). In that time she had run 130km and 10,600m of ascent in the Cumbrian fells.**__ Sunrise on Blencathra during the attempt(C) Damian HallThe Lake District 24-Hour challenge requires runners to summit as many peaks over 2000ft as possible, and return to the same starting point within a 24-hour period. Peaks must be climbed in the same order as the previous record-holder, with extra summits being added or the same number of summits being reached in less time. Eligible peaks are described by strict criteria and are available on a list from the Bob Graham Club.In many ways, the Lake District 24-Hour record (also known as the 24 Hour Fell Record) is the original Lake District fell running challenge, predating the Bob Graham Round by some 28 years. The latter was in fact born out of a successful attempt on the 24 Fell Record by namesake Bob Graham in 1932. In 1977, Jean Dawes became the first lady to complete Bob Graham's circuit of 42 peaks, setting a first women's time for the 24 Hour Fell Record in the process. In 2011, Nicky became the 6th woman to set a new record on the challenge, reaching 64 peaks on what was now quite a different route from the Bob Graham Round.Anyone who knows Nicky will testify that she knows her own mind and that her determination is never in short supply. She had previously mentioned to me that she thought she could claim back the record, so it was no surprise that she set to this task with 100% conviction until the job was done. But how does she do it? After giving Nicky a few days to recover I caught up with her to find out about her record-breaking attempt and discover what keeps her keeping on\u2026__ Nicky has spent much of the past decade beating records, some of them her own.(C) Dan Bailey - UKHillwalking**Keri: How did the Lake District 24-Hour challenge first catch your interest?****Nicky:** Back in 2010 I was looking for my next big challenge and a friend, Simon Rippon, suggested the Lake District 24 hour record - I was intrigued! After timing a few recce legs on the route, I decided it was doable and so attempted it on a hot day in July 2011, adding two peaks (Fleetwith Pike and Sand Hill) to the existing record. By the last leg I was feeling shocking and so decided not to add my third planned peak, Grisedale Pike. I finished in 23h15, and so in hindsight I felt confident that I could add the third peak. The idea of having another go has been on my mind for ten years but since I was the record holder and had lots of other projects on the go, I never considered it any further.When I heard that Carol Morgan had broken my record in August 2020 by adding Grisedale Pike and finishing in 23.57, that spurred me on! I tried to recce and get fit during various lockdowns and then set the date of May 2021 for my attempt.**Your May 2021 attempt didn't go as planned. How did you feel setting out this time by comparison?**In May it had already been raining hard for a full week and on the day those showers turned to snow during Leg 1. Compounded by the clag, the conditions slowed us down and I got very cold as well. I carried-on into Legs 2 and 3 but was consistently losing time, so I decided to stop on Leg 4 after Wasdale.A week before my successful attempt this month, the weather forecast was also pretty poor but there was at least a glimmer of hope for better weather, so I stuck with the plan. I've been in this situation many times before and it's always worth looking for a weather window. My support knew I would move the attempt forwards or backwards by 24 hours if needed because my chances of success would be less in poorer weather.__ Descending Pike of Stickle(C) Tori Miller, Inov-8**You managed to climb the same number of peaks as Carol Morgan but in less time. Did the attempt go as planned or had you originally hoped to add another peak or two to the previous tally?**From the outset I had warned my support team that if the weather was anything but ideal I wouldn't try and add any more peaks in but would go for beating Carol's time instead. When I arrived on Friday afternoon I made the decision, based on the weather, to drop the two planned extra peaks of Knott and Bowscale and go for a faster time. I felt a lot happier and more confident once that decision was made.It turned out to be the right choice because we had really mixed weather on the attempt; while climbing Skiddaw we were in rain, wind and thick clag and throughout Leg 4 and 6 the cloud-level was up and down.**Talk us through your journey and any memorable high and low points**There were a lot of high points. Jasmin [Paris] and Damian [Hall] were such good company and the sunrise was amazing on Leg 1 (Braithwaite to Threlkeld)! Jasmin has supported me on a few rounds on Leg 1 and she always brings a good sunrise with her!Leg 2 (Threlkeld to Dunmail) went really well and my legs felt so good. I even said to Ben [Abdelnoor] that I was looking forward to climbing Fairfield because I was a bit tired of running fast now. That leg seemed to go so quickly.__ She knows the Lakes well! Nicky on the Threlkeld to Dunmail leg on her 2016 double Bob Graham(C) Dan Bailey - UKHillwalkingOn Leg 3 (Dunmail to Wasdale) I started off feeling a little jaded but I know that the Langdales do that to people and I so tried to jog quickly through them to get to Rossett Pike. Tom Pape took a great line up Rossett and approaching the higher, rocky section I felt really happy. Having recced Broad Stand with Jim Paxman a few weeks before I was confident about it and even though it was a bit slippy I was very comfortable. Heading to Lingmell I was feeling great and really skipping along, as I knew I was in much better shape than I was in May. On the descent to Wasdale, it was a boost to see Joss [Naylor] and Charmian [Heaton] at the stile. I gave Joss a hug and a kiss, and received one back! That made my day as I know Joss only turns out when he thinks someone has put the work-in and will succeed - it's such a vote of confidence! [Fell running hero Joss Naylor broke the Lake District 24 hour Fell Record three times in the 1970s].The low points began during Leg 4 (Wasdale to Honister) - it's such a long leg and my stomach was now refusing food. Rice puddings were going down ok and some gels but we started to lose time on the schedule and that worried me. Climbing Kirkfell was horrid and I started to tip backwards as I was ascending. I knew I had to rectify this lack of energy so had an urgent rice pudding at the top of Red Gully! Great Gable seemed to go on forever in the clag and when I was coming-off I felt lightheaded and so didn't get a great line. I pushed hard across to Grey Knotts and Fleetwith and was pleased that we still had daylight to get to Honister.Honister was another low point, as I had some coffee and tried a packet expedition meal but was then violently sick. Heading up Dale Head at the start of Leg 5 (Honister to Newlands Hause) I felt strong though, but still had 5 to 6 hours to go. Keith [Holmes] and Steve [Sanders] were great and I ate two rice puddings and two gels on this leg. It cheered me up quite a bit that I could at least get these down!At Newlands I decided not to stop before Leg 6 (Newlands Hause to Braithwaite), as I couldn't face being sick again but unfortunately bad traffic had held up some of my crew, so I didn't get any resupplies. That was a real blow at this late stage! I took several gels before getting a really churning sick feeling which slowed me a lot more. I decided to just get on with being sick and then press-on again! After that it was just coke and water - and lots of puffing!**65 peaks is a lot! What are your favourite and worst sections of this long route?**I have never liked Leg 2, being that I'm not a natural fast runner and have to work hard to keep the pace going. On the day though, Leg 2 went well and I was able to eat and move fast at the same time. The weather was also good which always helps!When I'm fit and my legs are feeling good, I enjoy big climbs and rocky sections, so Leg 3 from Rossett Pike onwards is a favourite of mine.When I was climbing Yewbarrow and Red Pike I did wish that all of the round could be uphill after that as my legs were so strong that it felt easy compared to descending or flat running!The last leg was the worse section in reality, as I knew the splits were fast, and after being sick at Honister and not having eaten properly for a few hours, I was losing speed despite trying so hard to maintain it. The rain came down making the rocks very slippy and we were all worried about time seeping away. It was a relief to hit the main track and run into the finish with some time to spare.__ Nicky at the finish - this Braitwaite bench marked the start and end of her round(C) Amanda Heading**Your supporters are  clearly very important to you. How do you choose them, and how did the team around you influence your success?**I find that the best people to surround yourself with are ones that will turn themselves inside out for you. They don't have to be the fastest runners in the main, however I knew on Legs 1 and 2 that I needed quick people as otherwise it can be hard to for them to support well and keep up. Jasmin Paris and Damian Hall ran this section with me. Jasmin navigated which was a relief and the conversation was always great!For my support I choose people that know me well and understand that I'm not a chatty person but here to get a job done! I had a fantastic team of support and this played a huge part in boosting my motivation and keeping me on schedule. Many are good friends that I have known for years and who have seen me through a lot.Many thanks to Neil Talbott, Ben Abdelnoor and Jean Brown on Leg 2, to Tom Pape and Fiona Pascall on Leg 3 (Fiona even managed to stay positive when I threw-up the fruit salad!) Also to Tim Rippon, Jim Paxman and Lewis Ashton on Leg 3. Further thanks to Simon Rippon (the instigator of all this many years ago), as well as Jess and Gwilym Rivett on Leg 4, then Keith Holmes and Steve Sanders on Leg 5. Keith is a wonderful friend and we don't speak many words because we know what each other are thinking and just what needs to be done! And finally a huge thank-you to my anchor support on Leg 6, Kirsty Hewitson and Helen Elmore. I am the last of the three of us to do our big challenge this year. Kirsty set a women's Lakes, Meres and Waters FKT in July and Helen completed a sub-24h Ramsay Round just two weeks ago. We have seen each other through good and bad times, in running and in life. Thank you also to Adam Micklethwaite for leading the way and getting all the lines right. Amanda Headingwas my road support and had supported me on my first Lake District 24 hour round in 2010. I'm slightly scared of her when she is in full support mode which is good, as I do what she tells me! She was very on-the-ball and made sure I was in and out of the road stops quickly but having had everything I needed.It really was a team effort. Thanks to my supporters I knew I was in safe hands throughout and that if time was getting really tight they would tell me so. Kirsty did exactly that on the last peak and I realised that I needed to push more, even though we all knew I was already giving it everything I'd got!**What else do you consider to be key to your success on big rounds such as this?**Often it comes down to eating and self-discipline. Compared to a lot of runners I am good at eating on the go and will always try and get more food down, even if I've just been sick because I know that it's crucial if I'm going to carry on.In my spare time I provide personal training plans for runners aiming for big races or challenges in the mountains. I was really pleased that my training went well and that my training plan had been well calculated. It is over ten years since I last held this record, so it's also a huge boost personally to feel that I can still achieve something of this scale at 54 years of age. I hope it will inspire other runners to keep striving for their personal goals.I'll be racing Tor des Geants next week. I haven't given it much thought until now and I'm really looking forward to it. I've got no injuries - the legs feel good and apart from puffy feet, and I haven't any niggles.  * See Run Forever, our film of Nicky's double Bob Graham Round here:This video is blocked because you have disabled Statistics cookies  Please **enable them** to view the contentUKC Articles and Gear Reviews by Keri Wallace  * On the Ramsay Round with the Black Trail Runners _19 Aug_  * ARTICLE: The Glencoe Classic Rock Challenge _16 Jun_  * INTERVIEW: In pursuit of purity: going solo on the Winter Bob Graham Round _25 Feb_  * Walk Before You Run - winter skills for hill runners _21 Dec, 2020_  * FEATURE: A Celebration of Women in the Hills _8 Mar, 2020_  * No Climbing Experience, No Race \u2013 The Future of Extreme Skyrunning? _9 Sep, 2019_#### Fat Tyres and Quickdraws: Mountain Biking and Sport Climbing in the Peak#### From Intensive Care to Bob Graham Round - the saga of an epic journeyAs climbers we strive to make UKClimbing.com the kind of website we would love to visit, with the most up-to-date news, diverse and interesting articles, comprehensive gear reviews, breathtaking photographs and a vast and useful logbook system.

Learn more# The best strategy games you can play right nowBy  GamesRadar Staff 12 September 2021Whether you're a fan of turn-based tactics or a good RTS, there's something for everyone in the best strategy games  *   *   *   *   *   * __Page 1 of 3:If this best strategy games list proves anything, it's that the strategy genre is full of sub-genres that offer up a variety of different experiences. While some of the best strategy games find a great home on PC, a lot of titles have also landed on consoles too. From long-running series to more recent offerings, there's something for long-time players and newcomers alike to discover in our list of the best strategy games the genre has to offer reflects that.There's always lots to do - from managing civilisations and dealing with politics to planning out battles turn by turn, strategy games deal with both peace and conflict. Whether you're into round-based combat, real-time management, or grand strategy, on this list you'll find only the best strategy games to play right now.(Image credit: Stardock)As the name suggests Offworld Trading Company focuses on the production, refinement and trading of the kind of resources you generally need to keep a colony alive. Where in other games you just harvest what's available, here you need to work the _market_ - discourage competitors, buy surplus cheaply and sell what's in demand expensively. Offworld Trading Company makes you one of the worst forces of capitalism, a stock broker on Mars. If you like juggling numbers and working against the clock in order to make a sale, this is the game for you. In a lot of ways, it's just like leading a large skirmish, only for cold, hard cash to replace swords. When you get to build in OTC, each building acts like a powerful skill in an RPG, giving you new means to beg, borrow and steal. Victory is never sweeping, so if you enjoy meticulous work that isn't represented by piles of bodies on screen, play Offworld Trading Company.(Image credit: Shiro Games)If you've ever played a strategy game, you're probably familiar with the Age of Empires-type RTS that has you build a civilisation from nothing in order to eventually lead it into war. Northgard is this, but with Vikings. Vikings aren't just a replaceable people - Northgard is special because of them. You need to deal with the harsh weather in Scandinavia as well as its dangerous wildlife. Clans have different skills and war chiefs, and thus play differently, but this isn't a game just about war. You're asked to gather fame by making discoveries and helping your clan grow, and you can win just as easily by trading and making your clan indispensable to the Viking economy. Thus, Northgard is both a homage to famous RTS games, and an evolution of their systems. **Available on: PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch**(Image credit: Paradox Interactive)Despite its technical clumsiness, Battletech, based on a popular tabletop game, takes a novel approach to round-based mech combat. It's not enough to simply hit your opponent, instead you have to disable specific limbs, something that due to the game's random number generator is often down to luck. While gameplay can veer between annoying and really exciting that way, what makes Battletech stand out in particular is its story, which isn't only great for a genre that doesn't always put a lot of stock in its narratives. Thanks to a lot of effort put in the general presentation and idea, Battletech is a truly unique game you should definitely give a chance.## 22\\. Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden(Image credit: Funcom)If you like XCOM, there is really no reason you wouldn't like Mutant Year Zero. It's the same brand of round-based tactics, with a dash of post-apocalyptic weirdness in the form of your usual broken-down city environments and\u2026 anthropomorphic animals? Yes, Mutant Year Zero's absolutely unique selling points are its mutated protagonists, who can learn new skills through further mutations, and who drive the interesting story. Add to that a good (and at times absolutely necessary) stealth system and you get a game that successfully combines old and new. It's also a real challenge, mildly unfair at times, but definitely worth a try for all who already know XCOM like the back of their hand. **Available on: PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch**  (Image credit: Snapshot Games)It's not surprising to find  many similarities between XCOM and Phoenix Point once you know the latter has been designed by Julian Gollop, the mind behind the XCOM brand of turn-based tactics. Phoenix Point isn't just another XCOM, however. While the central conflict is one again one between humans and aliens, Phoenix Point refines XCOM's systems by giving you more control over your shots, loadouts and recruits. Sometimes you just get a lot of detailed info without really being able to use it, but it does make systems more understandable and winning feel less like sheer luck. It's an effort to add more systems and gameplay elements to XCOM - not everything works, but it's a great alternative all the same. _Turn to page two for more of the best strategy games..._Current page: Page 1Next Page Page 2GamesRadar+ was first founded in 1999, and since then has been dedicated to delivering video game-related news, reviews, previews, features, and more.

Learn more# Majority of women working at Paradox Interactive report mistreatment in staff surveyBy  Rich Stanton 06 September 2021The recent departure of CEO Ebba Ljungerud is apparently unconnected(Image credit: Paradox Interactive.)Last week Paradox Interactive announced _the departure of CEO Ebba Ljungerud_, who apparently resigned \"due to differing views on the company's strategy going forward.\" She was replaced by former CEO and Paradox co-founder Fredrik Wester, who says he's in it for the long-haul.Today, the Swedish business and tech website _breakit.se_ scored a scoop: a leaked Paradox employee survey from last month conducted by two unions, Unionen and Sveriges Ingenjorer. conducted an employee survey at Paradox Interactive about the company's working environment.Paradox employs around 400 people in Sweden and 133 chose to take part in the survey. Of those, 44 percent claimed to have experienced \"mistreatment\" but the numbers get much worse among female employees. Women made up 26% of the total respondents, and 69% of them said they had received abuse or mistreatment.\"Offensive treatment is a systematic and far too common problem at Paradox,\" says the conclusion of the report, later adding \"There is a perception that perpetrators at managerial level are protected by the company.\"One of the more interesting details in breakit.se's story is that this report was presented to Paradox HR manager Marina Hedman and then-CEO Ebba Ljungerud August 30. Paradox staff were shown the report two days later on Wednesday 1st August, a few hours before Ljungerud's resignation.Paradox for its part denies there's any connection between the report and Ljungerud's exit. Asked about the role of the employee survey in Ljungerud's departure, Fredrik Wester said simply \"none.\"In response to the news, Paradox communication manager Loic Fontaine emailed the following: \"Paradox is now in the process of bringing in an external, neutral company to conduct a thorough review of our processes and a comprehensive employee survey.\"As the news spread, some former Paradox employees shared the thought that this had been a long time coming.> tbh this is a long time coming. I am glad they are addressing it. Hopefully, they will sort it out.September 6, 2021PC Gamer contacted Paradox, who provided the following statement:\"Obviously the results of this survey are deeply concerning. The management team wants to ensure this data is acted upon, but taking immediate, direct action is legally difficult thanks to the informal nature of the survey (which is not to say it's being dismissed out-of-hand by any means).\"As stated to Breakit, we decided last week to have an independent company run an audit of our processes to report and handle cases of discrimination and harassment. We'll also have them run a comprehensive survey to provide us with clearly defined and actionable data that we can use to make impactful change.\"At this point we're in the process of hiring an independent and neutral firm that specializes in this process.\"Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

Upon the conclusion of the survey, the results were derived from 133 participating employees. This is less that half of the 400 employees in Sweden.Of the 133 employees who participated in the survey, 44% noted to having experienced mistreatment. According to a Breakit source,> \"It was thought that the survey would show something considering that the gaming industry is not the nicest place. But not to this extent.\"The report notes this mistreatment is the worst amongst women who were 26% of the employees who responded to the survey. Of these women, 69% of them noted \"abusive treatment.\"Furthermore, the employees overall noted a \"culture of silence\" at Paradox Interactive, publisher of such games as _Europa Universalis IV,Crusader Kings III, Hearts of Iron IV, _and more. Both unions, Unionen and Sveriges Ingenjorer, are demanding changes from the company.Breakit goes on to note shortly after these results were delivered to Paradox leadership, CEO Ebba Ljungerud resigned. However, according to Breakit, Ljungerud's decision to resign was supposedly entirely her own and pertained to the future strategy of Paradox.Kotaku reached out to Paradox for a statement, which is presented in full below:> \"Obviously the results of this survey are deeply concerning. The management team wants to ensure this data is acted upon, but taking immediate, direct action is legally difficult thanks to the informal nature of the survey (which is not to say it's being dismissed out-of-hand by any means).> \"As stated to Breakit, we decided last week to have an independent company run an audit of our processes to report and handle cases of discrimination and harassment. We'll also have them run a comprehensive survey to provide us with clearly defined and actionable data that we can use to make impactful change.> \"At this point we're in the process of hiring an independent and neutral firm that specializes in this process; beyond that I don't have further detail I can offer right now. I appreciate you reaching out.\"A highly opinionated avid PC gamer, Poorna blindly panics with his friends in various multiplayer games, much to the detriment of his team.

Eine Umfrage bei den Mitarbeitern durch die schwedischen Gewerkschaften SACO und Unionen brachte erschreckende Ergebnisse.Demnach beklagt sich rund die H\u00e4lfte der 133 teilnehmenden Mitarbeiter der Umfrage \u00fcber schlechte Behandlung, darunter vor allem Mobbing/Schikane und geschlechtliche Diskriminierung, vor allem bei den Frauen. 69 Prozent der weiblichen Teilnehmer gaben an, dass sie Opfer entsprechender Vorf\u00e4lle wurden. Bei der m\u00e4nnlichen Belegschaft waren es 33 Prozent.Zudem wurde beklagt, dass die T\u00e4ter offenbar durch das Unternehmen gesch\u00fctzt werden und es eine Kultur des Schweigens bei Paradox g\u00e4be. Die Ergebnisse der Umfrage wurden mittlerweile der Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrung und danach der Belegschaft vorgelegt. Ein ung\u00fcnstiger Zeitpunkt f\u00fcr Paradox, da gerade der CEO gewechselt hat (nicht aufgrund der Vorf\u00e4lle, wie das Unternehmen betont und die Gewerkschaften auch best\u00e4tigen).Paradox hat sich gegen\u00fcber den Kollegen von Eurogamer mittlerweile ge\u00e4u\u00dfert und versprochen, umgehend Ma\u00dfnahmen einzuleiten, um die Zust\u00e4nde zu verbessern. Dazu soll auch ein externes, neutrales Unternehmen einbezogen werden, um alles zu evaluieren:_\"We are aware of a survey undertaken inside the company on this topic, and of the results, which are obviously not satisfactory. The management team wants to ensure this data is acted upon, but taking immediate, direct action is legally difficult thanks to the informal nature of the survey (and thanks to the results being shared just before we underwent this CEO change, which has been fairly busy for us). We are currently working to reconcile the informal survey with our own internal research, and are eager to take action. Paradox is now in the process of bringing in an external, neutral firm to conduct a thorough audit of our processes and a comprehensive employee survey. This will help us advance our efforts towards all of the subjects that we've worked to improve in recent years - harassment and abuse will be paramount among these, but we'll also be examining subjects like unbiased hiring and compensation, ongoing bias awareness, inclusion, and more.\"_Von Andreas Philipp  | 07.09.2021 09:46 Uhr __Teilen __Tweet __MailKommentare k\u00f6nnen ohne Einwilligung zu Cookies nicht angezeigt werdenInfos zur Firma## Paradox Interactive20 West 22nd Street, Suite 412 __Themen von A bis Z __Partner und NetzwerkCopyright 2021 by Entertainment Media Group AG.Alle Rechte vorbehalten.Dein Magazin rund um Games..."}

Accountability starts from the top,\" Wester said.Wester said that during the meeting, \"a Paradox employee was subject to inappropriate behavior from me personally,\" but gave no specifics as to how his behavior was inappropriate.However, he said he apologized to the person in question within a week \"in a process reviewed by HR.\"\"It has never been my intention to make anyone uncomfortable around me, but that is still what happened, much to my regret,\" Wester said. \"Following this episode, I have been working with my coach and mentor to understand the impact of my behavior better, and to better myself.\"He denied that the incident led to his stepping down from the CEO position later in February of that year. He was replaced at the time by Ebba Ljungerud, who held the CEO role until her own departure due to \"differing views on company strategy\" earlier this month before the publication of the survey. (Wester was executive chairman of the board during Ljungerud's tenure, but retook the CEO role upon her departure.)\"I understand that this makes my cause less credible when it comes to handling these issues internally and will therefore not be involved directly with it, it will be done by HR at Paradox with external help, but of course with my full support if needed,\" Wester said.Making the games industry a better place to workFind out more__Sign up for The Publishing & Retail newsletter and get the best of GamesIndustry.biz in your inbox.Enter your email address## Apple refuses to reinstate Epic's developer account in South Korea\"We would welcome Epic's return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else,\" Apple saidBy Marie Dealessandri## Wario Ware takes No.1 as seven new games enter the Top 40 | UK Boxed ChartsOverall, sales are low for new physical releasesBy Christopher DringUK PR Executive (Entry Level)Senior UI/UX Designer \u2013 Mobile Games \u2013 Fully remoteJunior / Experienced Programmer __Second Impact GamesDiscover more jobs in games __There are no comments on this article yet.

Well, that's Deathloop. The game takes place in the mysterious Black Reef, in what's described as a \"time of madness\".

From indie developer Shedworks, you play as Sable who sets out on her \"gliding\", which is said to be a rite of passage that will see you travel across expansive deserts. As you venture through the landscape, you can explore it in whatever way you wish at your own pace. From traveling on your hoverbike (yes, you have a hoverbike), to climbing ruins, or walking on foot, you can solve puzzles and encounter other nomads who might just ask for your help.(Image credit: Ubisoft) **Platform(s):** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC  **Release date** : October 7, 2021Yes, that's right. Far Cry is returning once again. Set in Yara, which is described as a \"tropical paradise frozen in time\", Far Cry 6 sees you play as a local Yaran called Dani Rojas. Taking on the role of a guerrilla fighter, you set out to take down the dictatorship regime of  Anton Castillo (played by Giancarlo Esposito). As the leader of Yara, Castillo wants to restore the nation back to its former glory, and he's willing to do it by any means necessary.(Image credit: Nintendo)For the first time in 19 years, we've got a new 2D Metroid game inbound. Metroid Dread will finally end the story that began way back in 1986 and bring the 2D Metroid games to Switch for the first time. It takes some ideas from the 3DS Metroid: Samus Returns release, but also some ideas from the likes of Alien: Isolation. New robotic enemies known as the E.M.M.I, which will hunt Samus down the minute they hear her moving through their patrol zones. Using new abilities like a Phantom Cloak that turns Samus invisible for a little while, you may just be able to evade them. But, basically, prepare to run - a lot.(Image credit: Warner Bros.) **Platform(s):** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC  Left 4 Dead 3 in all but name, Back 4 Blood is the same four-player co-op zombie experience that you'd expect from the Valve series - just without the Valve involvement. We dove into the game's recent alpha and can confirm it has the same frantic energy as the Left 4 Dead games, the humor, distinctive style, and of course, lots and lots of zombies. It's going to be beautiful chaos.(Image credit: EA) **Platform(s):** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC  Battlefield is back and we're going near-future with this one. Battlefield 2042 will offer huge 128-player battles when it launches later this year via its all-out warfare modes Conquest and Breakthrough. There are more to come though, including Hazard Zone, but the real pull is the vast, dynamic maps set across the globe. Each of these will feature ever-changing battle conditions and gameplay challenges, forcing players to constantly adapt to things like sandstorms, rocket launches, and tornadoes.(Image credit: Square Enix) **Platform(s):**  Xbox Series X, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PC  Eidos Montreal is bringing us a brand new Marvel game in the form of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. You'll be playing as Star-Lord, leading the Guardians as they try to save the universe from a problem of their own (accidental) creation. While you play solely as Star-Lord, you'll have to make decisions for the team, and will be able to command them in battle too. Plus, it's all set to a suitably amazing 80s soundtrack.(Image credit: Xbox Game Studios)Age of Empires 4 will let players explore history once more with a campaign set across eight civilizations across history - from Joan of Arc against the English to Genghis Khan and his conquest of Asia. You'll need to build cities, manage your resources, and lead your troops into battle both on land and at sea. There are four distinct campaigns, with 35 missions spanning over 500 years of history from the Dark Ages to the Renaissance.(Image credit: Ubisoft) **Platform(s):** PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC, Stadia  What Ubisoft is hoping will be your new favorite social space is en route, and it's Riders Republic. With up to 50 players active on your map simultaneously, Riders Republic will let you and your friends explore a huge open world created by stitching together iconic US national parks including Yosemite, and Grand Teton. The game features a range of sports to take part in - biking, snowboarding, skiing, and the flying wingsuit - with plenty to get involved with too. Head to the stunt parks, climb mountains, collect objects, or just discover the best scenic spots - there's going to be lots to discover.(Image credit: Activision) **Platform(s):** PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One  **Release date** : November 5, 2021Call of Duty: Vanguard is taking us back to WW2, with its campaign following the stories of four characters based on real fighters - Sgt. Arthur Kingsley, of Britain's 9th Parachute Battalion; Captain Wade Jackson, of the US's Scouting Squadron Six; Second Lieutenant Lucas Riggs, of Australia's 20th Battalion; and Lt. Polina Petrova, of the Soviet 138th Rifle Division. It looks set to explore the horrors of war from the perspective of some of the untold stories of that time, and is probably one of the best looking new-gen games yet.(Image credit: Frontier Developments) **Platform(s):** PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One **  Release date:** November 9, 2021Jurassic World Evolution 2 is bringing back more dinosaur park simulation action, but this time we're going bigger - and deeper - than before. There'll be a new campaign to play through, more dinosaur breeds, new biome options for your enclosures, and enhanced customisation options too. The new Chaos Theory feature will also allow you to replay key moments of your favorite Jurassic Park / Jurassic World films but with a twist, allowing for some spectacular 'what if' moments.(Image credit: Playground Games) **Platform(s):** Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC  The Forza Festival is back, but this time we're going to Mexico! That's right, Forza Horizon 5 is taking us to South America later this year, offering up one of the most beautiful Xbox Series X graphical showcases yet. Developer Playground Games is promising that this is its biggest, most fun, and most diverse title in the series, with the Mexican setting offering a vast range of different biomes to explore. Plus, expect area-specific weather systems, more character creation options, and of course, more cars.(Image credit: Techland)No calendar is complete without a zombie game or two on the horizon, and Dying Light 2 has a good chance of being the only zombie game you'll need for the foreseeable future. Techland got off to fantastic start with the original Dying Light in 2015, and its sequel intends to healthily expand those parameters in every regard. With its reactive world, branching narrative, finessed combat, and radically upgraded visuals, Dying Light 2 is everything you could hope for in one, beautifully apocalyptic package, and then some. There's no release information as of yet, but our barbed wire baseball bats are already prepared and eager for zombie blood.(Image credit: Microsoft Xbox) **Platform(s)** : PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X  **Release date** : December 8, 2021Bearing a curious new sub-header and running on a brand new game engine known as Slipspace, the first Halo Infinite trailer almost seems to suggest that Master Chief's next adventure will have MMO qualities to it, or at least be more open-ended and sandbox-like in flavour. That instantly familiar shot of his armour also teases a potential technological downgrade for everyone's favourite Spartan, though plot details remain threadbare for now. MMO or otherwise, Halo: Infinite could just be the Halo comeback we've all been waiting for.(Image credit: Sony)Solar Ash is the latest game from Hyper Light Drifter and will see players journey through a rift in space known as the Ultravoid, which just happens to be swallowing entire worlds. The game is quite the personal experience, where the characters must find solace in each other as they look to evolve their struggle into something a little more hopeful.(Image credit: Deep Silver) **Platform(s):** Xbox Series X, Xbox One  Name me one other game where you play as a sentient spaceship. Go on, try. Well, welcome Chorus, a brand new space-flight combat shooter, where you play as Nara and Forsaken, her sentient starfighter. Taking the genre straight into the next-generation of consoles, Chorus looks pretty awesome, melding exploration across the universe with outgunning your enemies in an epic quest to free an oppressed galaxy.(Image credit: FromSoftware) **Platform(s)** : PS4, Xbox One, PC, PS5, Xbox Series X  **Release date** : January 21, 2022Originally announced during E3 2019, _Elden Ring_ is the next FromSoftware offering from Dark Souls creator Hidetaka Miyazaka and Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin. In what will be FromSoftware's biggest game to date, Elden Ring takes place in an open world filled with rich lore and a bloody history. Much of the story of the upcoming dark fantasy action RPG remains a mystery, but from an _Xbox Wire_ interview with Miyazaka last year, we do know that the Elden Ring \"is the name given to a mysterious concept that defines the world itself,\" and it has been shattered. The consequences of this will be one of the important themes of the game. Steeped in mystery, Elden Ring looks full of promise.(Image credit: The Pokemon Company)The first open-world Pokemon game ever, Pokemon Legends: Arceus has undoubtedly caused quite the commotion in the fandom. Set long before any of the series entries to date, you'll be exploring Sinnoh in a unique adventure to create the region's first Pokedex. Catching Pokemon will be as simple as throwing a Pokeball at them whilst creeping towards them out in the open, which will seamlessly enter you into a battle. It's the Pokemon game we've all been dreaming of.(Image credit: Ubisoft) **Platform(s):** PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PC, Google Stadia, Amazon Luna  Formerly known as Rainbow Six Quarantine, we're now looking at Rainbow Six Extraction - the name changed for very good reasons of course. This is a spin-off from Rainbow Six Siege, offering similar co-operative multiplayer action where you must work with your squad to combat and defeat a type of parasite-esque alien called the Archaeans.(Image credit: Sloclap)Sifu is the brand new game from Sloclap, the developer that gave us Absolver. In this though, you play as a young Kung-Fu student looking for vengeance after the murder of his family. The game is focused on a unique aging mechanic, where if you make a mistake you can trade off your life to try again, and learn from your errors. But, get too old and you will die, forcing you to start over again.  (Image credit: Volition) **Platfom(s):**  PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PC  Saints Row is coming back with a complete reboot of the series. You'll be building the Sains from the ground up, playing as the Boss with a small group of friends just starting out. It'll be your decisions that will shape the newly formed gang, and you'll be able to make your mark on the fictional city of Santo Ileso by deciding what kind of crime lord you want to be. Drug smuggling? Arms running? You decide. This is the Saints' origin story, and you get to tell it your way.(Image credit: Guerrilla Games)Aloy is officially back in a sequel to 2017's Horizon Zero Dawn, and this time we'll be journeying to the post-apocalyptic setting of San Franciso in America. The trailer which debuted during Sony's Future of Gaming event revealed Horizon Forbidden West will be coming to the PS5, and showed off gorgeous, vibrant landscapes, new big machines creatures, and - most interestingly of all - underwater sequences. We'll no doubt have more mysteries to unravel as we return to Guerrilla Games' unique world when it does eventually release on the next-gen console.(Image credit: Marvel) **Platform(s):** PS5, Xbox Series X, PS4, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch **  Release date:** March 2022Firaxis, the developer behind the XCOM series, is bringing us Marvel's Midnight Suns - a supernatural strategy game featuring 12 iconic Marvel heroes. These Midnight Suns characters are banding together to take on Lillith, the Mother of Demons. But, they'll also need help from The Hunter - aka you, the first-ever customizable Marvel hero.(Image credit: GSC Game World)In this one, you'll be exploring the vast Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in the highly anticipated sequel to the original title. The Zone is a much tougher place to survive than before, especially after the second explosion hit the nuclear reactor. There are violent mutants, deadly anomalies, and warring factions all to contend with - and an incredible power at the center of the Zone that may provide an even more serious threat.(Image credit: Bethesda)Arkane Austin is making a brand new open-world, co-op shooter called Redfall. Set in the island town of Redfall, Massachusetts, the place is under siege by vampires who have blocked out the sun and complete access to the island. You're trapped with a handful of other survivors, who must team up and use innovative weaponry to try to become the ultimate vampire slayers. Think UV blasters and stake guns and you're getting there.  (Image credit: Bethesda)Bethesda's first new IP in 25 years, Starfield, is so wrapped up in mystique and profundity right now, that we're not even sure if it'll be releasing on this generation of console hardware. Here's what we do know: it's set an open world RPG set in space, and Bethesda has been working on it for  _years_. Sorry, but that's about it for now, but at least the studio was kind enough to confirm its existence after so many whispers amongst the industry. Given Bethesda's pedigree, Starfield is now one of the most promising titles of the future, and I can't wait to play it, even if it might not launch until we get our hands on next-gen consoles.(Image credit: Gearbox) **Platform(s):** PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PC  Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is a fantasy-inspired Borderlands spin-off, focusing on the titular Borderlands character Tiny Tina (voiced by Ashly Burch). The game will be a story-driven co-op campaign for up to four players, but unlike other Borderlands titles will be a high-fantasy setting full of monsters, treasures, and even a Dragon Lord. Tiny Tina makes the rules in this world though, like some kind of Dungeon Master, so expect things to go brilliantly awry on the regular.(Image credit: Night School Studio)The 2016 breakout indie hit Oxenfree is getting a sequel in the form of Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals. Developer Night School Studio is delivering us another supernatural mystery to unravel as heroine Riley returns to her hometown of Camena, but discovers a little more than she expected. Other than Riley though, expect a whole new cast of characters, as the developer says it's a new story that also offers an entry point into the games without having played the first entry. Although, you totally should play it!(Image credit: Bethesda)As people start evaporating from the neon-lit streets of Toyko, it's clear that something's not quite right. In Ghostwire: Tokyo strange shadowy figures begin patrolling the streets, and terrifying monsters based on Japanese lore and legends. It's being made by the same studio that brought you survival horror The Evil Within, which is promising. Especially as it sounds like it's filled with paranormal entities, supernatural events, conspiracies, and the occult.(Image credit: Warner Brother Games) **Platform(s):** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC  WB Games Montreal is working on a brand new Batman game, but there's a catch - Batman's been killed. The Gotham Knights are taking over the protection of what the studio is calling the \"most dynamic and interactive Gotham City yet\", with unique abilities and skill trees available for each of the four Knights - Red Hood, Nightwing, Robin, and Batgirl. It's a drop-in, drop-out co-op affair, with an open-world action-adventure gameplay style. Expect to see plenty of DC villains try to take control of Gotham in Batman's absence, meaning the Gotham Knights have definitely got their hands full. But, with combat looking very Batman: Arkham-esque, you'll have plenty of tricks up your batsleeves.(Image credit: Sony)Ever wanted a game where you play as a little street cat? Well, now's your chance. This is Stray, and as the title suggests, you play as a stray kitty exploring a cyberpunk world filled with robots. Because of your stature, you'll be able to sneak under cars, clamber over rooftops, and even be a little bit sneaky. Your task is to untangle an ancient mystery to escape this long-forgotten city, enlisting the help of a small drone, known only as B12.(Image credit: Bandai Namco) **Platform(s):** PS5, Xbox Series X, PC  Park Beyond is a brand new theme park sim coming to new-gen and PC, and it's being made by Limbic Entertainment - the team behind Tropico 6. It might not be trying to reinvent the genre wheel, but it is doing something a little different. Introducing the word \"Impossification\" as the theme for the campaign and the features at large, you'll be playing as a visionary brought in to breathe life into an ageing theme park. Classic rides are getting improvements that take them beyond reality, beyond gravity's pull, and beyond current imagination - hence the word impossification. It's silly, but it just might be brilliant.(Image credit: Annapurna Interactive) **Platform(s):** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC  Get ready for a road trip with Tess Devine and her mother Opal as they set out to uncover their family secrets. After discovering notes and letters tucked away in the attic of their home, the mother-daughter duo journeys to visit old abandoned family properties to learn more about their family history. Revisiting memories that each property holds, Open Roads explores the relationship between Tess and Opal and takes them on \"a journey into the past they'll never forget\". From Gone Home and Tacoma developer Fullbright, this notable upcoming adventure features the voice acting talents of Keri Russel and Kaitlyn Dever.  (Image credit: Daedelic Entertainment)Prepare yourself to become precious with Lord of the Rings: Gollum, a brand new game from Daedalic Entertainment where you play as, unsurprisingly, Gollum. Starting out in Barad-dur, the Mordor fortress where Gollum is being held captive, the game will take you through plenty of Middle-Earth's locations with promises of \"giant, persistent environments, each harbouring several questlines and a range of friendly or unfriendly faces\" - according to the developer in an interview with Edge magazine anyway. Aesthetically the game is inspired by Tolkien's own drawings and plays out like a stealth-action-adventure game that takes advantage of Gollum's dual personalities too.(Image credit: Monomi Park)Monomi Park's adorable ranching sim is back with a sequel simply titled Slime Rancher 2. You'll be back playing as Beatrix LeBeau, but she's off to a new and rather mysterious rainbow-hued island - called Rainbow Island - where there are new slimes to discover beyond those of the Far Far Range. There are new slimes to discover - cotton slime, angler slime, batty slime, and flutter slime among those revealed so far - all of which you can use to fill your new conservatory farm.(Image credit: Nintendo)Splatoon 3 will take players away from Inkopolis to a new region known as the Splatlands. At its heart, the city of Splatsville is home to battle-savvy inklings that you'll be able to cross ink with. The latest series' entry will bring with it a new bow wepaon, increased customisation options, and new movement abilities to the usual 4v4 multiplayer matches.(Image credit: Focus Home Interactive) **Platform(s):** PS5, Xbox Series X, PC, Nintendo Switch **  Release date:** TBC 2022A Plague Tale: Requiem is the surprise sequel to the original A Plague Tale: Innocence that released in 2019. You'll be following the same two heroes, Amicia and her younger brother Hugo, who will have to do whatever it takes to survive in the game's brutal world. Rats will still be a huge problem, but there is more here than just a literal sea of rats to be worried about.## Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope(Image credit: Ubisoft)Ubisoft and Nintendo's brilliant tactical crossover is back for a second installment. Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope will see our heroes embarking on a galactic adventure trying to stop a new villain called Cursa, who wants to absorb the world's energy. They've got more help this time around, with new faces like Rabbid Rosalina and the titular Sparks (hybrids of Super Mario Galaxy's Luma and the Rabbids) to assist. The game is also offering players more freedom, both in exploration by opening up the overworld to offer more secrets, free traversal and more, and in combat by doing away with the grid system in favor of free control within areas of attack.(Image credit: Striking Distance) **Platform(s)** : PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S  Fans of survival horror may want to have The Callisto Protocol on their internal motion sensor. Debuting from new studio Striking Distance, the next-gen survival horror game takes place within a maximum security prison on Jupiter's moon, and promises plenty of gruesome alien nightmare fuel. Devised from Glen Schofield, the man we have to thank for Dead Space, The Callisto Protocol also technically takes place in the PUBG universe - yes, _that_ PUBG universe. See, _now_ you're interested.(Image credit: Warner Bros. ) **Platform(s):** PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S  While not a direct adaptation of the Harry Potter books, Hogwarts Legacy is taking all of its inspo straight from the lore. You'll be playing as a student attending Hogwarts during the 1800s, some hundreds of years before Harry and co were born, but no doubt will get up to plenty of wizardy mischief. It's an open world RPG, so expect plenty to explore too.(Image credit: Studio Wildcard) **Platform(s)** : PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S  The dinosaur hunting PC hit is back with a bigger, ballsier sequel that features none other than Vin Diesel both in front and behind of the digital camera. Yep, the Fast & Furious star is not only playing a key character in the next-gen survival game, but he's joined series developer Studio Wildcard as an executive producer, having long been a fan of the original game. Goodness knows what that means for the final product\u2026 perhaps the dinosaurs were part of our family all along?  (Image credit: Ubisoft) **Platform(s):** PS5, Xbox Series X, PC, Stadia, Luna  The long-awaited Avatar game - now officially called Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - finally got revealed at E3 2021, and it's in development at Massive Entertainment (in collaboration with Lightstorm Entertainment and Disney). The game will be a new standalone story where you plas as a Na'vi and journey across the Western Frontier, which is a brand new part of Pandora not seen in any media before. This is a first-person, action-adventure title, with a living and reactive world that's fighting against the formidable RDA forces.## Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League(Image credit: Warner Bros.) **Platform(s):** PS5, Xbox Series X, PC  Set to arrive sometime in 2022, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League sees you playing as our squad of chaotic semi-heroes. Squad up as Harley Quinn, King Shark, Deadshot, or Captain Boomerang, with bots or other players taking the role of the other four as you play. Set in the Batman: Arkham universe, Rocksteady has already said this is a continuation of the previous games, so prepare to see some existing threads and storylines come to fruition.(Image credit: Scavengers)From sunset skies to the grassy fields, what we've seen of Season so far in the official trailer looks absolutely gorgeous. Following a young woman who leaves a secluded community to explore the world for the first time, you go on a road trip on your bicycle, drawing, photographing, documenting, and recording the life around you. Set to immersive you in a variety of different societies in its \"surreal version of the mid-twentieth century, where thousands of years have passed without any progress,\" Season's atmospheric setting and focus on exploration adds to its appeal.(Image credit: Obsidian Entertainment)Revealed with a cheeky piss-take out of most game trailers, The Outer Worlds 2 is coming. While info on the game is scarce for now, developer Obsidian says the title will deliver a \"new solar system, new crew, same outer worlds\".(Image credit: Microsoft)Forza developer Playground Games is making a hard pivot into RPG territory with the next iteration of Xbox's Fable series, which hasn't seen a mainline entry since 2010's Fable 3. Developed exclusively for Xbox Series X and S, Fable 4 will utilise the enhanced power of the next-generation hardware for a more magical escape into the fantasy of Albion. Just\u2026 don't expect to be speeding around its medieval towns in a Bugatti 64.(Image credit: BioWare)The next major project from BioWare after the disastrous Anthem, Dragon Age 4 will continue the story left off by 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition, positioning former companion Solas as the upcoming RPG's central antagonist. We know little else about the game beyond this, but you can expect plenty of tactical combat, NPC chatter, and - yes - dragon hunting. Hopefully the early months of 2021 will provide more details about when Dragon Age 4 is anticipated to drop.(Image credit: BioWare)In addition to Dragon Age 4, BioWare has also confirmed its returning to the final frontier with a new entry in its long-running Mass Effect series. A brief teaser trailer released at the end of 2020 was all that was needed to get us excited, showing the return of a fan favourite character in Liara, who appears older and wiser than the last time we saw her, and is seemingly on the hunt for Commander Shephard's ship, the Normandy. What could it all mean? BioWare's staying quiet for now, but we're already preparing for launch.  (Image credit: The Initiative)We've long wondered what Microsoft's newly established first-party The Initiative has been up to for the last few years - turns out the answer was more exciting than any of us could have expected. Resurrecting Rare's cult classic franchise for the next-generation, Perfect Dark could be the next killer exclusive for Microsoft's Xbox family, though we're yet to see anything beyond the intriguing cinematic which debuted in 2020. Here's hoping the studio doesn't remain in the dark for much longer.Sidebar is back with another RPG about sports... but that's not all it's about. Just like Golf Story, Sports Story lets you get up to a variety of different shenanigans as well as a healthy dose of sports. You can explore dungeons, go fishing, and much more besides. Instead of just playing golf though, you can play all sorts of different sports such as tennis, hockey, football, and baseball. With lots of fun sporty antics and adventuring to be had, Sports Story looks like another entertaining pixelated delight.(Image credit: Ubisoft)Sea of Thieves isn't the only open-world pirate game out there - Ubisoft's Skull and Bones is also setting sail, with a much more realistic take on pirate battles on the high seas. Skull and Bones is basically Assassin's Creed: Black Flag without the Assassins, as it's being developed by much of the same team behind Black Flag, and promises a sweeping solo campaign as you vie for control over the 18th-century waters in the Indian Ocean. But the real focus looks to be player-versus-player ship skirmishes online, where each player controls their very own warship in team-based fleet battles. There will also be supernatural elements amidst all the cannon-fire, like the colossal tentacles of a terrifying kraken lurking in the deep.(Image credit: Rare)Everwild is a new IP from Rare exclusively for Xbox One that has already caught our attention thanks to its wonderful art style and enchanting world. We really don't know much about this new adventure yet, but the mystery surrounding it just makes it all the more tantalising. Set in a \"natural and magical world,\" Everwild promises to take us on an unforgettable experience. From the trailer that debuted at X019, it's certainly shaping up to be one to keep an eye on. We can hardly wait to find out more about Everwild's world and the many creatures that appear to inhabit it.(Image credit: Neostream Interactive) **Platforms:** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, PC  After starting life as a Kickstarter project, Little Devil Inside actually appeared in the big PS5 showcase in 2020. This is an RPG with survival elements involved, and quite the little sense of humour. It's set in a Victorian-esque era, where you're tasked with discovering - and fighting - a range of bizarre monsters. It looks like quite the romp.(Image credit: Team Cherry)Release date:** TBCTeam Cherry is bringing us another Hollow Knight adventure with Silksong. This time we follow the journey of Princess Hornet - protector of the Hollownest - who's been captured and taken to a strange and distant world. With over 150 new foes and new moves to master, you'll get to explore new towns, complete quests, and try out new tools in this unfamiliar kingdom. The interconnected world Team Cherry has brought to life in its beautiful hand-crafted 2D style is filled with a variety of different vistas that all look absolutely gorgeous, and with so many new features and foes to encounter, Silksong is one jam-packed sequel to watch out for.(Image credit: Bethesda)Announced with a teenie teaser trailer, there's a new Indiana Jones game inbound from MachineGames, Bethesda, and Lucasfilm Games. From the clues hidden in the trailer, it looks like we're looking at an Indy story set in 1937, with our whip-touting hero exploring the standing stones and stone circles of Italy. That date puts it after Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Temple of Doom, and yet before The Last Crusade, which is interesting too. From the hints, it may even be that we're looking at the story involving a lost race of giant cyclops too.(Image credit: Ubisoft)Lucasfilm Games has announced that is working with Ubisoft's Massive Entertainment on an open-world Star Wars game. Now, apart from that, details are quite scarce - beyond that it'll run on Massive's own Snowdrop engine. We imagine it'll take plenty of DNA from Massive's The Division titles, so expect a game focused on photorealism with an action-adventure focus and added RPG elements when it does arrive. It's clearly in very stages of development though, so don't hold your breath for more info on this one any time soon.(Image credit: Avalanche Studios)Contraband is a brand new co-op game coming from Avalanche Studios - the team behind Just Cause. It's set in the fictional world of 1970s Bayan, and will be quite the smuggler's paradise. Not much is known about the game yet, but the studio says it is \"pushing the boundaries with the next generation of [its] Apex Engine\" for the title.(Image credit: PlatinumGames)Thank you Nintendo: first you made Bayonetta 2 possible by bankrolling a Wii U sequel, and now you're giving Platinum fans more of their favourite bullet-blasting witch with Bayonetta 3 on the Switch (in addition to Switch ports of the first two games). All we have to go on so far is a brief cinematic teaser, but its implications are dire: Bayonetta is caught in a losing battle under a blood moon, deprived of her guns (and quite possibly her entire legs) by a mysterious enemy bathed in purple flames. Looks like your precision third-person action combat skills are about to be tested like never before.(Image credit: Io Interactive) **Platform(s):** PS5, Xbox Series X, PC  In the works at IO Interactive, Project 007 (working title) is a James Bond origin story that's set to descend on consoles and PC at some point in the future. The game will feature an entirely original James Bond story, but not much is known about exactly what that will be yet. According to MGM's Robert Marick, IO was chosen because of their position as \"masters of crafting living, breathing worlds of immersive storytelling\".(Image credit: Ninja Theory)Release Date:** TBCThe surprise reveal of the Xbox Series X at The Game Awards also came with this first look at a sequel to the affecting Hellblade. While the trailer doesn't give too much away (apart from the fact it's all in-engine) about what this sequel will entail, don't expect Senua's story to have got any lighter since we last saw her. The disconcerting chanting, flashes of foreboding bonfires, and a man seemingly buried in a rock hint at another harrowing journey that will hopefully make as much of an impact as the original.(Image credit: EA) **Platform(s):**  PS5, Xbox Series X, PC  Motive Studios at EA has revealed that it has been beavering away on a remake of the original Dead Space - one of the best horror games of all time. This version has been \"rebuilt\" from the source material, but removes loading screens, keeps it micro-transaction free, and may well even add in some additional content that was cut from the original. Arriving on new-gen consoles and PC exclusively, this will no doubt be the best version of the game yet.(Image credit: Nintendo)You know a series is popular when a teaser showing literally nothing besides a numbered logo can garner 2 million views on YouTube. At E3 2017, Nintendo dropped a bombshell by confirming the existence of Metroid Prime 4 \\- only to later announce that Metroid Prime 4 has been delayed and rebooted as Nintendo passes it to original trilogy dev Retro Studios. It could be a while before we see this one, but it'll hopefully be worth the extra wait.(Image credit: Blizzard)Officially confirmed at BlizzCon 2019, _Diablo 4_ is set to take us to hell and back with what looks like a devilishly good sequel filled with dungeon crawling goodness. Set in the world of Sanctuary, you'll battle against The Burning Hells in an always online experience that will enable you to fight alongside other adventurers. So far we know of three classes you'll be able to choose from including Druid, Sorceress, and Barbarian. Oh, and remember Lilith from Diablo 2? Well, she's returning in the fourth instalment and from the sounds of it, she'll be causing some trouble for us as one of the game's main antagonists. Her return \"ushers in an age of darkness of misery,\" so you better prepare yourselves.(Image credit: Ubisoft)At long last, Michel Ancel and his team at Ubisoft have confirmed one of the most asked-for, anticipated sequels of our time. Beyond Good and Evil 2 is actually a prequel to Jade and Pey'j's journalistic escapades in the original game, taking on a much grander scale in a cyberpunk, Luc Besson-looking future full of high-tech ships and anthropomorphic animals. The lively crew of space pirates in BG&E2's cinematic reveal trailer are just some of many - you'll be starting from scratch with the hopes of one day reaching their level of professional thievery, visiting (and stealing from) the residents of multiple cities on myriad planets.  (Image credit: Bethesda)After years of prevaricating, party pooping, and a preposterous number of Skyrim re-releases, Bethesda came out at E3 2018 to finally confirm that The Elder Scrolls 6 is officially on the way, even releasing a short but exciting teaser trailer to prove it. That trailer in question doesn't reveal a whole lot, but suggests a number of potential settings for the long awaited sequel, from the long forgotten High Rock to the lost island of Yokuda. Sadly, this RPG is likely to stay in production for quite some time, but the more hopeful adventurers wouldn't be completely mad for expecting The Elder Scrolls 6 to release before the end of the decade. Fingers crossed.(Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment)Blizzard revealed that its cast of heroes would be returning in a new sequel during BlizzCon 2019. Yes, _Overwatch 2_ is happening, and this time it'll change up the game with more of a focus on the storytelling and lore of the Overwatch universe thanks to the addition of Story Missions. In these missions, players will be pitted against AI foes rather than other players. The sequel also includes Hero Missions, which was described as a \"deeply replayable co-op experience\" by Overwatch 2's assistant game director _Aaron Keller_. Set in a variety of locations all over the world, Hero Missions will let players level up heroes and use different elements to modify abilities and power levels. With new characters and lots of additional content, it's already shaping up to be quite an exciting sequel.(Image credit: Owlcat Games)Expect the second game set in the Pathfinder universe to lovingly honor the tabletop game upon which it's based, in the way that only developer OwlCat can. After the massive success of 2018's Pathfinder: Kingmaker, the team is bringing us a brand new story set in the beloved universe: enter a part of the world that was captured by demons nearly a hundred years ago, choose from more classes, cast more spells, and enjoy more verticality in the maps. Chris Avellone rejoins Kingmaker's Creative Director Alexander Mishulin and Lead Writer Alexander Komzolov for the sequel, so expect richly dense characters, fleshed-out dialogue options, and some serious consequences for your in-game choices. Plus, Owlcat has listened to fan feedback, so the game will be about 40 hours shorter than the behemoth that was Kingmaker. We got a chance to preview the game, and we're certain it'll delight Kingmaker and anyone partial to a tabletop-inspired video game world.(Image credit: FYQD) **Platform(s)** : PC, Xbox Series X  Take the parkour of Mirror's Edge but add a sprinkling of samurais, swords and big ass guns, and you have Bright Memory: Infinite - a fast-action game with touches of FPS, where getting dazzling combos is the ultimate aim.

It might sound surprising for a studio that's been around so long, but this marks Ubisoft's first full-fledged remake, distinct from other titles they've simply remastered for newer hardware. That said, The Sands of Time remake is pretty darn faithful to the original, just with modern graphics and gameplay.## Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2(Image credit: Paradox Interactive) **Platform(s)** : PC, Xbox One, PS4  After the release of the first Vampire Masquerade: Bloodlines in 2004, nothing came as close to a great vampire RPG since. Thankfully, Hardsuit Labs and Paradox Interactive are bringing bloodlines back with a sequel that promises to take us on an immersive role-playing experience as a vampire thrown into the world of bloodsuckers in Seattle. As a newly sired vampire, you'll find yourself caught up in Blood trade war between competing vampire factions. With dialogue options, alliances to be made, and choices to make, Bloodlines 2 looks like it's shaping up to fill the void the first game left behind it. _Take a look back at the year with our pick of the_ _best games of 2020_ _.  _GamesRadar+ was first founded in 1999, and since then has been dedicated to delivering video game-related news, reviews, previews, features, and more.

It has never been my intention to make anyone uncomfortable around me, but that is still what happened, much to my regret. Following this episode, I have been working with my coach and mentor to understand the impact of my behavior better, and to better myself.\"The apology comes less than two weeks after the resignation of Paradox's previous CEO, Ebba Ljungerud, and one week after the leak of an internal survey at the studio which found that a majority of the female employees had experienced some form of abusive mistreatment.> In the wake of the recently leaked survey to the press, there have been rumors and discussions about my role in this environment, citing a specific incident in 2018. In the name of transparency and clarity, I would like to shed light on this. Accountability starts from the top.September 13, 2021Wester was president and CEO of Paradox Interactive from 2009 to 2018, when he stepped down from both roles and became executive chairman of Paradox's board of directors--a decision he said was unrelated to the incident in question. He was replaced by Ebba Ljungerud, who unexpectedly resigned from the company on September 1 over what Paradox said were \"differing views on the company's strategy going forward.\"Wester said at the time that Ljungerud's resignation was not connected to the leaked survey, which concluded that \"offensive treatment is a systematic and far too common problem at Paradox,\" and that \"there is a perception that perpetrators at managerial level are protected by the company.\"Despite that, the timing of recent events is bound to raise questions, and having to apologize for a past workplace incident less than two weeks after being reappointed to the top job--and just one week after a report about widespread mistreatment of employees at Paradox became public knowledge--is not a great place to start. Wester acknowledged that fact and said that because of it, he would not be directly involved with handling HR issues.\"I understand that this makes my cause less credible when it comes to handling these issues internally and will therefore not be involved directly with it, it will be done by HR at Paradox with external help, but of course with my full support if needed,\" he said.From that message it's unclear what exactly Wester is recusing himself from--wider employee-related matters, or further resolution of the 2018 incident itself.

(Facebook)A leaked employee survey at Swedish developer Paradox Interactive has revealed an alleged culture of discrimination against women.According to Swedish tech and business website _Breakit_ (via _GamesIndustry.biz_ _)_ , the survey was conducted by two Swedish unions \u2013 Unionen and Sveriges Ingenj\u00f6rer \u2013 back in August.There were 133 employees who took part in the survey, of which 44 per cent claim to have experienced \u201cmistreatment\u201d.Female employees make up 26 per cent of respondents, and 69 per cent of them said they have experienced abusive treatment.Paradox Interactive is best known for its strategy games such as _Crusader Kings_ and _Cities: Skylines_.The survey also alleged a \u201cculture of silence\u201d at the developer, with almost no employees feeling their experience had been treated appropriately.\"Offensive treatment is a systematic and far too common problem at Paradox,\" it concludes.Paradox will conduct their own survey in response to the union report, and is \"now in the process of bringing in an external, neutral company to conduct a thorough review of our process and a comprehensive employee survey,\u201d according to an internal email.In addition, CEO Ebba Ljungerud recently resigned from the company \"due to differing views on the company's strategy going forward.\"She has been replaced by former CEO and Paradox co-founder Fredrik Wester, who claimed there was no link between her departure and the union report.Stars you didn't know are LGBT+Celebs you didn't know have an LGBT siblingThe stars who went gay for payParadox responded to _PC Gamer_ with a statement:\"Obviously the results of this survey are deeply concerning. The management team wants to ensure this data is acted upon, but taking immediate, direct action is legally difficult thanks to the informal nature of the survey (which is not to say it's being dismissed out-of-hand by any means).\"As stated to Breakit, we decided last week to have an independent company run an audit of our processes to report and handle cases of discrimination and harassment. We\u2019ll also have them run a comprehensive survey to provide us with clearly defined and actionable data that we can use to make impactful change.\"At this point we're in the process of hiring an independent and neutral firm that specializes in this process.\"Paradox is just the latest game developer accused of discriminatory behaviour, following the likes of Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft and Fullbright._For more gaming news, follow Gaymeo onFacebook and Twitter.

Read our editorial policy.#  Paradox CEO admits \"inappropriate behaviour\" towards employee in 2018Following a survey reporting widespread mistreatment at the companyNews  by Alice O'Connor News EditorPublished on  13 Sep, 2021Fredrik Wester, the CEO of Paradox Interactive, has publicly expressed regret for \"inappropriate behaviour\" towards an employee at a company event in 2018. This comes shortly after someone leaked the results of a union survey which revealed many employees felt they'd been mistreated at the company behind games including Crusader Kings and Hearts Of Iron. \"Accountability starts from the top,\" said Wester.\"In the wake of the recently leaked survey to the press, there have been rumors and discussions about my role in this environment, citing a specific incident in 2018,\" begins Wester's Twitter thread today. He says that at a company-wide conference in 2018, \"a Paradox employee was subject to inappropriate behavior from me personally\".Wester says he apologised for his behaviour the following Monday \"in a process reviewed by HR\". He does not say if he suffered any professional consequences, only that he began working with his coach and mentor \"to understand the impact of my behavior better, and to better myself.\"Wester was CEO of Paradox for 15 years before ascending to the board in 2018. He became CEO again earlier this month after his replacement, Ebba Ljungeru quit--in Paradox's words--\"due to differing views on the company's strategy going forward\". Wester says that \"contrary to what people may suggest\", his move was unconnected to his behaviour towards the employee, and that the change had been planned for months by then.The survey leaked to press earlier this month was held by the company's unions. Almost half of respondees (an incomplete picture of the company) reported being mistreated, with women in particular reporting having suffered. In response, Paradox told us that they are \"in the process of bringing in an external, neutral firm to conduct a thorough audit of our processes and a comprehensive employee survey.\" Having your CEO in this situation a week later isn't a great look.\"I understand that this makes my cause less credible when it comes to handling these issues internally,\" Wester said, so he won't be \"involved directly\". It'll be handled by Paradox HR \"with external help\", he says. It's always worth remembering that external firms aren't necessarily neutral, though we don't know who's involved here.\"I sincerely regret making a person in my proximity uncomfortable and for the damage this caused,\" Wester concluded. \"I will continue to work to not only improve myself but also improve the work environment around both Paradox and the industry as a whole.\"Whole lot of work to be done in the games industry.  * Paradox Interactive When not writing news, Alice may be found in the sea.Subscribe and get access to supporter-only articles, an ad-free reading experience, free gifts, and game discounts.

The trip should have been a chance for the monarch to decompress after a difficult year that saw the death of her husband, Prince Philip, and spend time with her loved ones, who routinely visit the remote Victorian estate in Scotland's Dee Valley.Instead, less than 24 hours into the vacation, Britain's royal family was dragged back into crisis as it emerged Prince Andrew was being sued in New York by a woman who alleges she was sexually abused by the senior royal when she was 17.This is not the first time a member of the family has faced legal action, CNN historian and royal expert Kate Williams says. She points out that Prince Charles was sued by a law student in 1978 following an appearance in Ohio. The student sued for alleged deprivation of \"various rights guaranteed by the (US) Constitution,\" (though the case did not progress). And in 2002, Princess Anne became the first member of the royal family to be convicted of a criminal offense, pleading guilty to a charge when her dog bit two children in a park. But those cases pale in comparison with allegations of sexual assault of a minor.Andrew is seen at his father's funeral in April.Virginia Roberts Giuffre's claims are not new but this is the first time she has pursued a civil case against the ninth in line to the British throne, seeking damages in an amount to be determined at trial. A representative for the duke's legal team declined to comment on the fresh litigation on Tuesday, as did Buckingham Palace.Traditionally, the royal family has adopted the mantra of \"never complain, never explain.\" But that crisis management strategy of silence may not suffice this time.Over the years, Andrew has become a recurring character in the Jeffrey Epstein saga. Back in 2019, he sat down with the BBC to answer questions about his links to the late disgraced financier and strenuously denied Giuffre's allegations, saying unequivocally \"it never happened.\" These remarks led to a PR crisis of his own making.That interview, conducted on palace grounds, ignited a firestorm after Andrew's apparent lack of sympathy for Epstein's alleged victims. The disastrous sit-down resulted in the prince's effective exile from royal duties. In a statement at the time, Andrew said he was stepping back \"for the foreseeable future\" and promised \"to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.\" In the years since, Andrew has mostly stayed away from the public eye, choosing to hole up at his Royal Lodge property at Windsor.Despite his public vow to aid officials investigating the alleged sex ring once operated by Epstein and his associates, US officials say otherwise. In January 2020, the then-US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Geoffrey Berman, called out the prince, saying he had \"provided zero cooperation.\" Giuffre's lawyers also say Andrew's legal team have been \"stonewalling\" their efforts for information over the past year, leaving litigation the only course of action -- which brings us to where we are today.## Prince Andrew on Epstein accuser: I don't remember meeting her (2019)More Videos ...Prince Andrew on Epstein accuser: I don't remember meeting her (2019) 01:09Andrew's options at this point are by no means clear cut. According to Melissa Murray, professor of law at New York University, if Andrew's legal team choose not to engage with the civil suit, it could open him up to a directed judgment and possible financial damages. \"What (Giuffre is) seeking here is not his incarceration, not a finding of guilty, it's not a criminal prosecution. It's just a civil suit to take in money damages,\" Murray explains.Civil cases such as these rarely reach the jury trial stage, Murray says, and are instead more commonly resolved through summary judgment or by settlement, the latter of which could be a problem for the royal.\"He is on record as saying that he had nothing to do with her ... and so any effort to settle at this point would appear to be a statement that there is some truth to her allegations,\" Murray explains.It should be noted that Andrew has never faced criminal charges. But Murray points out that if the case were allowed to proceed, it could open the royal up to further scrutiny.\"To allow this to actually go forward -- to have discovery, take depositions, surface evidence -- means that anything that comes up in this civil suit that is made public can then be used as a basis for criminal charges against him, or any other person whose name is surfaced in this particular dispute,\" she says. \"He has a lot of general exposure and things to think about at this point.\"The Queen and Prince Andrew travel to a church service together on August 11, 2019, a day after Epstein died by suicide.Whichever way the court filing unfolds, there's also the PR nightmare the family must now navigate, with royal commentators and legal experts suggesting there may be no coming back from this for Andrew.Nigel Cawthorne, author of \"Prince Andrew: Epstein and the Palace,\" says there seems little recourse for the duke to return to public duties. \"It's very difficult to see how he can come back to the front line of the monarchy, as he's expressed a wish to, with this suit pending or if a court finds against him in absentia.\"Alex McCready, head of reputations and privacy at London law firm Vardags, which specializes in handling the cases of high-profile clients, agrees that fallout from the suit could harm the family's reputation.\"A 'head in the sand' approach by the Royal family will inevitably draw criticism from many quarters,\" she says. \"Whatever path Prince Andrew chooses to take, significant damage has already been done to his own reputation and, arguably, the wider Royal Family, which will be hard to mitigate.\"Hard to recover from but not impossible, according to Amber Melville-Brown, head of the media and reputation practice at international law firm Withers.\"As Prince Charles told broadcaster and author Jeremy Paxman the royal family is, after all, a soap opera. But if that's the case the series isn't going to be axed any time soon,\" Melville-Brown says. \"The monarchy is more than the sum of its family parts. Despite reputational attack it is a series that will not be cancelled, even in today's cancel culture.\"The Queen stands with Princes Charles and Andrew during a flypast of Buckingham Palace in 2019.She adds: \"There is no 'secret sauce' of reputation rehabilitation that suits all tastes. Acceptance, regret, responsibility are some of the ingredients, dignity, empathy and positivity others, while continuing to get the job done is a key element.\"And that's where the Queen excels, because everything she has done throughout her lengthy reign has been in service of her realms.Despite this crisis, there is no evidence that the monarch's reputation has been tarnished by the scandal yet. But in the era of #MeToo and amid a global reckoning on race, authority and privilege, that could change and Andrew will undoubtedly be aware how important his next moves are. _CNN's Ivana Kottasov\u00e1, Nina dos Santos and Ghazi Balkiz contributed reporting._Queen Elizabeth II inspects soldiers from Balaklava Company, 5th Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, at the gates of Balmoral on Monday.

A piece of Prince Charles and Princess Diana's 1981 wedding cake sold for the \"unexpected\" amount of \u00a31,850 ($2,565) at auction this week. It was originally estimated to fetch between \u00a3300-\u00a3500 ($416-$693), but interest spiked ahead of the sale, auctioneer Chris Albury told CNN. \"It really seemed to capture a lot of people's imaginations, and wallets,\" said Albury, adding: \"\u00a31,850 was very unexpected.\" The well-preserved 40-year-old slice has been kept in plastic wrap in an old cake tin. Read the full story here.The cake slice features a coat-of-arms colored in gold, red, blue and silver, a silver horseshoe and leaf spray, as well as some white decorative icing. **Harry was concerned about looking 'weird' in Meghan's birthday video.**Actress Melissa McCarthy has spilled the beans on her recent collaboration with the Sussexes for Meghan's 40th birthday comedy sketch. The \"Bridesmaids\" star called the couple \"so sweet and funny\" before praising them for \"carving out their own lives,\" in an interview with Access Hollywood. In the birthday skit, Meghan and McCarthy cracked jokes before announcing the duchess' new charitable initiative, 40x40, which promotes supporting women as they return to work after the pandemic. McCarthy said she was \"so pleased to be a part of it\" and even shared a tidbit about Harry's involvement. When discussing ideas for the skit, Harry revealed he could juggle but asked if that would look weird. McCarthy recalled saying: \"I was like, weird, in a way that will make me watch it 5 million times.\"## See Prince Harry's sneaky cameo in Meghan's birthday videoMore Videos ...See Prince Harry's sneaky cameo in Meghan's birthday video 01:28Nestled in the lush Scottish Highlands, the Queen's Balmoral residence is said to be one of her favorite places to unwind. This week, the 95-year-old returned to her cherished sanctuary in Aberdeenshire for her annual summer getaway.The property has been in the family since 1852, when Queen Victoria and Prince Albert bought it, but the original castle was actually built in the 15th century. Through the generations, monarchs are said to have found \"peace and tranquility\" at the 50,000-acre estate.The Royal Standard flies from the turrets of Balmoral Castle in Ballater, Scotland, when the Queen is in residence.Balmoral is a private residence owned by the family, rather than one of the royal palaces owned by the Crown Estate. \"It's the most beautiful place on earth. I think Granny is the most happy there,\" Princess Eugenie said in the ITV documentary \"Our Queen At Ninety.\"When asked why, the princess said: \"Walks, picnics, dogs -- a lot of dogs, there's always dogs -- and people coming in and out all the time.\"In this September 1960 photo, the Queen and Prince Philip pose on the lawn at Balmoral with their children, Prince Andrew, center, Princess Anne, left, and Prince Charles.The family clearly enjoy the freedom of being outdoors without the spotlight. Other royal activities in years gone by included games and outdoor grilling sessions, with Prince Harry hailing the late Duke of Edinburgh as \"master of the barbecue.\"Some members of the royal family have also been known to enjoy grouse-shooting on the local moors while many have joined spectators at the Braemar highland games, a competitive event that showcases Scottish athletes and musicians -- sadly canceled again this year due to the pandemic.> \"Despite the many difficulties in training and getting to the Games during the pandemic, everyone involved in Team GB has played a significant role in a magnificent performance.\"> Princess Anne praised Team GB's success at Tokyo 2020.The Princess Royal, who is president of the British Olympic Association, wrote a moving message celebrating the team's achievements at this year's Games.

This story follows Alex Chen, a young woman with a troubled background of foster homes, who reunites with her brother only for him to be killed in a mysterious accident. She'll use her psychic empathy powers to read and manipulate others' emotions, in order to investigate the truth behind her brother's death.(Image credit: Bethesda)Imagine Groundhog Day, but you're two assassins who end up killing each other every day, and then repeat ad nauseam. Well, that's Deathloop. The game takes place in the mysterious Black Reef, in what's described as a \"time of madness\". In development at Arkane Lyon, it's clear that our two assassins have very different ideas of their current situation. Juliana wants to protect it, while Cole hopes to break free of their never-ending cycle, but what they always do is kill each other. Over and over again.(Image credit: Ember Lab) **Platform(s):** PS4, PS5, PC (Epic Games Store)  **Release date** : September 21, 2021This new and adorable adventure from developer Ember Lab sees you play as Kena, a young spirit guide who sets out to find a sacred mountain shrine in an abandoned village populated by trapped spirits. Kena is also joined by adorable little fuzzy spirits known as the Rot who we already immediately want a plushie of. Helping you along the way, you can collect the Rot throughout your journey to gain abilities and alter the environment around you to progress. It certainly gives off some Pikmin vibes and a lot of charm.(Image credit: Shedworks) **Platform(s):** Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC  With a gorgeous art style, an original soundtrack, and an interesting premise, Sable already looks and sounds very promising. From indie developer Shedworks, you play as Sable who sets out on her \"gliding\", which is said to be a rite of passage that will see you travel across expansive deserts. As you venture through the landscape, you can explore it in whatever way you wish at your own pace. From traveling on your hoverbike (yes, you have a hoverbike), to climbing ruins, or walking on foot, you can solve puzzles and encounter other nomads who might just ask for your help.(Image credit: Ubisoft) **Platform(s):** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC  **Release date** : October 7, 2021Yes, that's right. Far Cry is returning once again. Set in Yara, which is described as a \"tropical paradise frozen in time\", Far Cry 6 sees you play as a local Yaran called Dani Rojas. Taking on the role of a guerrilla fighter, you set out to take down the dictatorship regime of  Anton Castillo (played by Giancarlo Esposito). As the leader of Yara, Castillo wants to restore the nation back to its former glory, and he's willing to do it by any means necessary.(Image credit: Nintendo)For the first time in 19 years, we've got a new 2D Metroid game inbound. Metroid Dread will finally end the story that began way back in 1986 and bring the 2D Metroid games to Switch for the first time. It takes some ideas from the 3DS Metroid: Samus Returns release, but also some ideas from the likes of Alien: Isolation. New robotic enemies known as the E.M.M.I, which will hunt Samus down the minute they hear her moving through their patrol zones. Using new abilities like a Phantom Cloak that turns Samus invisible for a little while, you may just be able to evade them. But, basically, prepare to run - a lot.(Image credit: Warner Bros.) **Platform(s):** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC  Left 4 Dead 3 in all but name, Back 4 Blood is the same four-player co-op zombie experience that you'd expect from the Valve series - just without the Valve involvement. We dove into the game's recent alpha and can confirm it has the same frantic energy as the Left 4 Dead games, the humor, distinctive style, and of course, lots and lots of zombies. It's going to be beautiful chaos.(Image credit: EA) **Platform(s):** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC  Battlefield is back and we're going near-future with this one. Battlefield 2042 will offer huge 128-player battles when it launches later this year via its all-out warfare modes Conquest and Breakthrough. There are more to come though, including Hazard Zone, but the real pull is the vast, dynamic maps set across the globe. Each of these will feature ever-changing battle conditions and gameplay challenges, forcing players to constantly adapt to things like sandstorms, rocket launches, and tornadoes.(Image credit: Square Enix) **Platform(s):**  Xbox Series X, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PC  Eidos Montreal is bringing us a brand new Marvel game in the form of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. You'll be playing as Star-Lord, leading the Guardians as they try to save the universe from a problem of their own (accidental) creation. While you play solely as Star-Lord, you'll have to make decisions for the team, and will be able to command them in battle too. Plus, it's all set to a suitably amazing 80s soundtrack.(Image credit: Xbox Game Studios)Age of Empires 4 will let players explore history once more with a campaign set across eight civilizations across history - from Joan of Arc against the English to Genghis Khan and his conquest of Asia. You'll need to build cities, manage your resources, and lead your troops into battle both on land and at sea. There are four distinct campaigns, with 35 missions spanning over 500 years of history from the Dark Ages to the Renaissance.(Image credit: Ubisoft) **Platform(s):** PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC, Stadia  What Ubisoft is hoping will be your new favorite social space is en route, and it's Riders Republic. With up to 50 players active on your map simultaneously, Riders Republic will let you and your friends explore a huge open world created by stitching together iconic US national parks including Yosemite, and Grand Teton. The game features a range of sports to take part in - biking, snowboarding, skiing, and the flying wingsuit - with plenty to get involved with too. Head to the stunt parks, climb mountains, collect objects, or just discover the best scenic spots - there's going to be lots to discover.(Image credit: Activision) **Platform(s):** PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One  **Release date** : November 5, 2021Call of Duty: Vanguard is taking us back to WW2, with its campaign following the stories of four characters based on real fighters - Sgt. Arthur Kingsley, of Britain's 9th Parachute Battalion; Captain Wade Jackson, of the US's Scouting Squadron Six; Second Lieutenant Lucas Riggs, of Australia's 20th Battalion; and Lt. Polina Petrova, of the Soviet 138th Rifle Division. It looks set to explore the horrors of war from the perspective of some of the untold stories of that time, and is probably one of the best looking new-gen games yet.(Image credit: Frontier Developments) **Platform(s):** PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One **  Release date:** November 9, 2021Jurassic World Evolution 2 is bringing back more dinosaur park simulation action, but this time we're going bigger - and deeper - than before. There'll be a new campaign to play through, more dinosaur breeds, new biome options for your enclosures, and enhanced customisation options too. The new Chaos Theory feature will also allow you to replay key moments of your favorite Jurassic Park / Jurassic World films but with a twist, allowing for some spectacular 'what if' moments.(Image credit: Playground Games) **Platform(s):** Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC  The Forza Festival is back, but this time we're going to Mexico! That's right, Forza Horizon 5 is taking us to South America later this year, offering up one of the most beautiful Xbox Series X graphical showcases yet. Developer Playground Games is promising that this is its biggest, most fun, and most diverse title in the series, with the Mexican setting offering a vast range of different biomes to explore. Plus, expect area-specific weather systems, more character creation options, and of course, more cars.(Image credit: Techland)No calendar is complete without a zombie game or two on the horizon, and Dying Light 2 has a good chance of being the only zombie game you'll need for the foreseeable future. Techland got off to fantastic start with the original Dying Light in 2015, and its sequel intends to healthily expand those parameters in every regard. With its reactive world, branching narrative, finessed combat, and radically upgraded visuals, Dying Light 2 is everything you could hope for in one, beautifully apocalyptic package, and then some. There's no release information as of yet, but our barbed wire baseball bats are already prepared and eager for zombie blood.(Image credit: Microsoft Xbox) **Platform(s)** : PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X  **Release date** : December 8, 2021Bearing a curious new sub-header and running on a brand new game engine known as Slipspace, the first Halo Infinite trailer almost seems to suggest that Master Chief's next adventure will have MMO qualities to it, or at least be more open-ended and sandbox-like in flavour. That instantly familiar shot of his armour also teases a potential technological downgrade for everyone's favourite Spartan, though plot details remain threadbare for now. MMO or otherwise, Halo: Infinite could just be the Halo comeback we've all been waiting for.(Image credit: Sony)Solar Ash is the latest game from Hyper Light Drifter and will see players journey through a rift in space known as the Ultravoid, which just happens to be swallowing entire worlds. The game is quite the personal experience, where the characters must find solace in each other as they look to evolve their struggle into something a little more hopeful.(Image credit: Deep Silver) **Platform(s):** Xbox Series X, Xbox One  Name me one other game where you play as a sentient spaceship. Go on, try. Well, welcome Chorus, a brand new space-flight combat shooter, where you play as Nara and Forsaken, her sentient starfighter. Taking the genre straight into the next-generation of consoles, Chorus looks pretty awesome, melding exploration across the universe with outgunning your enemies in an epic quest to free an oppressed galaxy.(Image credit: FromSoftware) **Platform(s)** : PS4, Xbox One, PC, PS5, Xbox Series X  **Release date** : January 21, 2022Originally announced during E3 2019, _Elden Ring_ is the next FromSoftware offering from Dark Souls creator Hidetaka Miyazaka and Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin. In what will be FromSoftware's biggest game to date, Elden Ring takes place in an open world filled with rich lore and a bloody history. Much of the story of the upcoming dark fantasy action RPG remains a mystery, but from an _Xbox Wire_ interview with Miyazaka last year, we do know that the Elden Ring \"is the name given to a mysterious concept that defines the world itself,\" and it has been shattered. The consequences of this will be one of the important themes of the game. Steeped in mystery, Elden Ring looks full of promise.(Image credit: The Pokemon Company)The first open-world Pokemon game ever, Pokemon Legends: Arceus has undoubtedly caused quite the commotion in the fandom. Set long before any of the series entries to date, you'll be exploring Sinnoh in a unique adventure to create the region's first Pokedex. Catching Pokemon will be as simple as throwing a Pokeball at them whilst creeping towards them out in the open, which will seamlessly enter you into a battle. It's the Pokemon game we've all been dreaming of.(Image credit: Ubisoft) **Platform(s):** PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PC, Google Stadia, Amazon Luna  Formerly known as Rainbow Six Quarantine, we're now looking at Rainbow Six Extraction - the name changed for very good reasons of course. This is a spin-off from Rainbow Six Siege, offering similar co-operative multiplayer action where you must work with your squad to combat and defeat a type of parasite-esque alien called the Archaeans.(Image credit: Sloclap)Sifu is the brand new game from Sloclap, the developer that gave us Absolver. In this though, you play as a young Kung-Fu student looking for vengeance after the murder of his family. The game is focused on a unique aging mechanic, where if you make a mistake you can trade off your life to try again, and learn from your errors. But, get too old and you will die, forcing you to start over again.  (Image credit: Volition) **Platfom(s):**  PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PC  Saints Row is coming back with a complete reboot of the series. You'll be building the Sains from the ground up, playing as the Boss with a small group of friends just starting out. It'll be your decisions that will shape the newly formed gang, and you'll be able to make your mark on the fictional city of Santo Ileso by deciding what kind of crime lord you want to be. Drug smuggling? Arms running? You decide. This is the Saints' origin story, and you get to tell it your way.(Image credit: Guerrilla Games)Aloy is officially back in a sequel to 2017's Horizon Zero Dawn, and this time we'll be journeying to the post-apocalyptic setting of San Franciso in America. The trailer which debuted during Sony's Future of Gaming event revealed Horizon Forbidden West will be coming to the PS5, and showed off gorgeous, vibrant landscapes, new big machines creatures, and - most interestingly of all - underwater sequences. We'll no doubt have more mysteries to unravel as we return to Guerrilla Games' unique world when it does eventually release on the next-gen console.(Image credit: Marvel) **Platform(s):** PS5, Xbox Series X, PS4, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch **  Release date:** March 2022Firaxis, the developer behind the XCOM series, is bringing us Marvel's Midnight Suns - a supernatural strategy game featuring 12 iconic Marvel heroes. These Midnight Suns characters are banding together to take on Lillith, the Mother of Demons. But, they'll also need help from The Hunter - aka you, the first-ever customizable Marvel hero.(Image credit: GSC Game World)In this one, you'll be exploring the vast Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in the highly anticipated sequel to the original title. The Zone is a much tougher place to survive than before, especially after the second explosion hit the nuclear reactor. There are violent mutants, deadly anomalies, and warring factions all to contend with - and an incredible power at the center of the Zone that may provide an even more serious threat.(Image credit: Bethesda)Arkane Austin is making a brand new open-world, co-op shooter called Redfall. Set in the island town of Redfall, Massachusetts, the place is under siege by vampires who have blocked out the sun and complete access to the island. You're trapped with a handful of other survivors, who must team up and use innovative weaponry to try to become the ultimate vampire slayers. Think UV blasters and stake guns and you're getting there.  (Image credit: Bethesda)Bethesda's first new IP in 25 years, Starfield, is so wrapped up in mystique and profundity right now, that we're not even sure if it'll be releasing on this generation of console hardware. Here's what we do know: it's set an open world RPG set in space, and Bethesda has been working on it for  _years_. Sorry, but that's about it for now, but at least the studio was kind enough to confirm its existence after so many whispers amongst the industry. Given Bethesda's pedigree, Starfield is now one of the most promising titles of the future, and I can't wait to play it, even if it might not launch until we get our hands on next-gen consoles.(Image credit: Gearbox) **Platform(s):** PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PC  Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is a fantasy-inspired Borderlands spin-off, focusing on the titular Borderlands character Tiny Tina (voiced by Ashly Burch). The game will be a story-driven co-op campaign for up to four players, but unlike other Borderlands titles will be a high-fantasy setting full of monsters, treasures, and even a Dragon Lord. Tiny Tina makes the rules in this world though, like some kind of Dungeon Master, so expect things to go brilliantly awry on the regular.(Image credit: Night School Studio)The 2016 breakout indie hit Oxenfree is getting a sequel in the form of Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals. Developer Night School Studio is delivering us another supernatural mystery to unravel as heroine Riley returns to her hometown of Camena, but discovers a little more than she expected. Other than Riley though, expect a whole new cast of characters, as the developer says it's a new story that also offers an entry point into the games without having played the first entry. Although, you totally should play it!(Image credit: Bethesda)As people start evaporating from the neon-lit streets of Toyko, it's clear that something's not quite right. In Ghostwire: Tokyo strange shadowy figures begin patrolling the streets, and terrifying monsters based on Japanese lore and legends. It's being made by the same studio that brought you survival horror The Evil Within, which is promising. Especially as it sounds like it's filled with paranormal entities, supernatural events, conspiracies, and the occult.(Image credit: Warner Brother Games) **Platform(s):** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC  WB Games Montreal is working on a brand new Batman game, but there's a catch - Batman's been killed. The Gotham Knights are taking over the protection of what the studio is calling the \"most dynamic and interactive Gotham City yet\", with unique abilities and skill trees available for each of the four Knights - Red Hood, Nightwing, Robin, and Batgirl. It's a drop-in, drop-out co-op affair, with an open-world action-adventure gameplay style. Expect to see plenty of DC villains try to take control of Gotham in Batman's absence, meaning the Gotham Knights have definitely got their hands full. But, with combat looking very Batman: Arkham-esque, you'll have plenty of tricks up your batsleeves.(Image credit: Sony)Ever wanted a game where you play as a little street cat? Well, now's your chance. This is Stray, and as the title suggests, you play as a stray kitty exploring a cyberpunk world filled with robots. Because of your stature, you'll be able to sneak under cars, clamber over rooftops, and even be a little bit sneaky. Your task is to untangle an ancient mystery to escape this long-forgotten city, enlisting the help of a small drone, known only as B12.(Image credit: Bandai Namco) **Platform(s):** PS5, Xbox Series X, PC  Park Beyond is a brand new theme park sim coming to new-gen and PC, and it's being made by Limbic Entertainment - the team behind Tropico 6. It might not be trying to reinvent the genre wheel, but it is doing something a little different. Introducing the word \"Impossification\" as the theme for the campaign and the features at large, you'll be playing as a visionary brought in to breathe life into an ageing theme park. Classic rides are getting improvements that take them beyond reality, beyond gravity's pull, and beyond current imagination - hence the word impossification. It's silly, but it just might be brilliant.(Image credit: Annapurna Interactive) **Platform(s):** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC  Get ready for a road trip with Tess Devine and her mother Opal as they set out to uncover their family secrets. After discovering notes and letters tucked away in the attic of their home, the mother-daughter duo journeys to visit old abandoned family properties to learn more about their family history. Revisiting memories that each property holds, Open Roads explores the relationship between Tess and Opal and takes them on \"a journey into the past they'll never forget\". From Gone Home and Tacoma developer Fullbright, this notable upcoming adventure features the voice acting talents of Keri Russel and Kaitlyn Dever.  (Image credit: Daedelic Entertainment)Prepare yourself to become precious with Lord of the Rings: Gollum, a brand new game from Daedalic Entertainment where you play as, unsurprisingly, Gollum. Starting out in Barad-dur, the Mordor fortress where Gollum is being held captive, the game will take you through plenty of Middle-Earth's locations with promises of \"giant, persistent environments, each harbouring several questlines and a range of friendly or unfriendly faces\" - according to the developer in an interview with Edge magazine anyway. Aesthetically the game is inspired by Tolkien's own drawings and plays out like a stealth-action-adventure game that takes advantage of Gollum's dual personalities too.(Image credit: Monomi Park)Monomi Park's adorable ranching sim is back with a sequel simply titled Slime Rancher 2. You'll be back playing as Beatrix LeBeau, but she's off to a new and rather mysterious rainbow-hued island - called Rainbow Island - where there are new slimes to discover beyond those of the Far Far Range. There are new slimes to discover - cotton slime, angler slime, batty slime, and flutter slime among those revealed so far - all of which you can use to fill your new conservatory farm.(Image credit: Nintendo)Splatoon 3 will take players away from Inkopolis to a new region known as the Splatlands. At its heart, the city of Splatsville is home to battle-savvy inklings that you'll be able to cross ink with. The latest series' entry will bring with it a new bow wepaon, increased customisation options, and new movement abilities to the usual 4v4 multiplayer matches.(Image credit: Focus Home Interactive) **Platform(s):** PS5, Xbox Series X, PC, Nintendo Switch **  Release date:** TBC 2022A Plague Tale: Requiem is the surprise sequel to the original A Plague Tale: Innocence that released in 2019. You'll be following the same two heroes, Amicia and her younger brother Hugo, who will have to do whatever it takes to survive in the game's brutal world. Rats will still be a huge problem, but there is more here than just a literal sea of rats to be worried about.## Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope(Image credit: Ubisoft)Ubisoft and Nintendo's brilliant tactical crossover is back for a second installment. Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope will see our heroes embarking on a galactic adventure trying to stop a new villain called Cursa, who wants to absorb the world's energy. They've got more help this time around, with new faces like Rabbid Rosalina and the titular Sparks (hybrids of Super Mario Galaxy's Luma and the Rabbids) to assist. The game is also offering players more freedom, both in exploration by opening up the overworld to offer more secrets, free traversal and more, and in combat by doing away with the grid system in favor of free control within areas of attack.(Image credit: Striking Distance) **Platform(s)** : PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S  Fans of survival horror may want to have The Callisto Protocol on their internal motion sensor. Debuting from new studio Striking Distance, the next-gen survival horror game takes place within a maximum security prison on Jupiter's moon, and promises plenty of gruesome alien nightmare fuel. Devised from Glen Schofield, the man we have to thank for Dead Space, The Callisto Protocol also technically takes place in the PUBG universe - yes, _that_ PUBG universe. See, _now_ you're interested.(Image credit: Warner Bros. ) **Platform(s):** PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S  While not a direct adaptation of the Harry Potter books, Hogwarts Legacy is taking all of its inspo straight from the lore. You'll be playing as a student attending Hogwarts during the 1800s, some hundreds of years before Harry and co were born, but no doubt will get up to plenty of wizardy mischief. It's an open world RPG, so expect plenty to explore too.(Image credit: Studio Wildcard) **Platform(s)** : PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S  The dinosaur hunting PC hit is back with a bigger, ballsier sequel that features none other than Vin Diesel both in front and behind of the digital camera. Yep, the Fast & Furious star is not only playing a key character in the next-gen survival game, but he's joined series developer Studio Wildcard as an executive producer, having long been a fan of the original game. Goodness knows what that means for the final product\u2026 perhaps the dinosaurs were part of our family all along?  (Image credit: Ubisoft) **Platform(s):** PS5, Xbox Series X, PC, Stadia, Luna  The long-awaited Avatar game - now officially called Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - finally got revealed at E3 2021, and it's in development at Massive Entertainment (in collaboration with Lightstorm Entertainment and Disney). The game will be a new standalone story where you plas as a Na'vi and journey across the Western Frontier, which is a brand new part of Pandora not seen in any media before. This is a first-person, action-adventure title, with a living and reactive world that's fighting against the formidable RDA forces.## Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League(Image credit: Warner Bros.) **Platform(s):** PS5, Xbox Series X, PC  Set to arrive sometime in 2022, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League sees you playing as our squad of chaotic semi-heroes. Squad up as Harley Quinn, King Shark, Deadshot, or Captain Boomerang, with bots or other players taking the role of the other four as you play. Set in the Batman: Arkham universe, Rocksteady has already said this is a continuation of the previous games, so prepare to see some existing threads and storylines come to fruition.(Image credit: Scavengers)From sunset skies to the grassy fields, what we've seen of Season so far in the official trailer looks absolutely gorgeous. Following a young woman who leaves a secluded community to explore the world for the first time, you go on a road trip on your bicycle, drawing, photographing, documenting, and recording the life around you. Set to immersive you in a variety of different societies in its \"surreal version of the mid-twentieth century, where thousands of years have passed without any progress,\" Season's atmospheric setting and focus on exploration adds to its appeal.(Image credit: Obsidian Entertainment)Revealed with a cheeky piss-take out of most game trailers, The Outer Worlds 2 is coming. While info on the game is scarce for now, developer Obsidian says the title will deliver a \"new solar system, new crew, same outer worlds\".(Image credit: Microsoft)Forza developer Playground Games is making a hard pivot into RPG territory with the next iteration of Xbox's Fable series, which hasn't seen a mainline entry since 2010's Fable 3. Developed exclusively for Xbox Series X and S, Fable 4 will utilise the enhanced power of the next-generation hardware for a more magical escape into the fantasy of Albion. Just\u2026 don't expect to be speeding around its medieval towns in a Bugatti 64.(Image credit: BioWare)The next major project from BioWare after the disastrous Anthem, Dragon Age 4 will continue the story left off by 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition, positioning former companion Solas as the upcoming RPG's central antagonist. We know little else about the game beyond this, but you can expect plenty of tactical combat, NPC chatter, and - yes - dragon hunting. Hopefully the early months of 2021 will provide more details about when Dragon Age 4 is anticipated to drop.(Image credit: BioWare)In addition to Dragon Age 4, BioWare has also confirmed its returning to the final frontier with a new entry in its long-running Mass Effect series. A brief teaser trailer released at the end of 2020 was all that was needed to get us excited, showing the return of a fan favourite character in Liara, who appears older and wiser than the last time we saw her, and is seemingly on the hunt for Commander Shephard's ship, the Normandy. What could it all mean? BioWare's staying quiet for now, but we're already preparing for launch.  (Image credit: The Initiative)We've long wondered what Microsoft's newly established first-party The Initiative has been up to for the last few years - turns out the answer was more exciting than any of us could have expected. Resurrecting Rare's cult classic franchise for the next-generation, Perfect Dark could be the next killer exclusive for Microsoft's Xbox family, though we're yet to see anything beyond the intriguing cinematic which debuted in 2020. Here's hoping the studio doesn't remain in the dark for much longer.Sidebar is back with another RPG about sports... but that's not all it's about. Just like Golf Story, Sports Story lets you get up to a variety of different shenanigans as well as a healthy dose of sports. You can explore dungeons, go fishing, and much more besides. Instead of just playing golf though, you can play all sorts of different sports such as tennis, hockey, football, and baseball. With lots of fun sporty antics and adventuring to be had, Sports Story looks like another entertaining pixelated delight.(Image credit: Ubisoft)Sea of Thieves isn't the only open-world pirate game out there - Ubisoft's Skull and Bones is also setting sail, with a much more realistic take on pirate battles on the high seas. Skull and Bones is basically Assassin's Creed: Black Flag without the Assassins, as it's being developed by much of the same team behind Black Flag, and promises a sweeping solo campaign as you vie for control over the 18th-century waters in the Indian Ocean. But the real focus looks to be player-versus-player ship skirmishes online, where each player controls their very own warship in team-based fleet battles. There will also be supernatural elements amidst all the cannon-fire, like the colossal tentacles of a terrifying kraken lurking in the deep.(Image credit: Rare)Everwild is a new IP from Rare exclusively for Xbox One that has already caught our attention thanks to its wonderful art style and enchanting world. We really don't know much about this new adventure yet, but the mystery surrounding it just makes it all the more tantalising. Set in a \"natural and magical world,\" Everwild promises to take us on an unforgettable experience. From the trailer that debuted at X019, it's certainly shaping up to be one to keep an eye on. We can hardly wait to find out more about Everwild's world and the many creatures that appear to inhabit it.(Image credit: Neostream Interactive) **Platforms:** PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, PC  After starting life as a Kickstarter project, Little Devil Inside actually appeared in the big PS5 showcase in 2020. This is an RPG with survival elements involved, and quite the little sense of humour. It's set in a Victorian-esque era, where you're tasked with discovering - and fighting - a range of bizarre monsters. It looks like quite the romp.(Image credit: Team Cherry)Release date:** TBCTeam Cherry is bringing us another Hollow Knight adventure with Silksong. This time we follow the journey of Princess Hornet - protector of the Hollownest - who's been captured and taken to a strange and distant world. With over 150 new foes and new moves to master, you'll get to explore new towns, complete quests, and try out new tools in this unfamiliar kingdom. The interconnected world Team Cherry has brought to life in its beautiful hand-crafted 2D style is filled with a variety of different vistas that all look absolutely gorgeous, and with so many new features and foes to encounter, Silksong is one jam-packed sequel to watch out for.(Image credit: Bethesda)Announced with a teenie teaser trailer, there's a new Indiana Jones game inbound from MachineGames, Bethesda, and Lucasfilm Games. From the clues hidden in the trailer, it looks like we're looking at an Indy story set in 1937, with our whip-touting hero exploring the standing stones and stone circles of Italy. That date puts it after Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Temple of Doom, and yet before The Last Crusade, which is interesting too. From the hints, it may even be that we're looking at the story involving a lost race of giant cyclops too.(Image credit: Ubisoft)Lucasfilm Games has announced that is working with Ubisoft's Massive Entertainment on an open-world Star Wars game. Now, apart from that, details are quite scarce - beyond that it'll run on Massive's own Snowdrop engine. We imagine it'll take plenty of DNA from Massive's The Division titles, so expect a game focused on photorealism with an action-adventure focus and added RPG elements when it does arrive. It's clearly in very stages of development though, so don't hold your breath for more info on this one any time soon.(Image credit: Avalanche Studios)Contraband is a brand new co-op game coming from Avalanche Studios - the team behind Just Cause. It's set in the fictional world of 1970s Bayan, and will be quite the smuggler's paradise. Not much is known about the game yet, but the studio says it is \"pushing the boundaries with the next generation of [its] Apex Engine\" for the title.(Image credit: PlatinumGames)Thank you Nintendo: first you made Bayonetta 2 possible by bankrolling a Wii U sequel, and now you're giving Platinum fans more of their favourite bullet-blasting witch with Bayonetta 3 on the Switch (in addition to Switch ports of the first two games). All we have to go on so far is a brief cinematic teaser, but its implications are dire: Bayonetta is caught in a losing battle under a blood moon, deprived of her guns (and quite possibly her entire legs) by a mysterious enemy bathed in purple flames. Looks like your precision third-person action combat skills are about to be tested like never before.(Image credit: Io Interactive) **Platform(s):** PS5, Xbox Series X, PC  In the works at IO Interactive, Project 007 (working title) is a James Bond origin story that's set to descend on consoles and PC at some point in the future. The game will feature an entirely original James Bond story, but not much is known about exactly what that will be yet. According to MGM's Robert Marick, IO was chosen because of their position as \"masters of crafting living, breathing worlds of immersive storytelling\".(Image credit: Ninja Theory)Release Date:** TBCThe surprise reveal of the Xbox Series X at The Game Awards also came with this first look at a sequel to the affecting Hellblade. While the trailer doesn't give too much away (apart from the fact it's all in-engine) about what this sequel will entail, don't expect Senua's story to have got any lighter since we last saw her. The disconcerting chanting, flashes of foreboding bonfires, and a man seemingly buried in a rock hint at another harrowing journey that will hopefully make as much of an impact as the original.(Image credit: EA) **Platform(s):**  PS5, Xbox Series X, PC  Motive Studios at EA has revealed that it has been beavering away on a remake of the original Dead Space - one of the best horror games of all time. This version has been \"rebuilt\" from the source material, but removes loading screens, keeps it micro-transaction free, and may well even add in some additional content that was cut from the original. Arriving on new-gen consoles and PC exclusively, this will no doubt be the best version of the game yet.(Image credit: Nintendo)You know a series is popular when a teaser showing literally nothing besides a numbered logo can garner 2 million views on YouTube. At E3 2017, Nintendo dropped a bombshell by confirming the existence of Metroid Prime 4 \\- only to later announce that Metroid Prime 4 has been delayed and rebooted as Nintendo passes it to original trilogy dev Retro Studios. It could be a while before we see this one, but it'll hopefully be worth the extra wait.(Image credit: Blizzard)Officially confirmed at BlizzCon 2019, _Diablo 4_ is set to take us to hell and back with what looks like a devilishly good sequel filled with dungeon crawling goodness. Set in the world of Sanctuary, you'll battle against The Burning Hells in an always online experience that will enable you to fight alongside other adventurers. So far we know of three classes you'll be able to choose from including Druid, Sorceress, and Barbarian. Oh, and remember Lilith from Diablo 2? Well, she's returning in the fourth instalment and from the sounds of it, she'll be causing some trouble for us as one of the game's main antagonists. Her return \"ushers in an age of darkness of misery,\" so you better prepare yourselves.(Image credit: Ubisoft)At long last, Michel Ancel and his team at Ubisoft have confirmed one of the most asked-for, anticipated sequels of our time. Beyond Good and Evil 2 is actually a prequel to Jade and Pey'j's journalistic escapades in the original game, taking on a much grander scale in a cyberpunk, Luc Besson-looking future full of high-tech ships and anthropomorphic animals. The lively crew of space pirates in BG&E2's cinematic reveal trailer are just some of many - you'll be starting from scratch with the hopes of one day reaching their level of professional thievery, visiting (and stealing from) the residents of multiple cities on myriad planets.  (Image credit: Bethesda)After years of prevaricating, party pooping, and a preposterous number of Skyrim re-releases, Bethesda came out at E3 2018 to finally confirm that The Elder Scrolls 6 is officially on the way, even releasing a short but exciting teaser trailer to prove it. That trailer in question doesn't reveal a whole lot, but suggests a number of potential settings for the long awaited sequel, from the long forgotten High Rock to the lost island of Yokuda. Sadly, this RPG is likely to stay in production for quite some time, but the more hopeful adventurers wouldn't be completely mad for expecting The Elder Scrolls 6 to release before the end of the decade. Fingers crossed.(Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment)Blizzard revealed that its cast of heroes would be returning in a new sequel during BlizzCon 2019. Yes, _Overwatch 2_ is happening, and this time it'll change up the game with more of a focus on the storytelling and lore of the Overwatch universe thanks to the addition of Story Missions. In these missions, players will be pitted against AI foes rather than other players. The sequel also includes Hero Missions, which was described as a \"deeply replayable co-op experience\" by Overwatch 2's assistant game director _Aaron Keller_. Set in a variety of locations all over the world, Hero Missions will let players level up heroes and use different elements to modify abilities and power levels. With new characters and lots of additional content, it's already shaping up to be quite an exciting sequel.(Image credit: Owlcat Games)Expect the second game set in the Pathfinder universe to lovingly honor the tabletop game upon which it's based, in the way that only developer OwlCat can. After the massive success of 2018's Pathfinder: Kingmaker, the team is bringing us a brand new story set in the beloved universe: enter a part of the world that was captured by demons nearly a hundred years ago, choose from more classes, cast more spells, and enjoy more verticality in the maps. Chris Avellone rejoins Kingmaker's Creative Director Alexander Mishulin and Lead Writer Alexander Komzolov for the sequel, so expect richly dense characters, fleshed-out dialogue options, and some serious consequences for your in-game choices. Plus, Owlcat has listened to fan feedback, so the game will be about 40 hours shorter than the behemoth that was Kingmaker. We got a chance to preview the game, and we're certain it'll delight Kingmaker and anyone partial to a tabletop-inspired video game world.(Image credit: FYQD) **Platform(s)** : PC, Xbox Series X  Take the parkour of Mirror's Edge but add a sprinkling of samurais, swords and big ass guns, and you have Bright Memory: Infinite - a fast-action game with touches of FPS, where getting dazzling combos is the ultimate aim. It's the year 2036 and you're in a futuristic city, playing as an agent for the Supernatural Science Research Organization (SRO). You've been sent out to discover what's happening with the strange sky phenomenon that's been happening, which seems to be connected to an archaic mystery and the discovery of two worlds. It's all rather beautiful, but also mysterious.(Image credit: Ebb Studios) **Platform(s)** : Xbox Series X, PC  With an art style heavily influenced by Alien's H.R. Geiger, Scorn is a horror shooter with an obsession with everything boney, fleshy, and internal organ\u2026 y. Guns look like they're made from gristle and meaty offcuts, so it's certainly not for the squeamish. Figuring out exactly what's going on here is part of the appeal, or gross charm, of Scorn, as you'll be exploring, fighting and solving puzzles to understand the state of things. Prepare yourself.(Image credit: Mundfish) **Platform(s):** PS5, Xbox Series X, PC, PS4, Xbox One  Atomic Heart is a weird, atmospheric horror shooter with some of the freakiest looking monsters we've seen in recent memory, and we can't look away. Originally announced in 2020, Mundfish's vision of a dystopian USSR equipped with robots and holograms is now due to launch on PS5, Xbox Series X, PC, and last-gen consoles.## Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake(Image credit: Ubisoft)Ubisoft is bringing back one of the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube era's most memorable titles with a fresh remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. It might sound surprising for a studio that's been around so long, but this marks Ubisoft's first full-fledged remake, distinct from other titles they've simply remastered for newer hardware. That said, The Sands of Time remake is pretty darn faithful to the original, just with modern graphics and gameplay.## Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2(Image credit: Paradox Interactive) **Platform(s)** : PC, Xbox One, PS4  After the release of the first Vampire Masquerade: Bloodlines in 2004, nothing came as close to a great vampire RPG since. Thankfully, Hardsuit Labs and Paradox Interactive are bringing bloodlines back with a sequel that promises to take us on an immersive role-playing experience as a vampire thrown into the world of bloodsuckers in Seattle. As a newly sired vampire, you'll find yourself caught up in Blood trade war between competing vampire factions. With dialogue options, alliances to be made, and choices to make, Bloodlines 2 looks like it's shaping up to fill the void the first game left behind it. _Take a look back at the year with our pick of the_ _best games of 2020_ _.  _GamesRadar+ was first founded in 1999, and since then has been dedicated to delivering video game-related news, reviews, previews, features, and more.

Check back every Friday for a new entry._As much as gaming is a thriving industry right now, there's no shortage of bad news in the headlines. It can be discouraging seeing a near-constant succession of stories about abusive studios and communities rife with racism, sexism, xenophobia, and general intolerance of all stripes.Sometimes the avalanche of bad news might make it seem like we're living through a uniquely terrible moment in games, but I actually think it's a sign of progress in the industry.Consider the stories of toxic workplaces, and how many of them detail long-standing patterns of behavior, cultures built on sexism or crunch at studios and publishers that have been doing their dirt for decades. In generations past, these stories simply wouldn't be told in public.> \"Developers have always crunched, but industry attitudes have shifted from glorifying it, to tolerating it as a necessary evil, to regarding it somewhere between irresponsible and exploitive\"It's not like poor work-life balance is a recent innovation in the industry. Developers have always crunched, but industry attitudes have shifted from glorifying it, to tolerating it as a necessary evil, to regarding it somewhere between irresponsible and exploitive.We may not look at the outcomes of these stories as any kind of justice for the wrongs done and the harms caused, especially considering how often the leaders who built and oversaw toxic cultures are left in place to deal with the problems they created. But at the very least there's a much greater understanding in the industry -- and critically, a greater understanding for people just entering it -- that workplaces like this are not acceptable, that they cannot be the norm.As frustrating as it might be for veterans to see the companies that wronged them paying lip service to the need for healthy and supportive workplaces, the next generation of developers have them on the record now and can insist they live up to those sentiments. (Or call them out for failing to do so, at the very least undermining recruitment efforts in the process.)The increased awareness and volume around these issues has not only given some momentum to unionization efforts in the industry, but it has (perhaps not coincidentally) prompted more companies to explore alternative ways of working more explicitly centered around employees' work-life balance and well-being, whether through shorter work weeks, allowing remote working, or other measures.And as for the bigotry against various groups, it's at least taken more seriously now. Various indies have long blazed a trail for curating better communities, and even massive companies like EA (with its Positive Play charter) and Microsoft (with its accessibility push) have realized that a bigger tent for gaming is a better tent -- or more profitable, at least -- and the most caustic corners of our audiences have been holding that back.There's a lot of rotten news out there, but there's reason to hope these are necessary (if long overdue) growing pains for an immature industry. I don't see how we can go from the industry that was to something better without a whole lot of bad news along the way.## The rest of the week in review **STAT** | 44% - The percentage of Paradox Interactive employees who reported experiencing mistreatment at the company, according to a survey conducted by Swedish union groups Unionen and Sveriges Ingenjorer. **QUOTE** | \"In this time that we've very visibly fended off this cohort of trolls, their stance is that, 'You're killing your sales by doing this. We're the gamers and you're keeping us out.' The reality is that our baseline sales since that time, through that whole turmoil, have more than doubled, which is extremely material to us.\" - Caves of Qud developer Brian Bucklew says the game's tightly controlled Discord community has resulted in financial and community benefits that far outweigh the backlash. **QUOTE** | \"If we're all happier to be at work because we're well-rested, I think we're going to be better off in the long run.\" - Phil Tibitoski of Bugsnax developer Young Horses explains the reasoning behind the studio's shift to a four-day work week. It made the change in July and hasn't noticed any change to productivity. **QUOTE** | \"We realized that working from home is a work mode that is more suitable for some people, as it offers a work-life balance adapted to their needs.\" Dontnod HR director Matthieu Hoffman on the company's decision allowing all employees to choose between working in the office or remotely. **QUOTE** | \"Currently, as it stands, the creative team at Ubisoft is composed of white people who are of uniform cultural backgrounds. This leaves us with a lack of confidence in the future shape of the editorial team.\" - Employee group A Better Ubisoft responds to the promotion of long-time Ubisoft employee Igor Manceau to be chief creative officer. Manceau replaces Serge Hascoet, who left the company last year after reported naming him as a central figure in sexual harassment and discrimination claims at the company. **STAT** | 24% - Percentage of Riot's global employees in 2020 who were women, according to the company's latest diversity update. That figure is up 2% from 2019. **QUOTE** | \"If you're a bunch of white guys and one woman, some people might be cautious about [being] the first person of [their identity] because they don't know what to expect... If you haven't been paying attention and you grow to 20, 50, 100, you are going to have a harder sell in a lot of ways.\" - Poorly Timed Games founder Chris Wright emphasizes that diverse candidates are a lot easier to attract if you care about diversity from the start. **QUOTE** | \"Proud of #USSupremeCourt affirming the Texas law banning abortion for babies with a heartbeat. As an entertainer I don't get political often. Yet with so many vocal peers on the other side of this issue, I felt it was important to go on the record as a pro-life game developer.\" - Tripwire Interactive president John Gibson, posting on Twitter Saturday afternoon. **QUOTE** | \"We started Shipwright with the idea that it was finally time to put our money where our mouth is. We cannot in good conscience continue to work with Tripwire under the current leadership structure. We will begin the cancellation of our existing contracts effective immediately.\" - Tripwire co-development partner Shipwright Studios, responding to Gibson's tweet on Sunday afternoon. **QUOTE** | \"We do not share the opinion expressed in a recent tweet by the president of Tripwire, publisher of Chivalry 2. This perspective is not shared by our team, nor is it reflected in the games we create. The statement stands in opposition to what we believe about women's rights.\" - Chivalry 2 developer Torn Banner Studios distances itself from Gibson's comments on Sunday night. **QUOTE** | \"His comments disregarded the values of our whole team, our partners and much of our broader community. Our leadership team at Tripwire are deeply sorry and are unified in our commitment to take swift action and to foster a more positive environment.\" - Tripwire Interactive, in a statement announcing Gibson's resignation Monday night. **QUOTE** | \"To work with people that go as far back as Wipeout... the entire leadership team we have worked with in the past. Graeme Ankers, Stuart Tilley, Dr Lovegrove... I've worked directly with them on projects, on Killzone 2. That legacy of the old Studio Liverpool with Formula 1... it's a really great feeling to welcome them back to the family.\" - PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst talks about how highly Sony thinks of the people behind its new acquisition Firesprite. **QUOTE** | \"It was felt that by focusing our investment plans on other Studios that are currently working on exciting new projects, we would be in a stronger position to offer the best possible content for our consumers.\" - Sony, in 2012, explaining why it was closing Studio Liverpool and kicking Ankers, Tilley, and Lovegrove out of \"the family\" in the process. **STAT** | 1 year - The minimum amount of time remaining until the worldwide semiconductor shortage starts to ease, according to Toshiba. Good luck meeting demand until then, console makers!**QUOTE** | \"It's abundantly clear that the offerings we confirmed in [Horizon Forbidden West's] pre-order kickoff missed the mark.\" - Sony Interactive Entertainment's president and CEO Jim Ryan resorts to the dreaded \"missed the mark\" euphemism for explaining why the company was going to charge an extra $10 to upgrade the PS4 version of Forbidden West to the PS5 edition, even though it had specifically told people the upgrade would be free. Turns out charging people for things you previously told them would be free will indeed \"miss the mark\" more often than not.Making the games industry a better place to workFind out more__Sign up for The Publishing & Retail newsletter and get the best of GamesIndustry.biz in your inbox.Enter your email addressCEO Fredrik Wester says he has been working to better himself, will not be directly involved in handling related issuesBy Brendan Sinclair __17 hours ago## Apple refuses to reinstate Epic's developer account in South Korea\"We would welcome Epic's return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else,\" Apple saidBy Marie DealessandriUK PR Executive (Entry Level)Senior UI/UX Designer \u2013 Mobile Games \u2013 Fully remoteJunior / Experienced Programmer __Second Impact GamesDiscover more jobs in games __There are no comments on this article yet.

Face masks are the leading segment in the anti-viral fabric adoption rate during the forecast years, 2021-2026. Face masks account for the global total addressable market of $73.50 billion in 2020.Copper ion, silver ions, and various other chemicals were being tested for effectively killing the COVID-19 virus on the fabric within some hours of exposure. Several companies have developed new technologies which claim to kill the COVID-19 virus up to 99.9% within the time frame of thirty minutes to two hours.Several companies have been a success and have patented their technologies, passing all the tests and checks conducted by regulatory and health bodies of regions and countries.Some of the key companies involved in developing anti-viral technology fabrics are HeiQ Materials AG, Polygiene, Rudolf GmbH, and HealthGaurd Corporation Pty. Ltd.The anti-viral fabric market has been segmented based on products, namely, face masks, bed linen and spreads, PPE, bath/toilet linen, kitchen linen, upholstery, and flooring linen.

Paradox Interactive is a Sweden-based publisher of video games like _Crusader Kings III_ and _Cities: Skylines_. Ljungerud's departure apparently comes \"due to differing views on the company's strategy going forward.\" Ljungerud has been the CEO of the company since 2018, when she replaced Fredrik Wester. Wester continued to serve as the executive chairman of the board, and will now step back into the role he previously served in for 10 years. Board chairman Hakan Sjunnesson spoke highly of Ljungerud's tenure as CEO.\"Ebba has done a fantastic job as CEO of Paradox Interactive. During her leadership the organisation, player base and our game projects have been strengthened and grown which give the company a strong base for future growth. We regret that she has decided to resign but wish her all the best in future endeavours,\" Sjunnesson said in the press release.On Twitter, Ljungerud addressed her departure, and seemed to have nothing but well wishes for Paradox Interactive in the future. She also addressed one fan's concerns, stating that \"the company is in very safe and good hands.\"> What a ride it has been \u2764\ufe0f but now it is over and the CEO torch goes back to Fred. Thanks to @TheWesterFront @PdxInteractive and all of our amazing players for these years, I look forward to new great things to come for the games and the company!> -- ebba ljungerud (@ebbalj) September 1, 2021Unfortunately, it's difficult to say what the future might hold for Ljungerud, as well as Paradox Interactive! Wester's history with Paradox Interactive and Ljungerud's statements should help to ease any concerns about whatever direction the publisher is moving towards. Shake-ups are not uncommon in the video game industry, and it's possible that the board's vision for the future simply didn't fit with Ljungerud's. Hopefully, this change will be a beneficial one for the company and for the fans, moving forward.Are you a fan of Paradox Interactive's games?

The definition of mistreatment in this context has not yet been publicly laid out.As per Breakit, 44% of the 133 people who took part in the survey answered to say that they had experienced mistreatment at Paradox. The report states that while women made up only around a quarter of respondents, 69% of female employees who took part said that they had experienced abusive treatment during their tenure. Meanwhile, around a third of male employees also said that they had experienced mistreatment.According to Breakit, the union concluded the report by saying, \"Offensive treatment is a systematic and far too common problem at Paradox.\" The article goes on to say that employees at the company feel that there is a \"culture of silence\" at the publisher, and very few employees who had experienced abusive treatment felt as though the issue had been handled and solved appropriately at a later stage.Following the news, Paradox issued a statement to Eurogamer in which it acknowledged that it was \"aware of a survey undertaken inside the company\" and that the results of the said survey were \"obviously not satisfactory\". The full statement can be read as follows:_\" We are aware of a survey undertaken inside the company on this topic, and of the results, which are obviously not satisfactory. The management team wants to ensure this data is acted upon, but taking immediate, direct action is legally difficult thanks to the informal nature of the survey (and thanks to the results being shared just before we underwent this CEO change, which has been fairly busy for us). We are currently working to reconcile the informal survey with our own internal research, and are eager to take action._ _\" Paradox is now in the process of bringing in an external, neutral firm to conduct a thorough audit of our processes and a comprehensive employee survey. This will help us advance our efforts towards all of the subjects that we've worked to improve in recent years - harassment and abuse will be paramount among these, but we'll also be examining subjects like unbiased hiring and compensation, ongoing bias awareness, inclusion, and more.\"_News of the report comes only days after Paradox CEO Ebba Ljungerud stepped down from the company. Her resignation, Paradox said at the time, came due to differing opinions in company strategy going forward. Despite the short time between the two events, the publisher's communications department, Ljungerud herself, and the company's new CEO Frederik Wester all reportedly deny that there is a connection between the two events.The reported mistreatment of employees at Paradox is the latest in a series of similar cases to affect the industry. Earlier this year, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a lawsuit against Activision Blizzard with allegations surrounding gender discrimination and a \"frat boy\" culture at the company. The same agency has also been investigating the results of a gender discrimination lawsuit at Riot Games whilst Ubisoft Singapore has been under scrutiny as reports surfaced that it was being looked into by the country's national watchdog for harassment claims._Jared Moore is a freelance writer for IGN.

Read our editorial policy.#  Union survey alleges culture of mistreatment at Paradox InteractiveRespondents claim to have experienced bullying and gender discriminationNews  by Imogen Beckhelling News WriterPublished on  6 Sep, 2021An internal survey conducted by Paradox Interactive's unions has revealed an alleged culture of mistreatment at the company, who're known for developing grand strategy games such as Crusader Kings. Of the 133 Paradox employees who responded to the survey, 44% claimed to have experienced mistreatment, from bullying to gender discrimination.This comes from a leaked document made public by the Swedish tech website Breakit, though RPS have seen a copy of the results summary, and a union representative has verified the document's authenticity for us.The survey was conducted last month by Unionen and SACO, the two main unions at Paradox Interactive, concerning the working conditions in the Swedish part of the business. The results claim that 69% of women and 33% of respondents had experienced mistreatment during their time at the company.It further claims that \"mistreatment is a systemic and far too common issue at Paradox\", and that \"high-level perpetrators are perceived as shielded by the company\", creating a \"culture of silence\".While the survey results paint an unsavoury picture of the working conditions at Paradox, it's worth noting that this wasn't a huge legal investigation into the company's culture, but something organised by union reps. A representative of Unionen and SACO told us over email that the survey was only sent to union members and Paradox staff in their union Slack channel. It's also difficult to pinpoint when the alleged mistreatment took place, because the survey was about staff members' general time at Paradox.Nevertheless, the results of the survey do justify further investigation, and it seems that's the next step for the company. The union rep informed us that, while it hasn't been announced internally, Paradox are planning a \"third party audit of some sort\", which they had specifically suggested to HR when they presented them with the results.\"As union members, we believe this to be a good idea as long as we're involved in the process,\" they told us. \"We believe our involvement is necessary to ensure our members can trust the results, the interpretation of the results, and the choice of questions.\"A Paradox Interactive spokesperson told us: \"The management team has been working to reconcile the informal survey with our own internal research, and are eager to take action. Paradox is now in the process of bringing in an external, neutral firm to conduct a thorough audit of our processes and a comprehensive employee survey.\"\"This will help us advance our efforts towards all of the subjects that we've worked to improve in recent years - harassment and abuse will be paramount among these, but we'll also be examining subjects like unbiased hiring and compensation, ongoing bias awareness, inclusion, and more,\" they added.This has come out at a strange time for Paradox. Last week, the company's CEO Ebba Ljungerud stepped down, with former CEO Fredrik Wester stepping in to take up his old role again. The union rep told us that the survey and Ljungerud's departure are unrelated however, and they have no reason to believe there's any connection.It also comes a year after our own investigation into Paradox's working conditions, in which current and former staff alleged poor treatment, low pay, and mismanaged layoffs.  * Paradox Interactive Imogen is a lore enthusiast and lover of all the fun shenanigans game communities get up to.

The subject in this latest case is Cities: Skylines and Crusader Kings publisher Paradox Interactive, which was recently the subject of an eye-opening Swedish union survey.Of the 133 employees who chose to participate in the survey (the company has around 400 employees total in Sweden) 44 percent reported \u201cmistreatment\u201d of some kind. This was worse for female employees, with 69 percent reporting some sort of abuse. Various forms of bullying and gender discrimination are said to be the main source of the complaints. As is often the case in these scenarios, those affected feel there\u2019s a culture of silence around the toxic behavior, with \u201calmost no one\u201d with complaints feeling they were adequately addressed by Paradox.Crusader Kings III Confirmed for Xbox Series X/S and PS5, is Being Adapted for ControllersNow, there could have been some element of self-selection bias going on here \u2013 employees that felt they\u2019d been mistreated may have been more likely to participate in the survey, skewing the numbers somewhat. That said, these are still revelations to be taken seriously, particularly the fact that employees feel their concerns aren\u2019t being addressed properly by the company. In a statement sent to Kotaku, Paradox says they plan to run a more comprehensive survey and an audit of their HR practices\u2026> Obviously, the results of this survey are deeply concerning. The management team wants to ensure this data is acted upon, but taking immediate, direct action is legally difficult thanks to the informal nature of the survey (which is not to say it\u2019s being dismissed out-of-hand by any means).> We decided last week to have an independent company run an audit of our processes to report and handle cases of discrimination and harassment. We\u2019ll also have them run a comprehensive survey to provide us with clearly defined and actionable data that we can use to make impactful change.This latest news comes only days after the resignation of Paradox CEO Ebba Ljungerud, due to \u201cdiffering views on the company\u2019s strategy going forward.\u201d While the timing may seem suspect, Paradox insists Ljungerud\u2019s departure and results of the recent survey are unrelated.In addition to continuing to support games like Crusader Kings III and Cities: Skylines, Paradox recently announced the much-anticipated Victoria 3.__Share __Tweet __Submit### The Meme Finally Becomes Reality - Victoria 3 AnnouncedChris Wray  \u2022  May 21, 2021### Crusader Kings III's Reveals First Major Expansion - Royal CourtChris Wray  \u2022  May 21, 2021### Empire of Sin Makes it Count with a Major Expansion & Free DLCChris Wray  \u2022  May 21, 2021### Crusader Kings III's \u201cNorthern Lords\" DLC is Valhalla for Viking Fans, at a PriceNathan Birch  \u2022  Mar 21, 2021### Crusader Kings III is Free to Play on Steam for the Rest of This WeekNathan Birch  \u2022  Mar 16, 2021Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.  * NVIDIA Responds to GeForce NOW Database Leak, Says List Included 'Speculative Titles'  * ASUS Z690 Motherboard Lineup Leaks Out - ROG Maximus XIV, ROG STRIX, TUF Gaming & PRIME Series  * Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake Desktop CPUs Listed By US Retailer With Preliminary Prices For Both Boxed & Tray Variants  * Minisforum Responds to EliteMini HX90 Mini PC Liquid Metal Mishap, Says They Sent The Wrong Samples To Reviewers  * Cyberpunk 2077 Patch 1.31 Improves Wet Surfaces System, GPU Memory Optimization on PlayStation Consoles and More  * MSI Rolls Out AMD AGESA 1.2.0.4 BIOS Firmware To Even More X570, B550, X470, B450 & A520 Motherboards3607  * AMD Ryzen 5000 Series CPUs Are Receiving Price Cuts Across The Board Ahead Of The Intel Alder Lake-S Launch2437  * NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 12 GB Graphics Card Reportedly Launches In Q1 2022 To Tackle GPU Availability Issues1437  * AMD Mining Card With RDNA 2 Navi 22 GPU Spotted, Features 10 GB GDDR6 Memory With 39 MH/s1361  * Intel's Next-Gen Box CPU Cooler 'Laminar Series' For 12th Gen Alder Lake Desktop CPUs Pictured, Updated Spiral Fin Design With LEDs1321  * #### Prima 1080p HD Pocket Projector Is Up For A Great Price Drop Offer This Week  * #### Boost Mobile Samsung Galaxy A32 5G + Free 1-Month Unlimited Talk, Text & 5GB 5G/4G Data Is Up For A Massive Offer - Avail Now  * #### Dragon Mechanical Gaming Keyboard & Mouse Set Is Up For A 50% Discount Offer This Week - Avail Now  * #### Learn Smart Lifetime Subscription Bundle ft. 12 min Micro Book Library & Apple Airpods Pro Is Up For An Amazing Offer  * #### Beginner\u2019s Guide to Game Development Bundle Is Up For A Massive Discount Offer - Avail Now  * Change Ad Consent Do not sell my dataFor latest tech news in your inbox, once a day!Wccftech (C) 2021 WCCF TECH INC.

They store and process vast amounts of data in the blink of an eye, translate language instantaneously, and even operate machinery. But they have the same emotional intelligence as a brick wall.Egyptian-American computer scientist Rana el Kaliouby wants to change that.The 43-year-old co-founded her company Affectiva while undertaking a Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Specializing in \"Emotion AI,\" a subsect of artificial intelligence, Kaliouby wants to teach computers how to recognize and quantify human emotions.Technology has created an \"empathy crisis,\" Kaliouby says -- and her mission is to humanize it.One of the early applications of Emotion AI that Kaliouby explored was tech-enabled glasses to help children with autism read facial expressions. The glasses offered prompts to the wearer, telling them how to respond to various non-verbal cues like smiling or frowning. \"We started to see a lot of really positive improvements in these kids; it was just really powerful,\" says Kaliouby. After years of research and development, the technology was officially launched in 2017 for integration into smart glasses such as Google Glass.Technology has always been a part of Kaliouby's life. Born in Egypt, her parents were both computer programmers, and she studied computer science at the American University in Cairo before co-founding Affectiva in 2009 with Rosalind Picard.The company has grown from a university spin-out into an international, multi-million dollar enterprise with headquarters in Boston. But Kaliouby maintains close ties with Egypt, and Affectiva employs about 60 people at its Cairo office, including software engineers and machine learning scientists.Affectiva's emotion-reading AI software is being applied to driver monitoring systems, to detect drowsiness.One area where Kaliouby believes Emotion AI could have life-saving applications is the automotive industry, where driver monitoring systems that use AI-powered cameras in cars could potentially detect driver distraction and drowsiness, preventing accidents.In May 2021, Affectiva was acquired by Smart Eye, a leader in eye-tracking technology for driver monitoring, and the two companies are now combining their technologies.According to the European Commission, 90% of road accidents are down to human error -- one reason the EU has introduced new regulations for all European vehicles to include this kind of technology by 2022, and legislation is being considered in the US. Car manufacturers such as Tesla and General Motors have incorporated driver monitoring tech into some of their vehicles, and Affectiva is already working with big automotive brands including BMW, Porsche and Hyundai.There are other applications for cars too, says Kaliouby, including cameras that can view the full cabin to customize the driving experience. \"If my baby in the backseat is falling asleep, it can dim the lights, or stop the music; it could change the temperature,\" she says. \"You can personalize the car based on who's in it, what they're doing, and how they're feeling.\"Co-founded by Rana el Kaliouby (pictured) and Rosalind Picard, Affectiva has offices in Boston, US, and Cairo, Egypt.But using Emotion AI to monitor people can be controversial. Racial and gender bias is a recurring issue, along with privacy concerns. This year, Brazilian metro operator ViaQuatro was fined 100,000 Brazilian reals ($20,000) for capturing facial recognition data without users' consent. ViaQuatro had installed an emotion-detecting camera system on the S\u00e3o Paulo Metro in 2018 to monitor people's reactions to advertisements. The company claims the system did not carry out facial recognition, and complied with data protection legislation.Even theoretically \"positive\" uses could have more sinister consequences, says Vidushi Marda, an AI researcher, policy advisor and lawyer at Article 19, a human rights organization that defends freedom of expression. For example, driver monitoring systems could double as workplace surveillance for truck or taxi drivers, she says, adding that regardless of the intended use, Emotion AI is \"surveillance enabling.\" Marda says there is \"no easy way to mitigate\" the harmful uses of Emotion AI.Some scientists even dispute the effectiveness of using AI to read emotions. A 2019 meta-study of more than 1,000 research papers found insufficient evidence to support the concept of \"universal facial expressions,\" and according to a 2020 study, emotion-recognition AI can be less accurate than humans.Aware of the many concerns surrounding Emotion AI, Kaliouby says Affectiva has a strict opt-in policy for data collection and transparency around how data is being used and stored.\"Anywhere where people's data privacy considerations are not respected, we're not going to do,\" says Kaliouby, adding that the company turns down those wanting to use the software for surveillance, security or lie detection.With 11 million facial responses from 90 countries around the world, Kaliouby says Affectiva is trying to create a diverse database that removes age, gender and racial biases from its system. Affectiva is working on a model which includes facial expression and tone of voice, and accounts for nuances such as culture and context.In the years to come, Kaliouby hopes Emotion AI can help create a more human, empathetic digital experience.\"The mission is to transform what a human-machine interface looks like, because that's not going to just improve our interactions with technology, but it's going to make our own connections with each other in a digital world so much better,\" she says.\u00a9 2021 Cable News Network.A Warner Media Company.All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans \u2122 & \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network."}

The lifestyle blogger is a big advocate of women carving their own path. And for Rankins, world travel is a huge part of her own journey. This year, she took her love of travel and creativity to new heights, entering and winning IHG Hotels & Resorts\u2019 EPIC giveaway, which gifted her with 365 days' worth of hotel rooms around the world and lifetime IHG Rewards Spire Elite status.Get to know Sherita and what her plans are for this win of a lifetime!### **What made you want to enter IHG\u2019s Epic Vacation giveaway?**I'm a true travel fanatic. I'm always looking for travel deals online even if I don't have any trips planned. So, it was my husband who actually shared this giveaway with me. He said this is perfect and right up my alley. And when I saw what it was it just seemed like the chance of a lifetime. I mean, who gives away 365 days of hotel stays?!### **What was the inspiration behind your video submissions?**The first video I shot \u2013 that was me saying, let me show you how pitiful I am right now. The opening scene summed up 2020 \u2013 and to be honest I still live in that robe. I thought \u2013 how I can get myself back into a travel mode and show IHG how much I want this!After I posted it, I saw that people were submitting multiple videos. With the second one, I thought \u2013 I need to really create something here. What if I made a video taking my _\u201crobe life\u201d_ into what this vacation would look like? I was inspired by Cinderella \u2013 doing all the work around the house and decided that a pool transition would really make this video stand out. My husband was the guinea pig and the night before, he kept falling into the pool so we could get that transition just right. By the time I did it the next day, I was able to use the very first take!### **What IHG hotels and destinations are you most excited to visit?**Oh my god \u2013 so many! This is a loaded question, there are so many options I started a spread sheet. I want to go to Dubai, to the Maldives, South America, the new InterContinental in Rome, and the Kimpton Seafire in the Cayman Islands looks amazing. I just found a property in South Africa that does safaris, I\u2019m trying to hit as many places as possible.### **What do you hope to learn and share from this experience?**My whole brand is about helping women live their best lives. I approach life in a holistic way, and I hope my travel inspires others to go out and try whatever they have always wanted to do. People often tell me that they live vicariously through me, and they don\u2019t have to! You can do this \u2013 I want women to feel empowered when I share my experiences and know that it\u2019s okay to do something for of themselves.For myself, every trip leaves me a little more open, a little more empathetic. Traveling really does open minds and hearts.### **Who will you take with you on some of your trips to IHG properties?**My husband is the quintessential travel partner, and he is my photographer and is always up for an adventure. My mom and I love to take spa trips, so one of those will be planned.My dear friends who I know haven't had a chance to travel \u2013 I'm definitely going to reach out to them for some girls' trips.### **What are some things you have learned from your travels?**When I travel, I think about how I can immerse myself in the culture as much as I can while still being respectful. I try to have an open mind and I\u2019ve found that no matter where you are, you can find ways to connect with people. One thing for me is that I try to use the native language as much as possible even if I can't speak a lot of it. I'll learn a few phrases such as good morning, please, thank you and you\u2019re welcome. When you can at least say thank you, it goes a long way, and it shows respect.### **What do you love about hotels?**Oh man \u2013 everything. The welcoming feeling, a suite with a sunken bath, and crisp sheets. I find when I check into a hotel it can be a magical experience and getting a hotel upgrade is the icing on the cake. A great hotel allows you to rest and recharge, so you can wake up excited to experience your destination and the adventures that await you.### **Name a few things you absolutely can't travel without.**Silk Eye Mask. I wear it on planes and at hotels while sleeping.DSLR camera and laptopBug spray + cortisoneSkincare + makeup is a must### **How can people follow your journey?**On Instagram @sheritajanielle and my website, BusyWifeBusyLife.com. I will be creating travel guides for many of the destinations!Click here learn more about IHG Hotels & Resorts and to become an IHG Rewards member.IHG Hotels & Resorts is a global organisation with a broad portfolio of hotel brands, including Six Senses Hotels Resorts Spas, Regent Hotels & Resorts, InterContinental\u00ae Hotels & Resorts, Kimpton\u00ae Hotels & Restaurants, Hotel Indigo\u00ae, EVEN Hotels \u00ae, HUALUXE\u00ae Hotels and Resorts, Crowne Plaza\u00ae Hotels & Resorts, voco\u2122, Holiday Inn\u00ae Hotels & Resorts, Holiday Inn Express\u00ae, Holiday Inn Club Vacations\u00ae, avid\u2122 hotels, Staybridge Suites\u00ae, Atwell Suites\u2122 and Candlewood Suites\u00ae.IHG franchises, leases, manages or owns nearly 5,800 hotels and approximately 865,000 guest rooms in more than 100 countries, with over 1,900 hotels in its development pipeline.

Oltre al proprio stile di conducente, si potranno prendere anche quelli di piloti professionisti, acquistandoli on line08 Settembre 2021 3 minuti di lettura|  |  |  |**ROMA** \\- Creata dall'ingegner Luigi Mazzola (ex Ferrari), si tratta di una startup innovativa che sta sviluppando un sistema in grado di registrare lo stile di guida del conducente e di farlo riprodurre sulle auto a guida autonoma. Le auto senza conducente potranno correre con lo stile del proprietario o di una pilota professionista, scegliendolo tra il catalogo dei profili registrati. Si potranno, condividere, scaricare o acquistare on line i profili di guida dei propri idoli.Il sistema si appoggia alle seguenti dotazioni hardware e software gia normalmente presenti su veicoli con differenti livelli di guida assistita o autonoma e li va ad integrare. Sensori di angolo di sterzo, di coppia applicata allo sterzo, di velocita di sterzata, di azione sui pedali di acceleratore e freno, di angoli di imbardata, rollio e beccheggio, di accelerazione laterale e longitudinale. Ai sensori si aggiunge il software di elaborazione dei segnali visivi, sonar e radar che permette a questi veicoli di comprendere la situazione ambientale circostante. Attraverso la registrazione dei dati effettuata su questi sensori, viene profilato uno stile di guida. Il guidatore del mezzo a guida autonoma o semi autonoma potra successivamente impostare questo profilo di guida. La startup basa la sua scommessa sul fatto che il futuro delle auto sara a guida autonoma. Entro 10 anni i mezzi guidati da intelligenza artificiale arriveranno ad essere diffusi in tutto il mondo. Stando ad unostudio condotto dalla societa internazionale di consulenza McKinsey & Company, nel 2030 il 15% delle nuove immatricolazioni sara rappresentato da auto a guida autonoma e il 55% da vetture a guida semi autonoma. Secondo lo studio, nel 2030 vi saranno complessivamente 200 milioni di auto autonome o semi autonome circolanti nel mondo. In questo quadro si inserisce appunto il progetto \"Social Self Driving\", Startup innovativa completamente italiana nata da un'intuizione dell'ingegner Luigi Mazzola (dopo 20 anni nella scuderia Ferrari con 14 mondiali vinti, Mazzola ora e imprenditore, executive coach e trainer aziendale) e dei suoi due co-fondatori, che iniziera nelle prossime settimane il primo round di finanziamento e lo sviluppo del progetto, forte anche di un brevetto di cui e licenziataria esclusiva. Si tratta di un sistema di registrazione e profilazione dello stile di guida del conducente di un veicolo, che consente di replicarlo successivamente, impostandolo come stile di guida daeseguire per un mezzo a guida autonoma o semi autonoma. In pratica su di un'auto a guida autonoma si potra impostare un profilo corrispondente ad uno stile di guida personalizzato, potendolo anche condividere con altri utenti attraverso un'apposita piattaforma cloud. Il sistema e in grado di apprendere lo stile di guida del proprietario. Ad esempio, il suo modo di affrontare le curve, il suo modo di posizionarsi sulla carreggiata, la gestione del cambio marce e similari. Questi aspetti vengono registrati e il software e in grado di memorizzarli. Lo stile di guida, una volta memorizzato, viene profilato e potra essere poi replicato, ovvero impostato come stile di guida nel mezzo a conduzione autonoma e semiautonoma. Mezzo che dunque procedera seguendo lo stile del guidatore. Insomma, con questo sistema ci sara la possibilita di far apprendere al proprio veicolo lo stile di guida dell'utilizzatore e di farglielo replicare.Non finisce qui. La novita di questo progetto e che gli stili di guida memorizzati nel software potranno essere poi condivisibili all'esterno, permettendo di renderli utilizzabili da altri utenti su altri mezzi dotati dell'app \"Social Self Driving\". Sara dunque possibile creare un marketplace (un negozio virtuale) in cui case automobilistiche, piloti professionisti, istruttori di guida sicura, automobilisti esperti e personaggi pubblici possono commercializzare i propri programmi di guida personalizzati, i propri profili di guida.\"Con Social Self Driving possiamo personalizzare la nostra auto a guida autonoma ed insegnarle a comportarsi come se alla guida ci fossimo noi.

On this episode of _Rule Breaker Investing_ _: Mailbag_ , we hear a lot of love for Coach Reich, we get a little more airtime with our VC side swami Ollen, and we round it off with some stories that remind us of what is truly important in life.To catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out our podcast center. To get started investing, check out our quick-start guide to investing in stocks. A full transcript follows the video._This video was recorded on July 27, 2021._**David Gardner:** It started with three reviews of past five stock samplers, _Five Stocks For America, Five Stocks That Pass The Snap Test_. _Five Stocks --_ four years later -- _Celebrating the 2018 World Cup_. Spoiler alert, all three of those samplers are beating the market with those 15 stocks together, averaging beating the market by more than 30%, so eat your hearts out, Bogleheads. Well, from stocks we went to the National Football League. In week two, we learned from Frank Reich, one of the great coaches in sports today, who generously and also Foolishly shared his amazing life story and lessons, including the three key moments that make him the foolish investor he is today. Then from stock-picking and life lessons, we transitioned in week three to venture capital investing and I had my pal, Ollen Douglass, to demystify VC investing for you and convey even more lessons that will help out all of my fellow _Rule Breakers_. Now here we are, it's the final week of July, andtherefore, it is your mailbag. Based on the feedback this month, it seems to be in particular, you'd like to get even smarter about venture capital investing in particular. Let's do it. Only on this week's _Rule Breaker investing_.Welcome back to _Rule Breaker Investing_ , a delight to have you with me this week. Thank you for making some extra time. I feel like we took up a lot of your time this particular month because two of my longest podcasts in _Rule Breaker Investing_ history occurred this month. In fact, they were the previous two podcasts. I was enjoying Frank Reich so much that I just kept going and let it run long and I hope it didn't feel long to you. Sure, sure, it didn't feel long to me and of course, my longtime producer, Rick Engdahl, he is the one with the hatchet. So if he feels like it's too long, stuff starts to disappear and I think Rick left almost all of that in. It's a delight to learn so much from Frank Reich. I'll be sharing some of the feedback I got with you very shortly. But then last week we also went long, an hour-and-a-half on venture capital investing. As it turns out, we couldn't possibly cover all of the corners or angles that we'd want to. I got a bunch of questions back.Ollen Douglass is going to rejoin me this week and we're going to answer some of your really thoughtful questions about this form of investing. That will be a big part of this week's mailbag.Now, before I get started with some hot takes from Twitter, I want to mention a few things I do from time to time. How to write something to get you on the mailbag. Although actually, I'm going to be looking at the other side of the coin and just reminding some of my longtime listeners a few of the what I would call ground rules around the mailbag. I received and these are always flattering a number of applications. I would describe this as people who would like a job at either The Motley Fool or The Motley Fool Foundation. These are lovely notes and very flattering, but I'm not going to share that probably on the mailbag and those are better addressed to our hiring department. You can go to careers.fool.com to see any of our openings. Often, there is a great story that's being told along with that application. That kind of sounds like it could be a mailbag, but really that is much better directed to our hiring team here at The Motley Fool. Another example of notes that don't make itonto the mailbag, amazing, but too long notes and you may know who you are at this week, Bradley Larson, that was an amazing note, but it's just too long for me to share within this format. Yes, I love hearing your stories, whoever you are, your investing stories, your business and life stories, how you connect with The Motley Fool, those will always be of enduring interest, not just to me I think, but to many people listening. But if it takes four or five pages to write out, chances are it's not going to make the mailbag. It hurts, because a lot of effort was put into such a long note. Yet, along with Mark Twain, sometimes you have to spend extra time to make it shorter, and that is advisable if you want to appear on the mailbag.Then, one more example of something that's just not going to quite make the mailbag. We've got a great note in the past month from somebody who is giving a big gift to his high school. The high school he graduated from decades ago, and it's in order to start as an investment club. But the request was basically how he should structure that to make it work best for his high school. Now, that is a really lovely question, but that's not something that really fits on the mailbag here. Especially if you're designing something on your own or it's part of your wills and estates, probably that doesn't quite fit the _Rule Breaker Investing_ mailbag. Again, I appreciate all the notes and I read them all, but I can't feature so many of them. The ones I do feature usually fit more with some form of storytelling or questions of broad interest, where a lot of people are listening, will be sitting on the edge of their seats wondering what the answer is to that question. You all know this. It takes youto make this mailbag happen. I want to thank each of you for more than 35 pages of notes this past month, always making my job hard to figure out what we should feature on the _Rule Breaker Investing_ mailbag.Let's go to some hot takes from Twitter. A lot of these reacting in particular to Frank Reich. I want to read several of these. Jay Shah, you said, \"I listened to every single _Rule Breaker Investing_ podcast by @DavidGFool, but this one, in particular, is so good. I'm a huge fan of Frank Reich from his time with the Eagles. This podcast will teach you not only about good investing but also about good life lessons.\" Jammy@Jammy_ [...] with a three, that's leet speak well done, Jammy. \"What may seem a great spontaneity comes from discipline and practice. Great new perspective many more life lessons learned this week from the _Rule Breaker Investing_ podcasts. Thank you Frank, and thank you David and Rick for another great episode. \" Jason Moore, \"This is one of my favorite episodes of the year. The level of accomplishment Coach Reich has achieved across so many platforms is incredible. Mix that in with a modest upbringing and a humble attitude toward success, well, every corner of thispodcast has a new lesson to learn, and that's just how it felt to me as well.\" Thank you, Jason.Finally, savior of humanity, Adam Nelson writes in, \"Punning, smarter, happier, Reich with a smiley. Great interview, thoroughly enjoyed it.\" Adam says, \"I will be drafting Carson Wentz in my fantasy football league, betting on good management to help him reach new heights.\" Thanks again. Well, thank you, Adam, and thank you all for the outpouring of support and interest that came from our interview with Frank Reich. Now that wasn't all that Twitter was full up, we did get a number of nice notes about my friend Ollen Douglass' appearance last week. One representative one from Neeraj Kapoor @Cricket99238 on Twitter @DavidGFool. \"Absolutely amazing episodes on the insights into the workings of venture capitalists greatly enjoyed the anecdotes and wisdom shared on the podcast. Thanks for putting this little gem together.\" Well, I couldn't have put that little gem together if I didn't have the head of Motley Fool Ventures as my sidekick and actually not my sidekick really the swami atwhose feet we were all sitting. Speaking of swami, why not have Ollen Douglass back again? Because Ollen, I got a lot of great reactions and some more questions and some really good questions, a motley variety. I thought you and I should kick it around some of this week.**Ollen Douglass:** Very good, David, I'm very happy to be back. Can I be your side swami?**Gardner:** That I'm pretty sure side swami, that sounds great to me Ollen. In fact, I'm thinking maybe that phrase hasn't been used very much in all of history. Why not? I just Googled side swami and the top hit is for Albert Einstein and it says Albert Einstein, this is from an Amazon book, _His Human Side_ , colon swami, and then it goes on from there. So side swami, yes, those words occurred together but they weren't even intended to be together. They are an Albert Einstein book title. All right, Ollen, welcome back. In fact, I have queued up the first four _Rule Breaker Investing_ mailbag items for you this week sir, so you're going to do some extra work. I bet you weren't planning on this when we spent 90 minutes last week talking about all of this. You probably thought you said enough.**Douglass:** No, this is going to be fun David, I'm looking forward to the questions.**Gardner:** I am as well and thank you, Ollen. The first one comes from Eugene Inc. He is writing in from Singapore multiple mail bag appearances for Eugene, really nice note Eugene, let's go through it here. Hi David. Hello again, I am Eugene Inc from Singapore, and it was truly insightful and refreshing to have Ollen Douglass on your latest _RBI_ podcast to talk about venture capital. In addition to being a longtime Fool and a big fan of you, the _Rule Breaker Investing_ podcast, which I listen to every week without fail, and The Motley Fool, I recently started angel and early stage investing in private start-ups as well over the last year. Got a couple of questions for Ollen. If you'd be willing to invite him back in less than seven years of course. Making a joke about what we said last week. Thank you, Eugene. Ollen, you're back seven days later.**Gardner:** He has three questions. Let's take them one at a time, Ollen. Here is the first one. What were the reasons and considerations for Motley Fool Ventures choosing and specializing in Series A? Eugene wonders why not earlier? Why not like seed investing or pre-seed, or why not later stages like bigger money VC near IPO. Let me pause it there, he's got a little bit more there, but what was your reasoning for Series A, Ollen?**Douglass:** David, our first stop by just for those listeners who aren't engrossed in venture capital, all those letters or seed in Series A, are basically the stages of a company and they tend to signify, even though the numbers may move around, they tend to signify a certain stage of development for a company, and that blends right into its answer. We picked Series A because that's usually the point where companies and start-ups are tending to be ready to really professionalize their operations. They need to increase their staff. They need to care about things like accounting and finance and some of the operational infrastructure that you really need to grow a successful business. For us, and this is something that everyone should think about, we decided that this was where we thought we could add the most value as an investor. As someone who has been a CFO for a long time, it's easy for me to help start-ups with some of those basic kinds of finance issues that they run into whenthey're starting their company. We chose this stage because No. 1, it aligned with where we think our expertise is and where we can get the maximum value from the help that we can provide. But also, tactically speaking, the Series A is a little bit of a tricky investing period because you have the person with a great idea, they've created a product, they're ready. They've sold it to a few people and now they need to go outside of their friends and family, outside of their network. They need a professional sales team, they need this infrastructure and being operators is what type of VC that we are. We saw that gap and where some people shy away from it, we thought that we could come in there and fill that gap really nicely.**Gardner:** That makes a lot of sense Ollen, and I'll tell you, we've heard people use this phrase before I know, it's about to get real. That's like how I think about seed round funding. But when you're Series A, it's now real. Is that fair Ollen?**Douglass:** It's now real and sometimes we can help companies get ready for that free [...] a little bit early, but yes, investors are going to come in, they're going to want to see your deal run. You're no longer having coffee with someone and you have a conversation and they want to invest. Now, you've got to go and see the investment committee and you have to have your pitch book and pitch deck.**Gardner:** One more numbers question for you here Ollen, and I know this is all a little bit relative, so we're not going to hold you to this, but if I'm an entrepreneur listening right now, dreaming that one day, I might make Series A and have Motley Fool Ventures invest alongside me, and we're going to dream about that with you dear listener as well. But if that's me, what is the typical revenue level at the top line that I'm probably going to need to be hitting at a minimum to expect Series A interest.**Douglass:** It used to be for a while there that $1 million in annualized revenue is the minimum and now, actually there have been the one to three range is what people are looking at. I tell you, what's funny is we're been accounted for. I never knew there were so many definitions of revenue until I ran into venture capital. I have never felt older, I feel like I'm running around kids. That's not revenue, get off of my revenue. That's not revenue.**Gardner:** Can you give me an example? You don't have to name names here, but I am still naive enough to think that revenue is revenue, that would be you sold me something in your lemonade stand. I paid you $3 for a cup, you took three bucks in revenues. What are other forms of revenue?**Douglass:** First of all, let me say David, I love lemonade, so this is a very exciting question, but let's say someone, an entrepreneur, sells $30 of lemonade in one weekend.**Douglass:** That's very nice, yes, it's great, very refreshing. They may then say that they have annualized revenue of $1,500.**Gardner:** Every weekend in their minds, they're going to sell $30 of lemonade.**Douglass:** Winter, spring, summer, fall. Yeah, they may do that, or they may have someone who tells them that they are going to come and buy lemonade this weekend and next weekend, and so, \"Hey, I have $60 of revenue because someone promised me they are coming next weekend.\"**Gardner:** Right. So big time accounts receivable being counted on the top line as if it's just locked down. Ironclad cash money.**Douglass:** Back to the original question. When you think about the Series A, people are looking for you to have annualized recurring revenue, which is basically your last quarter times four, that number is somewhere between at least in median, sometimes that maybe even 3 million and they are expecting you to be growing close to 100% a year, if not more, and that's the floor.**Gardner:** Yeah. That's really great to be reminded of so that anybody listening right now who's hoping to get to that stage understands really where they need to be to garner serious looks from Series A funds. Well, thank you for that, Ollen. Now, Eugene has the second question of his three. The second one is for individual angel investors, for example, like himself or I'm sure many others who are listening. What are your thoughts around investing via syndicates or just direct in the start-ups? I take Eugene to be asking basically, should I operate as a lone wolf here, and just invest directly? Or should I be pulling my money with other so-called angels and be a syndicate? Thoughts?**Douglass:** There are lots of angel groups where people come together to look at investments and then invest together. I think that like individual public company investing, sometimes it's better, especially if you're starting to do it together. To share learnings, to get exposure to accelerate your learnings. The camaraderie to increase your deal flow. Because the more people that are out there seeing deals, the more they can come together. The other thing that people do not think about that is a pro for a syndicate is that the amount of money you invest matters. After you take your $30 from the limited standing and you try to do that in a company, you're not going to get as much attention as you would if you and ten of your limited friends make a limited syndicate and come in with $300.**Douglass:** Then you can get a cookie with limited.**Gardner:** Actually, I'm glad you mentioned that because that does in fact connect with Eugene's final question which is about deal flow. A phrase you just used. In layman's terms, we're just talking about how many different companies a potential angel investor or venture capital fund gets to come across, how many deals do they get looked at and presumably more flow is better, especially anything more than a drip. I can imagine sometimes the flow could be too much or too high and you have to start dialing your filters in a little bit. But the question Eugene asked basically is, because it's different from public market investing. Because the only investments you can make are the deals that you see. Any tips on building up deal flow for the venture capitalists out there?**Douglass:** Great, great question, David. Eugene is actually worse than you said. Because you have to find a deal first of all, you have to decide that you'd like it as you said, and then you have to be invited in to invest. Then, depending on how you then negotiate the terms of it, because there are no posted prices and there's a kind of an ask sometimes, then once you go through all that you invest. There are quite a few steps that make it difficult in deal flow is the idea of going out and meeting founders and investors. That you may potentially like so that you can have a chance to talk to them about the likelihood of investing in their company at that infrequent time that they invest, which is only once or twice a year.**Gardner:** Is that ever different from the public markets? Because I never have to ask Google [ **Alphabet** ] or **The Trade Desk** or **Lululemon** for permission to buy its stock. I don't have to ask my broker, could I buy that, but it's totally different for this form of investing.**Douglass:** I guess I would say that Tim Cook never came to you and said, hey David, I'm just wondering, how come you don't call me anymore? Like, why did you sell my stock?**Gardner:** There's a human dynamic here that's completely missing from the public markets.**Douglass:** Yeah. It's very much a relationship business, but getting attached to the network, being in a syndicate or an angel never helps, but just attending venture capital ecosystems events especially at the earlier stages, just to see depreciate, as you say, when you have ideas and products. There are opportunities for individuals who are not known in the industry, say to find great entrepreneurs that they want to back.**Gardner:** Well, thank you for that, Ollen. It does strike me that your reputation in being a good person, being somebody who has a reputation for helping out the entrepreneurs that you're investing in, these kinds of things stand up and count for a lot more, I would assume, in that world than we're used to as just mom-and-pop individual investors in public market companies.**Douglass:** The next question, why in the world are you doing this, Ollen?**Gardner:** That's definitely not. But let me thank Eugene for his questions. He concludes thank you once again David for being the mentor that I've had for the past seven years. But you never knew for teaching me weekly about life and investing every week sharing your wisdom and humor endlessly with a solo, that's very kind of you. Eugene, you're reminding me this is the seventh year of this podcast. That's right. In July of 2021, we concluded our sixth full year, and here we are in the seventh year of the _Rule Breaker Investing_ podcast. A delight to have you tuning in, Eugene.Let's move onto _Rule Breaker_ mailbag item No. 2 this month. This one's from Niraj Kapoor, whose tweet I earlier read out in praise of your appearance last week, and this was his question for you, Ollen. He said, \"Hi, David. Greatly enjoyed the discussion with Ollen as I am,\" says Niraj, \"in the biotech industry. I was just wondering, how does the full venture capital fund value early stage biotechs and what kind of percent stake would you be comfortable taking in a new biotech with a revolutionary idea but no data?\" Niraj says, \"Look forward to your insights.\" I think I know where this one is headed because I know a thing or two about Motley Fool Ventures. Ollen, what is your answer right off the top for Niraj here?**Douglass:** Our preferred stake in biotechs is zero, largely because that whole industry seems insane to me. I tend to ball up in the corner and hide under a blanket and totally go away. That's how I [...] biotech investors.**Gardner:** Well, I love the answer and it's authentic. You said your preference is zero and I think in fact our de facto investment in biotech so far at Motley Fool Ventures is zero, Ollen, following right through with what you said. It is a reminder to me that we don't all have to feel like we need to know something about everything. We truly can say that's in, as Warren Buffett sometimes said \"the too hard to figure out pile\" or maybe that's Charlie Munger. But there are whole aspects of the world of technology that can just be too hard to determine or we're just not confident enough. It's not in our wheelhouse, Ollen, I suppose if you'd come to us instead of coming from the industry of finance where you did come to us from. If you'd come from biotechnology, I'm sure we'd probably have a little bit more of a slant there. Is the Series A biotech investing at the same kinds of levels or does it need to be a bigger deal because they need to raise so much money to actually get FDAapproval? How does that work?**Douglass:** From what I know and obviously outside of my Senior Vice owner's confidence but yes, there are Series A biotechs and sometimes they go public.**Douglass:** It's an entirely different world. What I would say to Nil Raj, for biotech investing in a little more seriousness, a lot of investing whether it's _Rule Breaker_ investing or investing in biotech, so value investing, it's about finding your comfort level and understanding your expertise. Biotech investing from my understanding, tends to be very binary, so that would imply, without any knowledge of biotech at all, just understanding the numbers in math, if you're investing into an area that has lots of binary outcomes, then you need to take more bits, so probably more frequent and smaller bits to spread your risk across multiple companies.**Gardner:** That makes a lot of sense, Ollen, and it is an all or nothing thing. When you say binary it's all or nothing. Because most companies that get a Series A, probably don't end up hitting it big, I think it's fair to say the majority won't, that's a lot of nothings and so you're right, you have to take a volume approach and we're just not going to do that with this fund.Let's move onto, I'd like this one from Karl Sven Nyca. \"Hello David and all,\" and this is _Rule Breaker_ mailbag item No. 3, \"I want to start by saying I am a [...] in the wall Fool.\" Well, glad to know that, Karl. Thank you, Karl with a K by the way, for those keeping score at home. \"I'm not questioning the benefits of investing in the stock market. I'm in for the long term. I do wonder, however, do either of you think the amount of venture capital available today limits opportunity for investors in public companies?\" Karl gives some examples. Recent IPOs like **Roblox** or **Unity** , **Airbnb** , these are the types of companies Karl says that, \" _Rule Breaker_ investing would have scored 100-baggers on, except they came public at valuations in the 10s and even sometimes near $100 billion ranges. It seems to me an opportunity to buy world changing businesses like **Amazon** or **Netflix** at small market capitalizations. It's not possible anymore for those of us who aren't well-heeled enough to invest in seed rounds. Thanks for everything and Fool on.\" Ollen, what's your take?**Douglass:** Karl, a great question and you are correct, companies are staying private longer. One of the things to keep in mind is that these great public companies weren't necessarily great private companies. I think the most common story you hear from public company investors of these large fantastic companies is a story of when they could not give away shares of their company when they were small and they had to talk to 100 people before they could have someone to invest in, and the times when they would have taken money from anyone who would have listened to them. What it would point to is that the journey starts early. There are more and more opportunities for people to invest in private companies. When they're early, you won't know what's going to be the next roadblocks. That's part of the challenge.**Douglass:** But it is getting easier to invest in early stage companies than private. There's some crowdfunding sites that have been around for a while. There is a group called Angeles, Wee. Motley Fool Ventures has invested in the company called Republic, which does equity crowdfunding, and there are other options out there. But more and more opportunities are opening up for people to invest in private companies early.**Gardner:** Well, I appreciate that answer, Ollen, and I agree with it. There are more opportunities than ever before. I want to point out to Karl and really all of us, that while it is true and somewhat to my frustration, that great companies these days, I'm maybe going to say The Motley Fool is an example, stay private indefinitely in some cases or for very long periods of time, and it means that we as _Rule Breaker_ investors don't get a shot. On owning Airbnb, when we first rented on Airbnb and thought, this is a great idea, I wondered if I could buy the stock. Those opportunities in many cases, have been taken away by the venture capital industry in a way that I don't really like it much for. But I would also like to point this out, that the almost unbounded size of the market caps that these companies can still grow into is still inspiring to me. For example, with Airbnb, I think that could be a trillion-dollar company one day, that would be more than a 10-bagger from where itcame public. Just because the numbers are bigger, as companies often come public these days, don't forget the numbers get even bigger than that as we go forward.I remember a time when people thought there could never be a company with a trillion-dollar market cap, then **Apple** did it first, then Apple became a $2 trillion market cap just a few years after that. I think it's worth remembering that all of this is relative and you can definitely still get in early. But to close on this one, Ollen, Karl's right, you do need to be an accredited investor or a little bit better heeled often to get into these kinds of deals. Although pointing out Republic, and some other examples, I feel like that's also in the process of being democratized.So we'll continue watching and hoping for all of us. Well, let's go to the final one. This one comes from Amit Somani. Amit is writing from Bangalore, India. He is the managing partner of Prime Venture Partners, and here is _Rule Breaker_ mailbag item No. 4. \"Hi, David. I'm a practicing early stage venture capitalist myself, and we're now investing in our third fund. I've also been a public market investor and a big fan of the _Rule Breaker_ philosophy for longer than I've been at VC,\" writes Amit. \"I found the podcast with Ollen quite interesting since I often reflect on this myself. I have found myself applying lessons learned from public market investing to private markets and vice versa. I wanted to share a few examples.\" Ollen, I'll just read these out and then pick your favorite or anything you like here and give us some wisdom. Here are some of Amit's examples. \"When one is investing at the seed or Series A stage, you develop a lot of intuition for evaluating the founding teamsand of the total addressable market. Both come in quite handy when evaluating public market investments as well. Again, looking that founding team in the eye, even if it's through your internet camera, and the total addressable market,\" which is something we probably haven't talked that much about in these two weeks we've shared together Ollen. On the other hand, Amit says, \"Portfolio construction in public markets can easily inform your private market start-up investing. Three of my favorite tenets,\" that would be me, David, of _Rule Breaker Investing_ , which are, he lists, \"Letting your winners run high and add up, don't double down, and aim for a 60% win rate. Aim for it anyway, apply,\" says Amit, \"As is to VC portfolio construction. A few dominant winners define most venture capital fund returns. This is a rich topic. I hope you can explore this more in future podcasts.\" Here we are doing it right here in this one. Amit concludes with this lovely line, Ollen. He says, \"I wish oneor more of your venture portfolio companies someday become a _Rule Breaker_ Motley Fool recommendation.\" Well, thank you again, Amit Somani, for writing in. Ollen, thoughts back?**Douglass:** First of all, that final thought is an awesome one and I'd love to come back to that. It's a dream of mine, too, Amit. You mentioned a lot of things there. One of the things I will talk about is we talk about the addressable market for people. What I tell people sometimes is, I'm really trying to simplify venture capital for myself to make sure that I can understand. It's ultimately about three things, people, the business model and the market opportunity. So people, business, and market, different VCs will weigh them differently. I've found it largely along, what their areas of expertise are and their experiences. Yes, that's one of the things that we have translated from the Motley Fool philosophy, is we do focus on people. We want to bag great entrepreneurs trying to do great things. We don't necessarily measure people in the same ways that others do. We know what school you went to but we don't really care, it's probably so we can talk sports.**Douglass:** But what we found is that we just want to invest in people who can demonstrate a history of doing great things, a history of accomplishments.**Gardner:** Yeah, and I don't want to put words into your mouth in this one, Ollen, but I think you put it to me, something like this a while back. You said, I'm going to make this phrase up, let's call it your Saturday afternoon call. It's the Saturday afternoon test. Your phone rings, these days, we could look at our smartphone and see who's calling, and you want to feel like you're excited and happy and looking forward to talking to that young person that we've invested in because you truly enjoy them and you're looking forward to that Saturday afternoon call with them versus, Ollen, failing the Saturday afternoon test where you are dreading, maybe you're sending that London voice mail. But Ollen, Saturday afternoon test, did I get that somewhat right?**Douglass:** No, you got it exactly right, David. The conclusion of that test is that if you're looking at potentially investing in a company and you're dreading picking up the phone, then how about not investing [...]. I will tell you, David, I've had investors that we did not invest in that I'd love to continue to talk to. There have been some companies, and were founders, where I feel like I will pay to not have to talk to them again.**Gardner:** Wow. So if we did not invest in you and you're listening to us right now, it doesn't mean we didn't think you were a great guy or girl.**Gardner:** We probably did, but there are a lot of other considerations, but I love the Saturday afternoon test, Ollen. It's a great reminder to really where we should be putting our money, and we're putting behind the people more than anything else, probably at Series A. Although to Amit's point, certainly, the total addressable market that business opportunity you've been speaking of, Ollen, is important as well. Well, I want to let you go, I want to thank you for four great answers to four great mailbag items. You did want to say something at the end, Ollen, about the idea of one day, might the Motley Fool fund at Series A company that ends up going public. I mean, we would obviously disclose this, and if we ended up making it a _Motley Fool Rule Breaker_ service recommendation to alpha and omega complete the loop, that would be pretty awesome. Thoughts?**Douglass:** I think that that would be great, David. In fact, what's in Motley Fool Ventures, we have a portfolio company, this is all public information, of course, called Affectiva that was bought by a Swedish public company called **Smart Eye**. Affectiva is in the emotion AI space, which is very cutting edge, helping our computers and machines work nicely with human beings. Smart Eye is developing the technology, along with their own, and is using it in autonomous vehicles and even driver-led vehicles to manage what's happening inside the car. I have no insider knowledge about Smart Eye's activities, but I would love for them to one day be on the New York Stock Exchange. The venture fund continues to hold shares in that company, and it has the makings of a _Rule Breaker._**Gardner:** You've mentioned it is a public company. Did you say it's in Sweden?**Douglass:** It's a Swedish public company. It is S-E-Y-E.**Gardner:** All right. Well, I don't pick stocks for _Motley Fool_ _Rule Breakers_ anymore, so I don't know whether they will go to Sweden for any pick, but that's pretty cool. Yeah, I can imagine if your smartphone is propped up on the dashboard of your car and starts noticing that you're going to sleep, it could be awfully helpful in that regard because I'm sure that happens a fair amount out there, sadly, every day on the roadways, so I can see how Affectiva was of interest to Smart Eye. Thank you very much for sharing that as well. Ollen, in conclusion, you've been very generous with your time, Ollen. I'm curious, did you get any notes from your parents on _Rule Breaker Investing_ last week?**Douglass:** David, I'm glad that you asked that. There was a question that I wished I would have been asked, but I didn't, so now, I'm going to ask myself.**Gardner:** Let's do it. I've done that on this podcast before. That's fine.**Douglass:** Here's a question from Ollen to Ollen. \"Hey, Ollen, can you tell us a David Gardner story?\"**Douglass:** Absolutely. I would love to tell you the --**Gardner:** All right. Keep it short then. Keep it short.**Douglass:** I'll keep it short. So I won't tell the story about David Gardner going hunting in Oxfords and a buttoned-down shirt, which is a [...] story. This is a story I will tell. How old is _Rule Breakers_ , David?**Gardner:** Motley Fool _Rule Breakers_ as an investment service started in October of 2004. Our book, _Rule Breakers, Rule Makers_ was 1998. The _Rule Breaker_ portfolio back in the days on AOL, we really started that and rebranded it somewhere around 1996 or so. _Rule Breaking_ has been going on for 20+.**Douglass:** Right. That's an important part of the story. Around 2005, 2006, I remember being in a board meeting, and we were talking about the _Rule Breaker_ service, and whether we could really do one, and though we had done it [...] of it, and I remember at the time looking around the room and thinking, for all of us, including myself, _Rule Breaker Investing_ is almost indistinguishable from magic. We could see the results, but no one really understood how you did it, David. What I have seen over the years is how you have taken what you do in _Rule Breaking_ , which is special and unique, and turned it from a mystery into an art in part size, and you've created a franchise. You've taught so many people how to do it. You've explained your thought process, you put structure around it. You've gotten to the point where now, there's a whole podcast, a whole universe of people who subscribe to _Rule Breaking_ , not as something that they worship of you, but something that they canpractice themselves. I consider myself one of those, and I just wanted to thank you for all the time and effort and energy that you've put into creating this great style of investing, and just making it available to everyone.**Gardner:** Well, thank you, Ollen. I will say that this podcast has been a great vehicle for that. I do feel as if I was writing about it back in 1998 in a book published by Simon and Schuster. It's not that it was ever that obscure, I don't think, but I think something about being here every week and doing that for years and years, and answering questions and putting forward five-stock samples, I think it made it more real for maybe more people. It's my delight to share it. I think if the whole world were _Rule Breakers_ , it would be a better world. I'm delighted, Ollen, to count you among our number. I know that thinking is a lot of time infused, not just in you, but the other members of the team with whom we've worked over the years at Motley Fool Ventures, so it's very kind, and I appreciate you saying that.**Douglass:** Great, David. I think as you think about that history, as we all know, it's to show someone is, one thing to teach them is another level altogether, and I think that's part of the transition, writing a book and actually teaching someone to do it without you is a whole different level of understanding.**Gardner:** Thank you very much. Well, Ollen, I say we call each other then, side swamis.**Douglass:** All righty, side swami. Be easy.**Gardner:** Let's go to a story, _Rule Breaker_ mailbag item No. 5. Thank you for these lovely notes, Sue Evers. Sue writes, \"To Dave and Tom. I currently live in San Francisco and I am 58 years old. I'm sending you both a heartfelt thank you for making it impossible for me to retire well off at 65. If it weren't for you guys, this would never have happened. I grew up homeless as a child until I was 14 years old, when I left the car. It was me and my brother and just my mother. Unfortunately, she had a gambling addiction and most of our Social Security check money was gone soon after receiving it, which would leave us hard up for the entire month. Mom would be left to shoplift and steal gas to get us through to the next month. I never remember much of an education or even being in school or graduating from high school, but yet I enrolled in a city college at the age of 22. I ended up going to the City College of San Francisco and studying photography. I would spend long hours in thedark room on the weekends listening to NPR, and that's when I would listen to you, Motley Fools, in the 1990s. I believe the show was on Sundays around one o'clock, but I can't be positive about that. I listened to you both talk about Vanguard and index funds and about investing in what you know and love and maxing out a Roth. I supported myself through college, working as a bartender and at 27 started to invest in the Vanguard 500 index fund, and any extra money I put into VTSAX.\" Just check that. Yeah, that's the ticker symbol for the Vanguard total market index fund, which owns even more than just the 500 in the S&P 500. It owns, \"the whole market,\" the Vanguard total market index fund.Sue continues, \"Photography ended up becoming a pretty great career for me. I loved what I did. I'm now a caregiver as well as an artist. I never really paid attention to my money's growth until recently. I never touched it and just kept adding to it. No matter what. As long as the market doesn't do anything crazy, recently, I realized I will retire at 65, a millionaire. I remember listening to you guys and fully trusting these two crazy brothers coming through my radio, and I'm so glad I did. I love you both, and I'm glad you two have each other and have also done so well. You were both a part of my morning gratitude meditation. Why aren't you guys teaching more courses on investing in junior and high school? Peace out, Sue Evers.\"Well, Sue first of all, I wanted to share that note because it's just a reminder of what a motley world we live in. We're all from different walks of life. Even if you grew up in the same zip code to somebody, you might look completely different from them, or at least act or think completely different from them. One of the true joys I take in doing this podcast every week, but especially the mailbags, is being able to share a story like yours, which for me is just beautiful. It's inspirational to think about the odds that were against you from the earliest days in your life and your childhood, which must have been so difficult, so much more difficult than mine and I'm sure most of those who are listening to me, and to think that you made the best of it. I've often used this analogy because hey, I'm a gamer. Each of us has dealt a hand of cards and they are all different. Some of them are easy to play and some of them are hard. But the goal is to play the hand of cards you're dealt thebest you possibly can and Sue Evers it seems to me you have done just that.To answer your question, The Motley Fool has made inroads at different points into trying to get this material into classrooms. One thing we did is we wrote a book called _The Motley Fool Investing Guide for Teens_ , which has a lot of five-star reviews on Amazon. It's a little outdated these days, probably in need of a new edition, but I hope it still reads helpfully and somewhat freshly for teens of today. We have found it hard to figure out how to crack the school system. There are lots of different districts, lots of different states. In the end, I think we've relied on teachers, and that's not just formal professional teachers. Sometimes it's an aunt or an uncle, or somebody who takes the time at a church group, somebody who takes the time to spread the word of long-term investing, the benefits of being a Fool. I can't say we've figured it out Sue, but through The Motley Fool Foundation as well, I think we have better and better odds of reaching more and more people. I'm going tosay these last three mailbags I got, including yours, mentioned parents. I want to say something about your mother. I'm sure she was in such a difficult position, and boy, gambling addiction on top of things really makes life incredibly difficult. But I hope that you have learned to appreciate what she did for you, trying to help you survive, even though she made so many mistakes along the way.Anyway, parents are a little bit the theme of the latter portion of this month's mailbag and Sue, you just kicked it off with _Rule Breaker_ mailbag item No. 5. Thank you for sharing your story. There are two more mailbag items this week, No. 6 and No. 7. Again, parents are the theme for the latter half of this podcast. This is a hard one to read, but it's a beautiful note as well, and it's from a friend of mine. His name is Eric Eason. Eric has volunteered and helped out around The Motley Fool, he's done some contracting with us. I once had him on a previous version of this podcast, before the _Rule Breaker Investing_ podcasts launched in July of 2015. I did something called the _Supernova Podcast_ back when The Motley Fool had a service that I headed up called _Motley Fool Supernova_. I used to do a podcast for just those members, joined by my friend and sidekick, Max Keeler of _Investor Island_ fame. I enjoyed doing that podcast, although it was for a much smaller group of people,just the members of that service. I'm delighted that _Rule Breaker Investing_ today is free and can reach everybody.But back when I did that podcast, I had Eric on because he has a professional career in astrophysics, some flavor anyway of astronomy. Eric, I can't exactly remember your professional calling, but I remember this. You and I had a great conversation about our mutual high confidence that not only are human beings on planet Earth, not only probably not the only censored species in the universe, but Eric, you and I talked back and forth with each other. The odds are that the universe is teeming with life in a way we couldn't possibly even comprehend. If you think about just one galaxy alone, the Milky Way has somewhere between 100 billion and 400 billion stars. So our sun is one of the 100 billion at least stars in the Milky Way and a bunch of those have planets revolving around them as well. Then the Milky Way is just one of approximately 100 billion galaxies that we have identified thus far. Yeah, the odds that there's a heck of a lot of life out there in my mind, extremely high.Anyway, let's leave deep outer space for now and get right back to your note, which is a really hard note to read, Eric, and a beautiful note and I'm going to share it because I think it's going to make all of us better. You've entitled this note, \"Great expectations are a cruel mistress. Hi, David. I know I'm mixing metaphors with my letter's title, but the month of May was momentous to me and my family. For me, it began well with my second COVID vaccination, which enabled me to travel again, followed shortly by my 65th birthday, and the initiation of Medicare, which appears to work well enough. My brother John, his wife, and I soon travel to Montana to visit a friend of theirs to celebrate their joint birthdays, born two hours apart. As COVID restrictions were to be lifted at my parents' retirement community, John and I also bought airfare to visit our folks in Austin, in early June. Then the foreshadowing began. The first was on my birthday when I listened to the _Practicing Human_podcast by Cory Muscara, in which he read the brief poem \"Otherwise\" by Jane Kenyon. It begins with the stanza and I quote, \"I got out of bed on two strong legs, it could have been otherwise.\" The poem continues with mundane moments in a typical day in which she realizes the profound gifts of what she has, for it could have been otherwise. I began doing so myself acknowledging each morning my health and the health and love of my family members still living. Next came you, speaking on your _Rule Breakers_ podcast. You reiterated one of your quotes that happiness equals reality divided by expectations that has long resonated with me. I began to contemplate it anew and then came the extra podcast to your _A Road Less Traveled in 10-and-a-Half Chapters,_ in which you encourage your listeners to lead a more interesting life. Since retiring,\" Eric writes, \"I have felt the same unease within me that I suspect you are increasingly feeling, that persistent question emerging from within askinghow I now wish to bring meaning and fulfillment to my life going forward. The last foreshadowing arrived in the last week of May, as I watched Episode 8 of Disney's show _WandaVision_.\" Now, I suppose I have to insert a little bit of a spoiler here. If you are in the middle of _WandaVision_ and haven't reached Episode 8 or think one day you'd like to watch _WandaVision_ , which is a very worthy Marvel show on the Disney+ Network, hit \"Skip Forward\" about 60 seconds in this podcast. Spoiler alert. Here we go. By the way, I should mention, I'm at about Episode 5 of _WandaVision_. This is a spoiler for me, but I'm OK with it. Here we go. \"In a pointed scene in which Wanda is immersed, deeply in grief, her husband Vision so gently says to her, what is grief but love, persevering?\"That arrow found its mark. Eric writes, \"In my soul, I immediately paused the show to absorb and feel.\" What he just said. We have all felt it. We're feeling in time, the grief of loss of a loved one. For me, it's been grandparents, aunts, uncles, many friends, and my sister. Each day thereafter became imbued. Therefore, with these foreshadowings. First, I wake into good health and the good health of a loving family, it did not have to be so. Second, I strive to lower expectations to live a happier life. Third, I contemplate what it means to me to lead a more interesting life. Four, I recall past grief as love persevering. While three days later, I woke to good health and to a text message that my healthy, vibrant, joyful, loving mom was dying and was to die within half an hour. I was in shock, barely able to pack my bags as John and I took the next plane to Austin, upon our arrival after midnight, we found daddy in shock and heartbroken so much so that a week later we took him to theemergency room for what the doctors diagnosed as, 'Heartbreak syndrome,' that was affecting his heart. Everyone in their retirement community from friends, neighbors, and the staff were in shock as well as everyone expected her to outlive daddy and to easily live to 100. It was an expectation so implicit in our lives since daddy's heart attack when he was 42 and bypass surgery at 54. That none of us was aware that our beliefs were nothing more than an expectation of my parents and their best friends so close that their aunt and uncle to me, they all understood that daddy would be the first to go. Well, he is now the last one.Three things have made losing momma in this way so very difficult. The first is that we were not afforded the chance to say goodbye. With all that was going on in May, we hadn't spoken with her in a couple of weeks. Then there is a heartbreak that after 18 months of pandemic and due separation, John and I were about 12 days from seeing her again. But the biggest contributor of all was the implicit expectation that since she was so healthy and vibrant, she would live to 100. Great expectations are a cruel mistress, David, as they are deeply ingrained to the point of being implicit in our world view and yet have nothing to do with reality. Happiness is indeed reality divided by expectations. But after experiencing the month of May 2021 and its aftermath, I would like to offer an addendum. In closing, joy is the grace we bring to the outcome. Your friend, Eric Eason.\" When I say your friend, I think he was writing that to me, but I think he's describing that to you as well, dear listener,because we're all friends here, we learn from each other. That is an absolutely heartbreaking note to read. So much of me sees life as a glass half-full. I think that's well documented and I bet a lot of you who are listening to me feel the same way. Yet, it doesn't mean that every outcome is as we would wish it to be.I really appreciate Eric's point about how sometimes implicitly in our minds we make such assumptions about reality that they become real for us. We couldn't imagine those assumptions not playing out. Yet when they don't, especially in an intimate context, that can be absolutely heartbreaking. In addition to Eric's beautiful line at the end, joy is the grace, we bring to the outcome maybe conclude this. Let's you and I take nothing for granted.Well, Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 7 is coming up continuing our parents' theme. But before I close to that, I do want to mention quickly that next month is _Authors in August_. Next week we're going to be covering the book _Positive Intelligence_ by Shirzad Chamine. Can't wait to have Shirzad back for a return of periods. We'll be talking about his book. If you've not already read _Positive Intelligence_ , you don't have to read it by next week, but I highly suggest you start it. I think you're going to benefit from it as I have. Week two of August, by the way, features another book that I think you will love and benefit from and why would I not tell you about it now, so you can get started. It's called _Do More Great Work_ by Michael Bungay Stanier. Rule Breaker Mailbag item No. 7, continuing the theme of parents and making sure we appreciate them. Maybe this is on my mind today because my dad turned a new birthday this month and my mother's mother did, and they're both in theirmid-80s. That's probably why this is on my mind more so than usual and yet these are the notes that showed up in the mailbag. I think that they're so worthy and I love the somatic thrust that they have to them. Let's go to Miguel Garza to close out this week's _Rule Breaker Investing_ podcast. You'll see why this one follows in a lovely way from Eric Eason's story that I just shared with you. \"Hi David, my dad passed away in February 2020, just before the pandemic. He was a firm believer of investing in the stock market for better and extraordinary returns. Well, I'm currently a Fool, _Motley Fool Stock Advisor_. I found The Motley Fool after my dad passed away. The _Rule Breaker Investing_ podcast, the Fool philosophy, reminds me so much of my dad that I quickly became interested and started to follow your principles. I have also had the fortune of having my dad teach me about stocks since I was a teenager as well. We both went to Wharton business school for our MBA. Even though wehave good knowledge about finance, the philosophy of saving, investing and most importantly, waiting is not something that is learned in business school. Thank you so much for what you do. I will leave you a small PowerPoint about how the Mexican stock market has also been doing great over the long term. Or as my father calls it, 'the million-dollar secret.' Hope you have time to go over it all the best, Miguel Garza.\"I'm so happy to hear what your dad did for you and like you, I also had a parent in this case, my dad who coaches kids about the stock market and that coaching went on, as I said, to dad on the phone once again this week for his birthday, that his coaching is why The Motley Fool exists today. No Paul Gardner, no Motley Fool. Tom and I have always known and appreciated that and perhaps we can never really thank our parents enough. We heard a little while ago, the parent who stole for her children. It is just truly desperate and sad, yet at the heart of it, we can see something of love, love and survival. Your dad, Miguel, who raised you to learn what you couldn't have learned in business school, how to invest Foolishly. His spirit is implicit in many ways for you in this podcast. I hope I will continue to deliver for you. Thank you for writing in. I'm sure you spoke of some interest among listeners in the long-term performance of the Mexican stock market. By the way, but more thananything, along with Eric Eason and Sue Evers, you're reminding us to make sure we appreciate it. Well, this is this week's eye-opener, fellow Fools, to take care of these parents and to take nothing for granted.This article represents the opinion of the writer, who may disagree with the \u201cofficial\u201d recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service.

Although Soviet citizens missed out on 69 years of fashion and music, you can see past decades play themselves out in perfect harmony in parallel storefronts. Maybe you missed out on the \u201980s or maybe feel nostalgia for the early \u20192000s? In Russia, there is a bar for whatever era you would like to revisit. In St. Petersburg, for example, you can walk from a metal bar, where headbangers dressed like **Marilyn Manson** will fly into a frenzy over songs like **Korpiklaani 's **\u201cVodka,\u201d to a rockabilly bar, where retro-clad oddballs twist and shout to **The Trashmen 's** \u201cBird Is the Word.\" Many Eurotrash bars still line the city, where Paris Hilton and Fred Durst look-alikes party like it's the early '2000s.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.Considering the Russian people's Proustian ability to regain lost time, it is no wonder that metal is still alive and raging there. In a territory, where citizens could once be arrested for owning a saxophone, rock is still more transgressive than it is in the United States. Despite restrictions, Russian rock has been going strong since the '60s. It took a gothic turn in the '80s, owing to creative activity in Yekaterinburg. Pioneers like Joanna Stingray, who married **Kino 's/Cinema's **guitarist Yuri Kasparyan, helped to smuggle music in and out of the Soviet Union. Great examples of Russian rock's admixture of lightness and Faustian grit include the identically named song \u00ab\u041d\u0435\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f\u00bb/\u201cNecrophilia\" (1987) by \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430/Civil Defense and an identically-named 1994 track by \u041a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439/Crematorium. If you think these songs hit the bull's eye, Russian hard rock and metal bands blow the whole bull to pieces. Many American metal fans enjoy the Siberian deathcore group **Slaughterto Prevail**.

Ever since **\u0410\u0440\u0438\u044f** released its debut album, \u041c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u044f **/Meglomania** (1985), the group has made a public sport of its \u00ab\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u043d\u0451\u043c\u00bb/\u201cGame with Fire.\u201d \u00ab\u0414\u0430\u0439 \u0436\u0430\u0440\u0430\u00bb/\u201cBring the Heat\u201d \u2014 **Aria** remains hot and in-demand after 36 years while many of its British heavy metal inspirations have burnt out. In its early years, **Aria** adapted western songs like **Golden Earring\u2019s** \u201cGoing on the Run.\u201d This became the mega-hit \u00ab\u0411\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u00bb/\u201cCarefree Angel.\u201d Before long, western musicians began covering **Aria**. That is exactly what **Till Lindemann** and **Richard Kruspe** of **Rammstein** did in their 2003 single \u201cSchtiel\u201d \u2014 a misspelling of \u00ab\u0428\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c\u201d/\u201cCalm,\u201d which actually comes from the German word Stille. **Till** and **Richard** may have been enticed by the fact that **Aria** originally recorded \u00ab\u0428\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c\u00bb as a duet between their original vocalist**Valery Kipelov** and **Udo Dirkschneider**. As an ongoing celebration of metal excellence, **Aria** -Fest has attracted international groups, such as **U.D.O.** , **M\u00e4go de Oz** , and **Stratovarius**.Some of **Aria\u2019s** most wicked tracks include \u00ab\u0414\u0443\u0445 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b\u00bb/\u201cSpirit of War,\u201d \u00ab\u0423\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u00bb/\u201cStreet of Roses,\u201d \u00ab\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0440\u043e\u00bb/\u201cTorero,\u201d \u00ab\u041a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0435\u0439\u00bb/\u201cColiseum.\u201d Expect pyrotechnics, powerful vocals, and wicked guitar solos at an **Aria** concert. Aria has undergone various lineup changes throughout the years. Guitarist Vladimir Holstinin, however, has been with the group from its conception. Holstinin only briefly took time off in 2015 to undergo back surgery in Israel. Bass guitarist Vitaly Dubinin has been with the band nearly as long as Holstinin, whom he played within his school days. One of the most amusing moments in **Aria** -history occurred unintentionally when an interviewer asked **Aria\u2019s** second vocalist, **Arthur Berkut** , with whom the pair also jammed with as students, about his dismissal. To the question, \u201cWhat happened, **Arthur**?\u201d **Berkut** responded with a raised index finger, \u201cPonchiki!\u201d After **Berkut** refused to hand over his bag of donuts and sour cream \u2014 a popularRussian combo \u2014 he realized that he had irremediably offended Dubinin. **Arthur** allegedly tried to remedy the situation.

For all his talent and unparalleled zeal, **Berkut** will forever be remembered as the tampon vocalist. Mikhail Zhitnyakov replaced **Berkut** , who then founded the group **Arthur Berkut** , which was named in the Russian style of humility. Every now and then **Berkut** , whose name means Golden Eagle, swoops over to America.Despite all of its passion, **Aria\u2019s** theme song may as well be \u00ab\u0412\u043e\u043b\u044f \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u043c\u00bb/\u201cWill and Reason\u201d \u2014 a track that has been used to unite various voices across the Russian rock scene.

Most listeners will agree that **Kipelov** is the best lead singer of the Russian metal world. Who is **Valery Kipelov** \u2014 the man whose voice sounds like 6,666 tons of steel?! **Valery Kipelov** is a clean-living, considerate, modest gentleman. At the beginning of Covid, Valery gladly sought refuge in the peace and quiet of his dacha \u2014 summer house. Since then, he has been back behind the mic but not behind the steering wheel. Because \"Valera\" doesn't drive, his wife chauffeurs him to his gigs.In 1997, **Kipelov** collaborated with red-headed guitarist and Kazan-native **Sergey Mavrin** on the album _\u0421\u043c\u0443\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f/Troubled Time_. By then, **Mavrin** had already broken away from **Aria** whereas **Kipelov** still sang for the group. This duo project was a success given that **Mavrin** and **Kipelov** were the two most rock-star musicians to have played with **Aria**. **Kipelov** is recognized as one of his generation\u2019s greatest performers while **Mavrin** is distinguished by his unusual guitar technique, which fans have dubbed \u00ab\u041c\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0433\u00bb/\u201cMavring.\u201d _\u0421\u043c\u0443\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f\u2019s_ 4th track _,_ \u00ab\u042f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043d!\u00bb/\u201cI'm Free!\u201d became one of Russia\u2019s most popular songs. \u201c\u042f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043d!\u201d has permeated so deeply into the Russian collective consciousness that any babushka, child, or anchorite can recall its words at the snap of a finger.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.When **Valery** **Kipelov** created the group **Kipelov** in 2002, drummer Alexander Manyakin defected from **Aria** to join his friend. **Mavrin** also came aboard for a brief period before leaving to his focus once again on his group **Mavrin** , originally called **Mavrik**. **Mavrin** has never had luck with vocalists. This held the band back from realizing its potential. For instance, **Mavrin** had to fire **Berkut** for disappearing during the recording the album _\u0425\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u043d/Chemical Sleep_ (2001). Yet, **Mavrin** has endured and continues to perform songs like \u00ab\u041a\u0440\u044b\u043b\u044c\u044f\u00bb/\u201cWings,\u201d the instrumental version of \u00ab\u042f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043d!\u00bb The rift between **Mavrin** and **Kipelov** has caused confusion over music rights. As a result, each group spawned its own version of the song \u00ab\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043a\u00bb/\u201cProphet,\u201d for example. There is some overlap between the tracks used by **Aria** and **Kipelov**. Nevertheless, all parties involved seem amicable. From time to time, **Aria\u2019s** former musicians pop overonto each other\u2019s projects and live concert albums as can be viewed above. Poet Margarita Pushkina has contributed her verses to **Aria** , **Kipelov** , **Mavrin** , and many other Russian bands. This has further muddled the question of identity in the incestuous pool of Russian metal talent. Fortunately, **Kipelov\u2019s** members have been loyal. **Kipelov\u2019s** original guitarist Alexandr Kharkov remains with the group. Guitarists Andrey Golovanov and Vyacheslav Molchanov arrived respectively in 2003 and 2006.Where can you find **Kipelov**? The band is ready to greet your welcome with the song \u00ab\u042f \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c\u00bb/\u201cI\u2019m Here\u201d:If you are curious about how **Kipelov\u2019s** version of \u00ab\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043a\u00bb/\u201cProphet\u201d turned out, listen to the group\u2019s guitarists shred to **Mavrin\u2019s** music:#### 3\\. \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c \u0438 \u0428\u0443\u0442/Korol i Shut **Korol i Shut** , which means **King and Jester** , was Russia\u2019s best and most brutal punk band. There has never been a phenomenon like **Korol i Shut** , nor will there ever be again. To call **Korol i Shut** a punk band is misleading. **Korol i Shut** blends elements of horror, folk-rock, and metal. The group always employed a violinist to add a woodsy vibe. When one listens to **KiSh** , one imagines a chainsaw-carrying lumberjack in pursuit of trolls and little girls. **KiSh\u2019s** music is both energized and trippy. The song title \u00ab\u0425\u0430\u0440\u0434\u043a\u043e\u0440 \u043f\u043e-\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u00bb/\u201cHardcore Russian-style\u201d describes the band\u2019s mission statement in a nutshell.Advertisement.

In 1996, the group released its first studio album _\u041a\u0430\u043c\u043d\u0435\u043c \u043f\u043e \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435/Stone Against the Head_ , which is as badass as its daredevil title sounds. Formed in 1988, **Korol i Shut** infused the essence of St. Petersburg and its many dichotomies into everything it produced. **KiSh\u2019s** music elicits all of the dampness of its marshy city. The collective looked like a bunch of swamp critters. Members often made themselves up like ghouls in tired, pale makeup with dark accents around the eyes. **KiSh** could have only arisen in response to the conflicting forces of its time, and yet its incorporated mythologies and existential impressions on the soul are timeless. **Korol i Shut** blends sophistication with barbarism. Singing along to **KiSh** songs with vodka and guitars at a table full of Russians is one of the most cathartic experiences that life has to offer. **Korol i Shut** was so savage, that it was one of the few bands thatcan write songs about magic tricks and clowns without sounding nerdy. On this note, _\u0422\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440 \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0430/Theater of the Demon_ (2010) roused controversy with fans. Many followers deemed the album\u2019s turn towards lighter style to be a letdown. Although _\u0422\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440 \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0430_ truly was a charming and impish masterpiece, it was also co-vocalist Andrei Knyazev\u2019s last album with the band.As a father of two, Knyazev felt that Gorsheniov\u2019s drug use was irresponsible. Once Knyazev exited the band, Gorsheniov began to work on his rock opera _TODD_ and recorded two accompanying **KiSH** albums. After his death, the rock opera went on. A new actor replaced Gorsheniov. **KiSh** , however, could not go on. It took **KiSH** a year to make the announcement official. Many commemorative concerts have been held in Gorshok\u2019s honor. It has been reported that before his final death, Gorsheniov was pronounced clinically dead on seven different occasions. That means that the practitioner of black magic almost made it to nine lives. On 19 July 2013, Gorsheniov was found dead at 39 for the last time with a spoon at his bedside. A public funeral service at Yubileyny Sports Complex in St. Petersburg drew 7,000 fans. Lines of leather-clad observers weeped, wailed, and gnashes their teeth on the streets. Gorshok left behind a beautiful wife, daughter, and stepdaughter. After completing hisfarewell tour with **\u041a\u0443\u043a\u0440\u044b\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441\u044b/Kukryniksy** , Gorshok\u2019s brother **Alexei** started a new band in 2018 using the family\u2019s surname **Gorsheniov**.When Andrei Knyazev and Mikhail Gorsheniov first met, the former was studying art restoration while the latter was already an aspiring musician. In the early days, Knayzev would show Gorshok his sketches. Andrei would later design many of **KiSh\u2019s** album covers. Immediately attracted to Andrei as a friend and person of culture, Gorsheniov asked him to begin writing lyrics for him. Although both Knyazev and Gorsheniov played the guitar for **KiSh** at times, their primary roles evolved to place bot men in the position of **KiSh\u2019s** frontmen. Their chemistry was supernatural. Gorsheniov could modulate his voice to sound magnificently creepy. A rebel from birth, Gorshok lost his front teeth as a child when he tried to grab hold of the monkey bars with his mouth. Gorshok\u2019s enunciation was certainly affected by his dental woes. The singer sometimes sported a prosthetically corrected smile, but he was most loved when he went au naturale. Both Knyazev and Gorshok had rich, deep, masculinevoices. \u00ab\u0412\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0432\u0438\u00bb/\u201cRecollections of Former Love\u201d is a good example Gorsheniov\u2019s vocal power. **KiSH\u2019s** \"\u041b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a\u00bb/\u201cWoodsman,\" an upbeat tune about cannibalism, often ranks as the best Russian rock song.

Knyazev is one of Russia\u2019s most charismatic entertainers, although he is often underrated. Gorshok cast the darkest shadow of any of **KiSH\u2019s** members, and there are many who perceive Knyazev as overshadowed. In many regards, however, Andrei outshined Gorshok. Whereas Gorshok maintained the quirky allure of a sorcerer, Andrei Knyazev's magnetism is of the more traditional and jocular variety. Knyazev projects strength and manhood. That seems natural, given that some of **Korol i Shut 's** best-known songs are \u00ab\u0415\u043b\u0438 \u043c\u044f\u0441\u043e \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043a\u0438\u00bb/\u201cThe Men Ate Meat\u201d and \u00ab\u0420\u043e\u043c\u00bb/\u201cRum.\u201d As a group, **KnyaZz** keeps its lyrics clean. Considering Gorshok\u2019s drug habits, it is a wonder that Knyazev and the latter refrained from turning illegal substances into a theme in **KiSh\u2019s** songs. As mentioned, Andrei strives to be a good role model while knowing how to channel his inner monster. Like **KiSh** , **KnyaZz** always uses aviolinist. For certain tracks, **KnyaZz** has even added a trumpeter.Are you sick of hearing Adele on the radio?

Gorsheniov\u2019s family gave his bandmates the right to continue using the name **Korol i Shut.** The surviving band members, nevertheless, refused to continue use the name without Mikhail. Knyazev, meanwhile, refused to rejoin the group. **KiSH** had to die, but only death will stop its musicians from being creative. Alexandr Schigoliev, Pavel Sazhinov, Yakov Tsvirkunov, Alexandr \u201cRenegade\u201d Leontiev, and Alexandr Kulikov, who had been playing bass with **KiSh** for under a year, decided to rechristen themselves. The rest is the history of how a phoenix rose from ashes.It is touching to see how Alexandr Leontiev has not only stepped up to the plate but filled it beyond expectation. Fans assumed that he had a creative voice. Who knew he had a singing voice? Within no time, **Severny Flot** pulled itself together as an ensemble to rock crowds as if they had been together since **Korol i Shut\u2019s** conception. In reality, only Schigoliev, who had been briefly replaced by **Alexei Gorsheniev** , had been an original member of **KiSh**. Tsvirkunov, who deserves major credit, had been the **KiSh 's** guitarist since the '90s. It is hard to picture him without mentally superimposing a picture of Gorshok beside him. Borne of hardship, the band has a totally different feel, as if it had been grounded by a fall to concrete, as opposed to the fertile earth of **KiSh\u2019s** maggot-infested fairytales.The aptly named \u00ab\u0412\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0451\u0434 \u0438 \u0412\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445\u00bb/\u201cForward and Upward\u201d came as a comfort to fans in 2014:Do you want to hear the track that inspired the **Severny Flot\u2019s** name?

The band mocked Soviet and post-Soviet society with songs like \u00ab\u041a\u043e\u043b\u0445\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u043d\u043a\u00bb/\u201cKolkhoz Punk\u201d and \u00ab\u0421\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0439\u0444\u00bb/\u201cVillage High.\u201d **Sektor Gaza** is known for their sexually explicit lyrics and radical openness regarding drug use. Russia has a language called \u043c\u0430\u0442/mat, which is comprised of dirty words. If you want to impress your Russian friends, **Sektor** will teach you what a tutor cannot. **Sektor** took some stabs at subjects like Russian folklore.

While no topic was too lofty for the group to smear with its own black brand of varnish, no topic wastoo mundane either. **Sektor Gaza** painted daguerreotypes of aging relatives in songs like \u00ab\u041c\u043e\u044f \u0431\u0430\u0431\u043a\u0430\u00bb/\u201cMy Grandma\u201d\u2019and \u00ab\u0422\u0451\u0449\u0430\u00bb/\u201cMy Mother-in-Law.\u201d Some fans suspect that the group\u2019s singer, Yuri \u201cKhoi\u201d Klinskikh, was poisoned by his mother, by the way.Klinskikh passed away at 35 on 4 July 2000. Yuri\u2019s girlfriend was driving him back from a day of filming for his latest music video \u00ab\u041d\u043e\u0447\u044c \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445\u0430\u00bb/\u201cNight of Fear\u201d when the musician turned blue. Yuri left behind a wife and two daughters. Although surviving group members tried to carry on Khoi\u2019s legacy with the group **ex-Sektor Gaza** , the attempt holds little appeal without \u201cYura.\u201d In a fate similar to Yura's, **Sektor Gaza 's** guitarist, Vadim Glukhov, was found dead at 45 in 2011. His body was discovered in the vicinity of a war aerodrome with bottles of booze. **Sektor 's** bassist, Sergei Tupikin, died in 2018 after years of disablement resulting from a beating. Singer Tatiana Fateeva, who sometimes sang alongside Yura in his satirical romantic ballads strives to keep the group's memory alive. Concerts are still held in **Sektor Gaza 's** honor, and many people celebrate Klinskikh as a \u00ab\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u00bb/\u201cnational poet.\u201d With lyrics like, \u201c\u2026 our lives are short\u2026 as a puttana'sskirt,\u201d is it any wonder? **Sektor** had always experimented with various musician styles. Its last album, however, _\u0412\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0430\u0434\u0430/Hellraiser_ (2000) points to a heavier style and what the band could have been. _\u0412\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0430\u0434\u0430_ sets a tone of confidence with its opening track \u00ab\u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u00bb/\u201cDemobilization.\u201d \u2014 Oddly enough, **Sektor** and the highly subversive Klinskikh, a former member of the \u0414\u041f\u0421, the Russian traffic police, had been invited to play a similar song \u00ab\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0439\u00bb/\u201cTime To Go Home\u201d outside of the Kremlin. \u2014 The album features some of Sektor\u2019s most metal songs like \u00ab\u0421\u043e\u0436\u0436\u0451\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0434\u044c\u043c\u0430\u00bb/\u201cBurnt Witch.\u201d Throughout its career, **Sektor** has released countless novel tracks: \u00ab\u042f\u0434\u0440\u0451\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0448\u044c\u00bb/\u201cNuclear Louse,\u201d \u00ab\u0418\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u00bb/\u201cImpotent,\u201d \u00ab\u0413\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043a\u00bb/\u201cCarouse, Man,\u201d \u00ab\u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0433\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0447\u043a\u0430\u00bb/\u201cDelirium Tremens,\u201d \u00ab\u0422\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043d\u00bb/\u201cFog.\u201dThe final and title song from _\u0412\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0430\u0434\u0430/Hellraiser_ names 1999 as the \u201cfatal year,\u201d when the \u201cthree horns\u201d of the last three digits will turn upwards into 666.

People may say they monkey around, but [continuing in the words of _The Monkees_ ] they\u2019re too busy singing to put anybody down. That is why **Tarakany!\u2019s** single \u00ab\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043d\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c\u00bb/\u201cJust to be Normal\u201d is such a great song. It discusses the struggle to embark on one\u2019s own artistic journey while remaining respectful towards pragmatic family members. The video features a young boy with a guitar watching older relatives humping. **Tarakany!\u2019s** lead singer Dmitry \u201cSid\u201d Spirin, who began as the band\u2019s bassist, explains: \u201cThere are two definitions of punk. The first \u2014 this is when normal guys try to look fucked-up. This sooner suits the **Sex Pistols**. But the second \u2014 this is when fucked-up guys try with all their might to look normal, this is the Ramones. So, I have been trying with all my might to be normal, because frankly, fucked-up people, who believe in reptilian humanoids annoy me wildly.\u201d That is a rather thoughtful definition, considering that **Die \u00c4rzte\u2019s** lead singer, **Farin Urlaub** also of **Farin Urlaub The Racing Team** , announced his definition of punk in a drumroll moment as a person, who lives on social welfare.Perhaps differences of opinion are what has united **Tarakany!** with **Die \u00c4rzte\u2019s** Rod, a Chilean-born bassist. Rod contributed his uber funky awesomeness to the German version of **\u00ab** \u041f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0440\u044b\u00bb/\u201cBad Dancers\u201d/\u201cSchlechte T\u00e4nzer.\u201d Before there was Seth Rogan's _Sausage Party_ (2016), there was **Tarakany! 's** \u00ab\u041f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0440\u044b\u00bb music video, which featured three elderly Russians dancing through Moscow while under the totally low-key guise of phallus costumes. The title of **Tarakany! 's** 11th album release \u2014 _MaximumHappy I_ (2013), which includes \u00ab\u041f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0440\u044b\u00bb originated \u2014 summarizes the feeling the band induces in its listeners. Although **Tarakany!** tackles social issues like poverty in songs like \u00ab\u0421\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0447\u044c\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0446\u0435\u00bb/\u201cDog\u2019s Heart,\u201d the band\u2019s sense of humor is its selling point.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading. **Tarakany!** look, sound, and act like a bunch of rabid New Yorkers. Perhaps that is why joining up with **Marky Ramone** for The **Ramones** Night European Tour in 2005 seemed like the natural step to take. **Tarakany!** and **Marky** had previously played a trio of shows together in 2003. **Tarakany!** has even collsborated with groups like **Anti-Flag**. After all, **Tarakany!** is a veteran group. **Tarakany!** has been creeping and crawling, since it was formed in Moscow in 1991. Remarkably, the band seems as fresh as if its teenage rebellion were still in its first spring. **Tarakany!** has performed globally and in massive venues, but you can also catch them grooving on small, chic St. Petersburg rooftops.If spatial confinement during Covid is bugging you, get active with some \u201cBad Dancers\u201d and bad German right now:**Tarakany!** sings it best: \u00ab\u0422\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u2014 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u044c\u00bb/\u201cSilence\u2014 It\u2019s Death.\u201d End it. This is your remedy: **Dekabr** , which means **December** , is a hard rock group with punk and metal influences in its arsenal. Formed in 1999 in St. Petersburg, **Dekabr** has gained a die-hard following among bikers. The controversial biker gang \u041d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0438/The Night Wolves adore Dekabr with a peculiar fondness. **Dekabr** is a favorite at rock festivals and on the popular station Nashe Radio. **Dekabr\u2019s** lead singer, Mikhail Semyonov is deeply rooted in his religious beliefs. Mikhail is an old-school father. He refrains from drugs and volunteers at charity concerts. In 2014, the band released a song in Mikhail Gorsheniov\u2019s honor called \u00ab\u041f\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0447\u0443\u0442\u00bb/\u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry.\u201dAdvertisement.

The band was affiliated with the fabled Sverdlovsk Rock Club, which helped to pioneer Russian rock while under threat from the authorities. **Gleb** and **Vadim 's** mother, a doctor, hooked the boys on opioids. Drugs would dictate everything from the themes of the brothers\u2019 songs to the artful yet spastic way they gesticulated. Although **Agatha 's** songs may have sounded benign, the group's lyrics were often among the most philosophically twisted. Like many Soviet/post-Soviet rock groups, the punch was not in the band\u2019s style but rather the content. Although the brothers worked together for a 2015**Agatha Christie** reunion, it seems as though a quick promotional buck could hardly pay them to stand each other\u2019s company. **Gleb\u2019s** intoxication levels frequently prevent him from fulfilling his duties. In one recent incident, he could not even muster the balance to perform a single song. **Gleb** makes **Ozzy Osbourne** look like an accountant. Although **Vadim** is the more responsible brother, he also fails on occasion to show up where he is expected. For all its troubles, **Agatha Christie** remains so well-liked that you can still observe crowds gathered on street corners to hear young musicians playing their music. **The Matrixx** amps up the raunch, shock, and violence. **Gleb** has described the band as neo-post-gothic. **The Matrixx** is industrial, electronic, experimental, sometimes minimalist, and always cold. **The Matrixx** is both glam and glam\u2019s suicide. **The Matrixx\u2019s** first albums _\u041f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a\u043e/Beautifully Brutal_ (2010) and _\u0422\u0440\u044d\u0448/Tresh_ (2011) jarred fans by virtue of their departure from **Agatha Christie\u2019s** thin yet apparent baseline of sanity. Some fans adjusted to the change. Others were left wondering: Is this what **Rammstein** would sound like with a sustained head injury? Whatever one may say about **Gleb** , his extraordinary creativity and intelligence still shine through. In a country where profanity is banned in the arts, **Gleb\u2019s** boundary-pushing antics take major courage. One of **Gleb Samoylov 's** most recent actions was to oppose the canonization of Pantera fan, rock star, and great actor Pyotr Mamonov. Mamonov, the **Zvuki Mu** singer, passed away onJuly 15th of Covid-19. **Gleb** has recently circumvented the pandemic by holding concerts on a boat. With **Agatha Christie** , he was known for nautically themed songs like Boarding/\u00ab\u0410\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0430\u0436,\u00bb \"Two Ships\"/\u00ab\u0414\u0432\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044f,\u00bb and \u00ab\u041c\u043e\u0440\u044f\u043a\u00bb/\"Sailor.\" These songs appear in **Matrixx** setlists, although **Gleb 's** current material is more aeronautically themed.Advertisement.

Critics have accused the Kinchev of antisemitism and xenophobia. Kinchev has denied these claims, which he has fought in court. **AlisA** has welcomed Jewish band members and plays for a diverse crowd. Beware: When our staff tried to infiltrate \"Kostya's\" concerts, our American passports earned us free beer from hospitable Russian patriots eager to converse. After all, Kinchev was inspired by western bands like **Black Sabbath**.It is true, nevertheless, that the blowhard singer repeatedly engages in controversial behavior. Authorities recently busted Kinchev for organizing an underground concert on the premises of a film studio under the pretext of shooting a video. The gathering was in violation of coronavirus regulations. Rather than apologizing, Kinchev voiced a call for help from both sides of his mouth. Kinchev, who was born on 25 December 1958, released a video stating that he is old and will continue to sing and play the guitar no matter what happens. The real question is will the government have to intervene to force the musician to stop taking off his shirts? Kinchev doesn\u2019t always begin his concerts shirtless, but if he doesn\u2019t end the night that way there may be a problem. In all fairness, Kinchev's decision to support the rights of non-vaccinated concert-goers has been replicated by **Eric Clapton**. **AlisA** currently has sold-out concerts scheduled.Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading. **AlisA 's **fan club is called the **AlisA** Army. **AlisA** concerts have a reputation for being insanely electrifying. Fans work their way into a fist-pumping frenzy like no others. This is not all done in good cheer. **AlisA** concerts are also known to become extremely violent. At a 2019 show, a Latvian journalist was beaten so badly that he was left disabled. Accidents have also occurred at **Alisa 's **shows as a result of illegal pyrotechnics.In other respects, Kinchev's reputation is wholesome. He received his degree in economics from Moscow Institute of Technology. Kinchev is often portrayed as a modest man, who rides the subway, and practically lives in ragged cut-off jean shorts when the weather permits. Konstantin had three children. His daughter Vera is a Moscow Art Theatre-trained actress. Vera has worked on both the stage and the screen. Vera certainly caused bewilderment when she appeared as a nun in the play version of _Kant 's Critique of Pure Reason _at the Mayakovsky Theatre. As a child, Vera got her start in entertainment when she starred in **AlisA 's** \u00ab\u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u00bb/\u201cMotherland\u201d music video.Do you believe the hype?

The stakes were high for Martin, as the project would mark his first oceanfront development.The property, on the northern border of Miami Beach next to Surfside, was not designated historic. And less than a year after the 2013 purchase, a Martin-led entity hammered out an agreement with the city of Miami Beach that increased the project\u2019s footprint, expanding it closer to the Surfside border and just feet from Champlain Towers South.Publicly, plans also changed: Now Martin\u2019s development firm, Terra, and its partners would build a luxury condo tower called Eighty Seven Park on the hotel site. Opposition, delays and questions regarding the proximity of the building and the effects of its construction on Champlain Towers South would follow, years before the collapse of the Surfside tower next door.As part of the deal with Miami Beach, the company developing Eighty Seven Park, 8701 Collins Development LLC, agreed to pay the city a voluntary contribution of $10.5 million, tied to Miami Beach giving up 87th Terrace, a 50-foot-wide street separating the adjacent properties.Some believe the land was transferred to the developer in a way that violated the city charter.Preservationists opposed the demolition of the Morris Lapidus-designed hotel, as well as the vacation, or ceding, of 87th Terrace. Residents of Champlain Towers South didn\u2019t like that Miami Beach was giving up the street and its public parking.Construction of the Renzo Piano-designed Eighty Seven Park at 8701 Collins Avenue reverberated next door, causing Champlain Towers South to shake, according to residents\u2019 accounts cited in lawsuits and interviews, and 8701 Collins Development is named among defendants in lawsuits filed by survivors and family members of victims after the collapse.Though the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s investigation into the June collapse of Champlain Towers South is ongoing, engineers, architects and other experts have said the construction of Eighty Seven Park did not cause the fall. Champlain Towers South had a number of major structural issues that went unaddressed for years.But residents were worried even prior to construction of Eighty Seven Park about the condo project\u2019s impact on their aging building.\u201cWe\u2019re concerned that where before we had the street as the buffer from the existing lot, now that the city has sold that to the developer, it brings the action so much closer to our building,\u201d said Champlain Towers South unit owner Alberto Manrara during a March 2015 Miami Beach Design Review Board meeting.Manrara sold his sixth-floor apartment, which overlooked Eighty Seven Park, in April, just two months before the northeast portion of Champlain came crashing down in the middle of the night on June 24, killing 98 people.In a statement, 8701 Collins Development said that \u201cconstruction of Eighty Seven Park did not cause or contribute\u201d to the collapse, and that the calamity was caused \u201cby factors wholly unrelated to the construction of Eighty Seven Park.\u201dMartin and Terra declined to comment through a spokesperson.In 2019, Terra, alongside Bizzi & Partners, equity investor New Valley and other partners, completed Eighty Seven Park, where the most expensive unit, a penthouse, sold for $37 million last October.Since the collapse, Martin, who has worked hard to build his reputation as a sustainable developer, has been laying low. The Coconut Grove-based company he leads with his father, Pedro Martin, stopped promoting its projects throughout Miami-Dade and Broward counties. That includes a luxury condo it is building, alongside developer Russell Galbut, at the entrance to South Beach, and a new mixed-use office project in Bay Harbor Islands.Peter Zalewski, a condo market consultant and investor, said Martin was in \u201cacquisition mode\u201d at the beginning of the last cycle. He and his father founded Terra in 2001, but the company has grown dramatically over the past decade, building Quantum on the Bay, 900 Biscayne Bay, Grove at Grand Bay and a number of projects in suburban cities such as Doral and Pembroke Pines.In 2013, Martin called developer Gil Dezer, whose family owned the Dezerland site, requesting a tour, Dezer said. The Terra-led entity ended up buying it, allowing the Dezers to make a huge profit.Champlain Towers South and the adjacent 87th Terrace property before\u201cHe built a very expensive building there. We didn\u2019t see the values he saw,\u201d said Dezer, whose family paid about $7 million for the property in the late 1980s, a few years after Champlain Towers South was built. Terra purchased it for $65 million.At the time Terra was negotiating the purchase of the Dezerland, the developer was building Glass, an 18-story luxury condo building in South Beach. In 2020, the Glass condo association sued the developer, contractor John Moriarty & Associates and subcontractors over a litany of alleged construction defects. Moriarty also built Eighty Seven Park.Years earlier, in 2014, associations at Quantum on the Bay also sued an affiliate of Terra, alleging the developer cut corners during construction of the nearly 700-unit development.Miami Beach\u2019s code requires that voters approve any sale of city-owned waterfront land.But the Terra-led 8701 Collins Development LLC, which acquired 87th Terrace from the city, did not have to get residents\u2019 approval. The loophole came in the form of a 12,000-square-foot sandy plot of land sandwiched between 87th Terrace and the beachfront. The original survey of the land, dated June 1919 and signed by early Miami Beach developer J.H. Tatum, identifies it as one of many tracts now owned by Miami-Dade Public Works.The city\u2019s analysis of its charter, as part of its agreement with the Eighty Seven Park developer, found the same. Spanning just over 18,000 square feet, 87th Terrace is not oceanfront. The city found that vacating the plot of land or right of way served a public purpose by enhancing pedestrian access to the beach, increasing property taxes and beautifying North Shore Open Space Park, which is immediately south of Eighty Seven Park.Street or alley vacations are common across the country, experts say. Attorney Keith Poliakoff, managing partner of Fort Lauderdale-based Government Law Group, said the alleys or dead-end streets no longer serve the purpose of housing utilities that they had when municipalities mapped them out years ago.But critics of such actions say the process results in a giveaway to developers. In South Florida, residents have increasingly spoken out against them. The Coral Gables commission recently rejected plans for a mixed-use development downtown as a result of an overwhelming public outcry, due in part to a proposed vacation of an alley.\u201cWe feel extremely strongly that vacations of city right of ways shouldn\u2019t be happening without going through a voter referendum, as it is in the city charter,\u201d said Tanya Bhatt, past and acting president of Miami Beach United, a volunteer activist organization.Land use attorney Gloria Velazquez, a shareholder at the law firm Nason Yeager, called the Miami Beach agreement unusual because it tied the vacation to the $10.5 million voluntary contribution, instead of the overall project approval. Another attorney said the development agreement was \u201cterribly worded\u201d by suggesting the $10.5 million was a payment for the vacation.The vacation, in the form of a perpetual easement, allowed the Terra-led entity to take over most of the alley. It left space for a pedestrian walkway to the boardwalk and beach that the developer built and was responsible for maintaining, eventually handing maintenance over to the condo association. The Eighty Seven Park condo tower, which has an underground parking garage, is on the southern half of the oceanfront lot.Eighty Seven Park\u2019s construction was delayed early on. Generally, project delays are common, the result of a combination of overambitious developers, a longer-than-expected financing timeline, and a push for positive publicity.In the case of Eighty Seven Park, the developer\u2019s LLC financed more than 90 percent of the $65 million purchase with a loan. When 8701 Collins Development sought demolition approval of the Dezerland, instead of a restoration, North Beach residents protested.They called the change a \u201cbait and switch,\u201d said Daniel Ciraldo, head of the Miami Design Preservation League. A lawsuit filed in 2016 by a debt brokerage seeking a commission from the developer shows a Terra affiliate planned to redevelop the site before it had even closed on the 2013 acquisition.The vacation resolution and the development agreement with the city of Miami Beach were finalized in 2014. The developer would be in talks with the Champlain Towers South residents and its association years later.As part of the agreement, 8701 Collins Development LLC was required to receive a full building permit by Sept. 3, 2016. That month, the developer requested a one-year extension of the building permit deadline, citing the governor\u2019s declaration of a state of emergency over the Zika outbreak.Once construction was finally underway in 2017, residents of the adjacent Surfside tower, who were likely aware of problems with their building, were again voicing their concerns about Eighty Seven Park.At a February 2018 Miami Beach Design Review Board meeting, the city postponed a vote on modifications to the site plan and approval. Attorneys for Eighty Seven Park and the group of Champlain residents who were concerned about the project spoke in favor of the continuance to the following month. In March 2018, the Terra-led entity withdrew its request, which dealt with perimeter walls and fences, according to a recording of the meeting.In emails sent to the town of Surfside, Champlain Towers South board member Mara Chouela complained that residents were \u201cconcerned that the construction next to Surfside is too close,\u201d including that the workers digging at Eighty Seven Park could be damaging the structure of Champlain.Developer Edgardo Defortuna, whose Fortune International Group has built and sold a number of high-end condo buildings in Miami-Dade, said in an interview with _The Real Deal_ in June that when it constructs a tower, Fortune will install a vibration monitoring device on nearby buildings to ensure that the work is being done safely.The crisis communications firm hired by Eighty Seven Park\u2019s developers after the collapse did not respond to a question about whether the developer installed such a device at Champlain, where residents said construction caused their units to shake.During construction, which involved digging piles deep into the site, debris was also landing in the pool and on the pool deck of Champlain, clogging up the driveway and front entrance with sand, emails show. Concrete trucks were illegally parking in a city-owned lot, according to emails between Terra and Miami Beach.The developer offered the Champlain Towers South association a $400,000 payment in 2019 if unit owners agreed not to publicly oppose the project and accept longer hours of construction, the Washington Post reported in July. But the association did not accept the settlement.The Champlain property manager wrote in an email exchange with Surfside that year that \u201cmoney doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue\u201d for the developer, suggesting Eighty Seven Park would pay the $5,000 fines for the debris and continue to allow workers to let it land at Champlain.After the collapse of Champlain Towers South, Eighty Seven Park remained closed for more than two and a half months to residents who did not sign waivers. It reopened in mid-August. The partial collapse and the controlled demolition of the rest of the Champlain building in early July created instability on the site that led that portion of Collins Avenue to remain closed for a much longer period than initially expected, out of fear that the street would cave in.The National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s investigation into the collapse involves going through the history of the building and town code, evidence reservation, geotechnical and structural engineering and more. An August Miami Herald investigation found that the original design was flawed, adding to damning structural and engineering reports that had already been made public by the town of Surfside. Investigators have said they will look at all possible causes and contributions to the collapse.\u201cYou have an old, antiquated building, and you have a brand-new tower with underground parking being built less than a street away,\u201d Zalewski said. \u201cIt would be impossible to not look at Eighty Seven Park\u2019s impact, if any, on the collapse of the tower.\u201dReprints & Permissions__Share on Facebook __Share on Twitter __Share on Linkedin __Share via Email __Share via ShortlinkShare via Shortlink87 ParkDavid MartinMiami BeachNorth BeachsurfsideSurfside condo collapseTerraTrouble in paradise?

Photo / SuppliedBy:  Anne GibsonProperty editor, NZ HeraldNow is the right time to list a new $931 million commercial landlord owning Auckland and Wellington office buildings in spite of Covid and lockdowns, a real estate chief says.Philip Littlewood, chief executive of Stride Property Group which plans to list the new 10-building owning landlord Fabric Property, said despite the pandemic and its effects, the new company's portfolio was different from any other NZX business.Stride wants to raise $250 million in the initial public offering, floating off commercial buildings from its existing company into the new vehicle. Stride shareholders will get one share in Fabric for every four they own in Stride.\"These buildings are high quality, with 77 per cent of the $931m portfolio being either prime or grade A, an average age across the whole portfolio of only 10.5 years and with a long weighted average lease term of 7.2 years, but most importantly the portfolio has one of highest sustainability ratings in the sector, with 68 per cent of the portfolio being rated as Green Assets,\" he said.  * Stride Property Group profit up 420%, buying new $152m office block - NZ Herald  * Surprise new NZX listing in $250m IPO: Fabric Property planned to trade from next month - NZ He...  * Stride Property Group branches into funds management, adds $650m assets - NZ Herald\"The markets are highly supportive of Stride's new offering. That's the feedback we're getting,\" Littlewood said.Asked how the market would receive the offer, Littlewood said: \"We've been signalling this for some time. From the perspective of the offer, we think the portfolio is heading in a direction for the future with its high quality and strong green rating credentials.\"Asked how Covid could affect such a deal, he said: \"It did have an impact last year because there was a lot of uncertainty around people's jobs and whether businesses would survive. However, what we observed was that when the lockdowns finished, everyone got back to work. The economy was relatively resilient but also people wanted to get back into the office. That was our experience.\"There was a lot of sub-lease space very quickly taken up or withdrawn as businesses realised changes would not be as dramatic as initially thought. We've been doing leasing over this lockdown period because people are confident they'll come out the other side.\"Advertise with NZME.He explained how Stride got to this point. The story goes back around six years ago when we first looked to establish a new strategy for what was then DNZ, the name Stride was known as previously, he said.\"Around 2015, we rebranded the business from DNZ to Stride Property Group and set our new strategy to build an entirely new funds management business.\"### Surprise new property business to list in $250m IPO13 Sep, 2021 05:20 AMQuick Read### NZ sharemarket ends week on quiet note10 Sep, 2021 05:52 AMQuick Read### Market close: NZ sharemarket's stellar run comes to a halt8 Sep, 2021 05:50 AMQuick Read### Small cap stocks impress as sharemarket rises7 Sep, 2021 05:40 AMQuick ReadStride's Philip Littlewood explained why the new company was being listed. Photo / SuppliedThe company then had $896m of assets and today has assets valued at around $3.6b based on committed acquisitions and developments, he said.It has grown more than 400 per cent in the last seven years.\"One of the things we decided to do was to build sector-specific funds management business.\"There are four core commercial sectors: office, industrial and retail but we saw the latter being split into shopping centres and large-format retail. We saw those two as quite different.\"That was an opportunity for Stride to provide a different offer to what had been either diversified investment vehicles listed on the NZX or a selected few sector-specific vehicles like Precinct Properties who I used to work for 20 years ago.Large-format retail was established from Stride in the form of Investore, launched in July 2016.Advertise with NZME.\"That company grew from owning assets valued at $640m at its IPO to more than $1b today, he said.In 2019, Stride agreed to establish a wholesale fund in partnership with JP Morgan Asset Management, specialising in the industrial sector and launched Industre. That business is not traded on the NZX separately.The fund was established in 2020.Industre had properties valued at about $300m when it was established last year but it was on track to own properties worth $693m later this year, Littlewood said.\"Since then, Stride has been focused on building a portfolio of office properties in preparation for the establishment of its next sector-specific fund and that is Fabric Property,\" he said.The PDS showed the Deloitte Building in Wellington will be Fabric's most valuable, worth $230m, followed closely by the new Mansons TCLM-developed block on Newmarket's Carlton Gore Rd.Fabric's Auckland portfolio is to be:\u2022 The under-development Mansons' office building at 110 Carlton Gore Rd being bought for $217.5m in 2023;\u2022 The $152m building at 46 Sale St;\u2022 $63.7m office block at 34 Shortland St;\u2022 $27.3m block at 21-25 Teed St;\u2022 $22.5m block at 80 Grays Ave;\u2022 $24.3m block at 35 Teed St;\u2022 7-9 Fanshawe St valued at $11.1m.The Wellington portfolio is to be:\u2022 22 The Terrace, valued at $32.4m;\u2022 20 Customhouse Quay valued at $230m;\u2022 1 Gray St, valued at $65.1m.All properties are fee simple, freehold titles except 7-9 Fanshawe St, on a ground lease and 34 Shortland St, a unit titled property.Fabric owns units on 13 of the 17 levels of the Shortland St building. It controls key decisions of the body corporate for this property through its 85.9 per cent ownership interest, the PDS said.Stride said it expects Fabric to begin trading from October 6.Advertise with NZME.### The NZX-listed company offering $150 for staff to get Covid jab14 Sep, 2021 06:31 AM3 minutes to read### National calls for more Auckland business support14 Sep, 2021 05:40 AM4 minutes to read### Grocer's dilemma: Choose some change now, or risk more radical change later14 Sep, 2021 05:38 AM6 minutes to read### F&P Healthcare drives down NZ sharemarket14 Sep, 2021 05:35 AM4 minutes to read### NZSA backs New Talisman outsider for board seat14 Sep, 2021 05:33 AM4 minutes to read### Missing Otorohanga family: Searchers using drones with thermal imaging tonight14 Sep, 2021 10:26 AM4 minutes to read### Spring Hill Corrections Facility prisoner starts fire in cell14 Sep, 2021 09:29 AM2 minutes to read### Mystery cases: What we know about the cases keeping Auckland in lockdown14 Sep, 2021 09:00 AM8 minutes to readAdvertise with NZME.About NZMEHelp & SupportContact UsSubscribe to NZ HeraldHouse RulesManage Your Print SubscriptionNZ Herald E-EditionAdvertise with NZMEBook Your AdPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseCompetition Terms & ConditionsSubscriptions Terms & Conditions\u00a9 Copyright 2020 NZME Publishing Limited"}

The US audiobook market is estimated to be worth US$1.1 billion annually and is growing at a rate of more than 10% each year. Industry insiders say this is a fresh market, with 37% of Australian audiobook listeners only taking up the habit in the last year.Audiobook downloads (up 15% on the previous year) were part of a pandemic boost for publisher revenues. Some are read by the authors themselves or by famous actors including Elizabeth Moss and Tom Hanks.But are listeners really reading? If we challenge what we think we know about reading, audiobooks can be seen as not just a cheat\u2019s shortcut for catching up on classics and bestsellers, but a new way to engage more people with stories._**Read more:How reading aloud can be an act of seduction ** _Audiobooks are not new. The term refers to any authored print book vocalised through a variety of technologies \u2014 from records through to cassette players, and CDs. Digitally downloaded or streamed audiobooks have added a new dimension to this heritage technology, traditionally viewed as a compensatory tool for visual impairment or reading difficulties such as dyslexia and the rarer condition of alexia.The surge in audiobook sales is likely a halo effect of the huge popularity of podcasts. But audiobooks are single-voiced, immersive listening experiences. Audiobooks do not include book-length texts \u201cread\u201d by an automated voice.Audible (owned by Amazon) dominates the audiobook market and is now getting into the \u201coriginal audiobook\u201d game, meaning they produce the audio version rather than a book publisher. Other services offer \u201cborn audio\u201d productions. Storytel Originals bypass print as the starting point in the traditional book publishing cycle.Librivox \u2014 a site dedicated to making \u201call books in the public domain available, narrated by real people and distributed for free\u201d emerged from a group of friends reading aloud from Joseph Conrad\u2019s The Secret Agent. It draws its 15,000 titles from Project Gutenburg\u2019s 60,000 free ebooks.Unlike the commercial services, with narration and soundscapes on par with radio drama productions, the quality of Librivox audiobooks is highly variable. There are excellent recordings and \u201creadings that sound as if they come from your worst nightmare of community theatre \u2014 either monotone or way over the top\u201d, according to one LA Times reviewer.Audiobooks are different to podcasts because they are voiced by one person and are immersive listening experiences. Unsplash, CC BYReading is a complex process. Rather than a single cognitive act of decoding, we know from imaging technologies that reading engages several discrete actions within the brain\u2019s visual region. When the reader encounters an irregular letter-sound relationship, neurologist Stanislas Dehaene tells us the auditory brain region fires up as well.When reading, we engage a bundle of brain skills that have evolved over centuries if not millennia. A recent study used fMRI scans to show people generate word meaning in the same way whether they see it or hear it.Though reading is still usually thought of as a stationary, silent and solo practice, there is a long tradition of reading communally and aloud. This is not only reading by adults to children, but also among adults.Streamed audiobooks available through smartphones enable reading-as-listening while mobile. The kinetic dimension of reading-as-listening while moving through space, commuting, walking or while driving is yet to be fully understood.How moving while listening affects our reading experience is yet to be fully understood.

The Reading the reader report from Macquarie University found that more than 60% of \u201cfrequent readers\u201d are women. Of \u201cnon-readers\u201d, three quarters are men. Yet, men and women are equally likely to consume digital format books such as ebooks and audiobooks. Audiobooks may inspire more male readers to participate in bookclubs, which traditionally involve more women than men.Reading on the tram or train.

Princeton University Press recently announced the release of their PUB audio series, signalling new educational formats for scholars and students.Rather than being one act for one purpose, literacy researcher Sam Duncan argues reading is a bigger umbrella than we may have previously realised, under which sits a diversity of practices, involving different \u201cskills, challenges and pleasures\u201d.Listening-as-reading to vocalisations of books enables a level of imaginative and affective engagement that should not be diminished by our traditional assumptions.## Here are three great books to listen to:The audiobook of Alexis Wright\u2019s epic Carpentaria, is narrated by Noongar actor and dramaturg Isaac Drandich. Using a range of voices, he offers the reader-as-listener an enhanced experience.Reading his own book, Kim Scott\u2019s gentle voice animates his sparse prose style beautifully.The novel dramatises a brutal past event and its present day reckoning.## 3\\.

As animationexpress reported, the activity involving Storytel was carried out under the Mom & Me Time initiative of Sony Yay! and aimed at highlighting how reading out stories to the kids can be a fulfilling exercise for them.The activity involved letting the kids savor a video series comprising of three videos based on stories Storytel has to offer. These include _Jandharv_ , _The Blue Jackal_ , _The Monkey & The Crocodile_, and _Buddhuraj, the Foolish Lion_ with the stories narrated by none other than the legendary actor, Naseeruddin Shah.Then there was the art genius Lalon who too chipped in and created DIY stuff, something that the young minds are easily drawn to. Apart from these, there were other activities as well where the kids got to hone their socializing skills as well as their smartness. These include a dance session by Shiamak Davar's Institute for the Performing Arts while other activities performed include Yoga by Yoga Zoo, Storytelling by Little Reader's Nook, and science sessions by Science Utsav.The three videos, meanwhile went on to garner more than 820K impressions, which can be a nice indicator of their popularity. The fun activity presents a win-win situation for both Sony Yay! and Storytel, with the latter playing hosts to more than 20,000 stories targeted at the kids. In any case, Storytel is easily counted among the largest eBook and audiobook streaming service providers in the world and competes with the likes of Amazon-owned Audible.Sony Yay!, on the other hand, is owned by Sony Pictures Networks India and has almost everything to offer that can make kids happy. Those include shows and movies, games, interactive activities, along with plenty more. The company takes pride in describing itself as a one-stop destination for happiness for kids throughout the country and beyond as well.Sovan Mandal( Senior Writer )With a keen interest in tech, I make it a point to keep myself updated on the latest developments in the world of technology and gadgets. That includes smartphones or tablet devices but stretches to even AI and self-driven automobiles as well, the latter being my latest fad. Besides writing, I like watching videos, reading, listening to music, or experimenting with different recipes. Motion picture is another aspect that interests me a lot and maybe I'll make a film sometime in the future.Filed Under: Audiobook News, E-Book News  * ######  Amazon will only provide at least 4 years of security updates on the KindleAugust 26, 2021By Michael Kozlowski | 6 Comments  * ######  These are all of the new e-readers that are coming out in 2021August 19, 2021By Michael Kozlowski | 6 Comments  * ######  You will soon be able to buy-now-pay-later for an Amazon KindleAugust 27, 2021By Michael Kozlowski | 6 Comments  * ######  Upcoming Oppo tablet will serve as a smart ecosystem hubAugust 27, 2021By Sovan Mandal  * ######  Amazon introduces new Home Screen on the KindleAugust 17, 2021By Michael Kozlowski | 15 Comments  * ######  Will the Kindle Paperwhite 5 have a 6.8 inch screen?September 9, 2021By Michael Kozlowski | 16 CommentsCopyright (C) 2021 Good e-Reader Inc. - Privacy Policy \\- Terms of Use  \\- Shipping and Return Policy \\- Customer Service"}

The most successful brands such as Amazon, Kobo and Barnes and Noble have design and engineering teams that construct the device and do mockups of how it will look and outsource the manufacturing process to trusted providers. Smaller companies tend to white label existing products or do limited production runs and run crowd funding campaigns. Nobody really knows how the global supply chain for e-readers actually works, and Good e-Reader seeks to give you a firm understanding. **It 's been E INK all along! **The vast majority of e-Readers that are currently being sold and have historically been on the market, at one point or another, have all had E INK displays. E INK is a company based in Taiwan and they have three factories that product the EPD displays. E INK also spends hundreds of million of dollars, spread out over a couple of years on research and development. This has led to modern creations such as the E INK Carta 1200, Carta 1250, E INK Kaleido 1 and Kaleido 2 and alas various prototypes such as a foldable e-Reader. E INK currently operates their largest factory in Yangzhou, eastern China and smaller ones in Taiwan and Hanover in the United States. E INK will basically create the EPD, front-light/color temperature system and touchscreen layer, which includes WACOM. Next, they send the EPD panels and screen related tech to various OEM's who will take the EPD and source the other components such as the battery, logic board, processor, memory and then assemble it into the chassis.One of the pitfalls of having one company, with very little competition in the EPD space, is that a supply constraint can affect the entire industry. Pretty well in all of 2021 there has been an EPD shortage, which is why many products are sold out or some aren't being made at all. The main reason of the EPD shortage is primarily attributed to their factory in Yangzhou, eastern China, which has been impacted by a reoccurrence of coronavirus pandemic. The local government took strict measures to control traffic and people's mobility, and consequently, production at the factory has decreased a great deal, E INK CEO Johnson Lee noted. In addition to reduced production, many shipments from the factory have been deferred. After the local government lifts the control, E Ink will make the most efforts to hike production and clean deferred shipments. It is not estimated when this is happening, but E INK expects it sometime in November or December, but this is optimistic.So what is the big deal about one factory in China? This is their largest factory, this is where the vast majority of ALL of their EPD displays are manufactured. Their only other factories are in Linkou Taiwan and S. Hadley in the United States, but they are smaller. At various points in the past few years, E INK has made continued promises to expand their production lines at the factories outside of China, but it has not occurred yet. At a recent earnings report, the CEO stated that E Ink complete the first additional production line by the end of 2021 and the second additional one in 2022, Lee noted. However, E Ink will not expand production capacity for e-paper modules for the time being, but will automate such production lines. The two expansions are not going to be cheap, they will cost around $53 million USD, instead of the expected $35 million USD.While the cost for components and materials rose continually in the first half of 2021, E Ink has not hiked quotes to reflect increases in cost because E Ink aims to expand the e-paper market. But if such cost further rises in the second half of 2021, E Ink is likely to upward adjust quotes for e-paper modules. This might result in only bigger companies being able to release new products and smaller ones, might not be able to make the added cost work out. **How do e-readers get designed and manufactured?** **Amazon** is the largest and most successful e-Reader brand in the world, everyone has heard of a Kindle. When people ask what I do for a living and explain about e-readers, mostly everyone has read something about it. In the early days, Amazon executives designed the first generation Kindle and ever since then, their secretive research and development arm, Lab126 has designed every single Kindle since 2011. They spend months or even years developing various Kindle models, creating plastic molds to see what design works or not. Once something has been signed off by the executive team, various engineers take the CAD files and molds to Foxconn, which is one of the largest manufacturing plants in China, they are the ones that make the iPhone. **Kobo** is the global number two player in the e-Reader industry and thanks to selling the company to Rakuten, they have been expanding their workforce, hiring tons of coders, engineers and designers. Kobo does the research and development for all Kobo e-readers ever made and creates the design, mockups and CAD files. The actual manufacturing is done at Netronix, which is based in Taiwan. Kobo also designs all of the Tolino e-readers for the German market, this is why all of the modern Tolino devices all look the same as the Kobo variants.Netronix also does their own in-house designs and creates white labels for trusted partners such as King Jim, Mobiscribe and Readmoo Mooink. Barnes and Noble used to have a research and development studio in Santa Clara, but they scuttled the division in 2014, when they tried to cut down on costs. They have limited say in Nook development, but do contribute designs.There is a company called **Linfiny** that is based in Japan, which manufacturers and designs e-readers. This company was a co-branded partnership between E INK and Sony. They basically have their own factory and provide an all-in-one solution for the entire contraction of an e-Reader, they do the designs, assembly and  production. The Sony Digital Paper DPT-RP1, Digital Paper DPT-CP1, QuirkLogic Papyr and Fujitsu Quaderno line were all produced at this location. The way Linfiny works,  is that Sony does the design and E INK runs the production lines. **Onyx Boox** is one of the best emerging brands in the world. They used to focus exclusively develop e-readers and e-notes in China, and 4 years ago decided to focus on the international market, which has been the key to their success. All of their executive team is based in China. They create and assemble their own devices and also run their own factory. The company also provides a white label service, for companies that can't afford to do something from scratch. They used to deal with Icarus, before they went bankrupt, they also have created all of the Storytel readers. **Pocketbook** is one of the strongest e-Reader brands and have been in business since 2011. They primarily focus on consumer electronics and have been releasing a couple of new devices, every year. They are not adverse at taking risks and were early adopters of crude color E INK, called Triton. The company designs all of their e-readers in-house, but the actual manufacturing process is done by Jezetek, who is a little-known mobile device subsidiary of a Hong Kong-based electronics firm.  You won't find any products on their website, but they are a fixture of tradeshows all across Asia. It is unknown if Jezetek is the manufacturer for the Boyue Likebook series and Bookeen, but since the factory scene for E INK devices is very small,  it would make sense. **Bigme** is a Chinese company that has created around 3 different digital note taking devices. The actual manufacturing is done by an unknown 3rd party. The company white labels their products for Pinenote, GUOYUE, and the Bookeen Notia.It is currently unknown if Wisky, Reinkstone, and Topjoy are the same company, since they use similar broken English on all of their websites and some of the same staff work for all three. Reinkstone and Topjoy both charged uses a couple of dollars to secure a unit, before they started Crowdfunding campaigns. I asked all 3 if they were the same company, but they said no. A trusted supplier told me that they are all within a 3 or 4 block radius and they did not have a good feeling about their manufacturing process, because they are small scale. **Supernote** burst on the scene a couple of years ago with a series of digital note taking devices and digital stationary, such as unique cases and stylus. The company designs all of their devices themselves, but their first gen and second generation models use the same shell, just different internal components. They have told me that they do all of the RND, and designing themselves and outsource it to an unknown factory in China, where everything is mass produced. Supernote is also a partner of the Digital Stationary Consortium, which includes members such as Wacom, Samsung, iFlytek, E INK, Linfiny, Lamy and a series of others. Likely all of these companies do the manufacturing process at Linfiny/E INK's Chinese factory. **Remarkable  **is based in Norway and has only been around for a handful of years. They have experienced tremendous success in North America and in Europe for their first and second generation writing tablets. Remarkable designed the devices and also the cases, stylus in-house and outsourced the manufacturing process to an unknown Chinese factory. It had to be a smaller factory that accepted low MOQ. The Remarkable 2 ran a staggered release campaign, where people would pay for the devices and they would be shipped within 3-4 months of their order. Remarkable would use this money to produce a limited batch run and then ship it those early customers. They did this for about 8-9 months of the release and now have a stable supply.Michael Kozlowski( Editor in Chief )Michael Kozlowski has been writing about audiobooks and e-readers for the past twelve years.

As reported on Reddit, Ighor July attempted to recover some of his deleted GeForce Now titles and ended up finding more than he bargained for. Those listed games include _Kingdom Hearts IV,_ a new _BioShock_ title, a couple of _Tomb Raider_ anniversary games, and even more PlayStation Studios titles destined for PC.The database includes everything the company uses for testing, and the list of 18,000 titles includes many that have yet to be revealed. _Titan Quest 2_ and a new _Outcast_ game will reportedly be unveiled at the THQ Nordic showcase on September 17, but some of the other titles that Reddit users have managed to find are:Despite its age, the six-month old database also mentioned the existence of the recently revealed _Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection_ _._ Other PlayStation Studios titles included _God of War_ , _Returnal,_ and _Demon\u2019s Souls_ , none of which have been mentioned for PC before now. A recent Sony presentation had stated they were planning to bring more of their games to PC so this comes as no surprise, if it does indeed end up being true. Despite previous rumors, there was no mention of a PC version of _Bloodborne_, and _Spider-Man_ is also conspicuously absent from the leaked list.It\u2019s worth mentioning that everything in this list needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Not only does the list of 18,000 titles include genuine games, it also includes placeholder names for testing and projects that might even have been cancelled since the database was created. There\u2019s a chance that nothing on this list is genuine, although admittedly that\u2019s unlikely. Still, for the time being it\u2019s best to consider this a rumor, and remember that none of these titles are officially confirmed until the publishers and developers themselves reveal them to be so.[Source: Ighor July via Reddit]Tags: Bioshock, Cities: Skylines, crysis, Demon's Souls, Destroy All Humans!, Dragon's Dogma 2, Earth Defense Force, God of War, Hangar 13, Helldivers, Hitman, Human Fall Flat, Kingdom Hearts IV, Metro, Monster Hunter, Outcast, Resident Evil 4, Respawn, Returnal, Sniper Elite 5, The Talos Principle 2, Titan Quest, Tomb Raider, Worms, WreckfestShare this article on facebookSHAREShare this article on twitterTWEETEvolve Media LLCPlayStationLifeStyle is a property of Evolve Media Holdings, LLC.

THQ Nordic Announces Celebration Plans For Their Tenth Anniversary# THQ Nordic Announces Celebration Plans For Their Tenth AnniversaryPosted on September 4, 2021 by Gavin SheehanTHQ Nordic will be celebrating a specific milestone soon as they have plans to enjoy their tenth anniversary with something special. It really kinda feels like yesterday when Nordic games managed to acquire a number of properties, specifically the THQ titles and name in 2013, to turn itself into the company it is today. Which is kind of entertaining to think about as that's how a good chunk of their library has been formed by taking old or retired IP's and bringing them back to life with new content or remastered editions. Not to take anything away from their original titles that have done well over the years and established the company as we know it today. To mark the occasion, they'll be throwing a special live stream event with **Geoff Keighley** , in which they will be announcing several new games and going in-depth on a couple that you've already heard about. We have a few more details and the teaser trailer for it here as it will take place September 17th at 12pm PT.Credit: THQ Nordic> The showcase will be hosted by Geoff Keighley, executive producer and host of The Game Awards, and will feature six new game announcements that will take you on a journey through time and space. Witness the return of legendary franchises, including some for which fans have been waiting decades to get their hands on a new installment, and you can also expect to see sequels to beloved games. We hope you are ready, kids! We also plan to release new information and footage for Open-World-Sci-Fi-Fantasy _RPG ELEX II_ , and upcoming CRPG _Expeditions: Rome_ will join the show to demo the latest and greatest gameplay! If you tune in a few minutes earlier, you can also get a glimpse of what our friends at HandyGames have been working on lately in the pre-show.Video can't be loaded because JavaScript is disabled: 10 Years of THQ Nordic (https://youtu.be/WHho7aGg0bo)Posted in: Games, THQ Nordic, Video Games | Tagged: anniversary, THQ Nordic**Enjoyed this?

It is further alleged that the suspect then fled the scene and proceeded to his ex-girlfriend\u2019s place of employment on Alexandra Terrace. On arrival, the suspect fired several shots at the woman and ran away,\u201d added Langa.Langa stated that the 25-year-old victim was critically injured and was transported to a hospital where she remained in a critical condition.The suspect then drove to his homestead in Matimatolo, Greytown, Langa said.Langa said the suspect was intercepted by police and a shoot-out occurred and the man died.\u201cIpid is investigating his death and a post-mortem will be conducted and more statements will be collected.\u201dKZN provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker also confirmed the incident and said police were investigating six counts of murder and one count of attempted murder.A relative of the deceased, who asked not to be named, said the family were all sitting in their home when the suspect entered the house.The relative said the incident had left them with a lot of questions that no one could answer at this stage.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what got into him. For now, we are just hoping and hoping that the person in the hospital will get better soon so that she can at least brief us about what happened.\u201cThe sad part is that when she wakes up, she will have to face the depressing news that her son has passed away. So this is just too much for everyone and the situation is still tense at the moment,\u201d she said.KwaZulu-Natal Social Development spokesperson Mhlabunzima Memela said that it was shocking that after so many campaigns that the government had embarked on to bring awareness and call for an end to gender-based violence, such brutal incidents were still happening.He said there were several options available to people to deal with their problems.\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that every time we talk about people getting murdered, we always speak about women and children,\u201d said Memela.Memela added that the department would assign social workers to assist the bereaved families through this difficult time.SAPSCrime and courtsShare this article:\u00a9 2021 Independent Online and affiliated companies.

Today, however, we're learning that the reveal events aren't quite over yet. Not only did Sony confirm details of the next PlayStation Showcase earlier today, but now THQ Nordic has announced a reveal event of its own.Specifically, this event will be held for THQ Nordic's 10th anniversary and will be hosted by Geoff Keighley, a person we've seen a lot of over this past summer. The event is slated to kick off at 12 PM PDT/3 PM EDT on September 17th, with THQ Nordic streaming it on YouTube, Twitch, and even Steam.> To celebrate our 10th anniversary, we are throwing a digital party!> Join us for the first, official THQ Nordic digital showcase event on September 17th at 9 pm CEST / 12 PM PST / 8 PM BST / 10 PM MSK on YouTube, Twitch, and Steam. pic.twitter.com/V6PG3Y7k4d> -- THQ Nordic (@THQNordic) September 2, 2021In follow-up tweets, THQ Nordic says that the event will feature six new games. \"Withness the return of legendary franchises and sequels to beloved games,\" that tweet reads. \"We hope you're ready, kids!\" Obviously, we don't know what exactly those franchises are, but THQ Nordic has since clarified that new _TimeSplitters_ and _Red Faction_ games won't be on the docket, as those IPs are currently in the hands of sister companies Deep Silver and Koch Media, respectively.It's possible we could see new entries in the _Second Sight_ , _Risen_ , or even _Sacred_ franchises, but THQ Nordic is a company that owns a lot of IP so there are a ton of potential reveals that could happen. In subsequent tweets, THQ Nordic confirms that _Elex II_ and _Expeditions: Rome_ will be on the docket, so we can least expect those.Given the timing of this event, we wouldn't be surprised to see the reveal of something _Amalur_ -related, whether that's the upcoming Fatesworn expansion for _Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Recoking_ or an entirely new _Amalur_ game. We'll just have to tune in next week to see what THQ Nordic has in store, so stay tuned for more.  * It's official: Kingdoms of Amalur is being remastered  * Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning release date and new expansion confirmed  * Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning gets a surprise Nintendo Switch release dateMust Read Bits & Bytes  * ## Fortnite Chapter 2 - Season 8 arrives: All the major changes detailed  * ## 2022 Polestar 2 Single Motor First Drive: Lower EV price, bigger appeal  * ## The groundbreaking James Webb Space Telescope just got its launch date  * ## Sonos Beam (Gen 2) adds Dolby Atmos and HDMI eARC supportSep 14, 2021  * ## Porsche partners on a new plant to produce Synthetic Fuels in ChileSep 14, 2021  * ## Novitec Ferrari F8 Spider has an 802HP turbo V8 engineSep 14, 2021  * ## Amazon One contactless identification system lands at a popular concert venueSep 14, 2021  * ## Astronomers predict Supernova Requiem will reappear in 2037Sep 14, 2021Sep 13, 2021Sep 10, 2021  * ## Wyze Night Light Review: Deceptively classySep 6, 2021  * ## vivo iQOO 7 Legend ReviewSep 6, 2021  * ## Elegoo Mercury X Bundle Washing and Curing Machine Review: 3D printing essentialsSep 3, 2021About / Advertise / Tip Us / ContactEditorial Standards / Ethics Statement / Privacy Policy / Terms of Use  \u00a9 2005-2021 SlashGear, All Rights Reserved."}

Given the sell-out popularity of the Florida event, it seemed inevitable that the Disneyland Resort would eventually follow suit, but they never did.After the company rebooted the Halloween event in 2010, we were sure a Christmas version would follow within a year or two, but\u2026 crickets.Disneyland is debuting a new Merriest Nites event in November. Photo courtesy Disney.Seemingly out of the blue, the Disney Parks Blog last week announced Disney's Merriest Nites at Disneyland, a series of five after-hours parties in November and December.Disney describes the event as being \"6 holiday parties in one,\" with six themed areas inside the park, each with a Disney character host.  * **Victorian-Themed Party on Main Street, U.S.A.** - the host with the most, Mickey Mouse, invites you to the party of the year! Revel in the holiday spirit with marvelous snow moments and holly-jolly carolers singing some holiday favorites.  * **Feliz Navidad Party in Frontierland** - join Miguel from  _Coco_  for a jolly fiesta with lively music, dancing, and so much more.  * **New Orleans Holiday in New Orleans Square** - swing by this jazzy celebration hosted by Tiana and brimming with beads, beignets and bountiful holiday fun.  * **_Frozen_ -Themed Party in Fantasyland** - discover a flurry of festivities at a celebration featuring Elsa and her icy escapades--and plenty of heartwarming cheer.  * **Tropical Party in Adventureland** - delight in a holiday celebration with tropical flair hosted by the lovable Lilo and her mischievous pal, Stitch.  * **Tomorrowland Party in Tomorrowland** - party to infinity and beyond at this futuristic hoopla featuring Buzz Lightyear, a DJ, and more.The event will also include a performance of A Christmas Fantasy Parade, special photo opportunities, event-exclusive merchandise and food offerings, and appearances by Disney characters in their holiday finery.The Disney Parks Blog article also promised a special appearance by the Muppets on Main Street, with \"Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and their friends join in the fun, traveling in a special coach with Christmas carol sing-alongs.\"It doesn't appear that the holiday fireworks are part of this offering, though Disney does promise there will be \"snow moments\" on Main Street.Most attractions in the lands listed above will remain open, but Disney specifically notes that Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, Mickey's Toontown and Critter Country will be closed during the event.The events each run 8:00 p.m. to midnight, with theme park access available starting at 5:00 p.m. each night for event guests. Event dates and prices are listed below. One reader noted via Twitter, \"'School nights only, late nights, high price tag. [I don't know] who the target audience is but it sure isn't families with school age kids.\"**Dates and Times** | **Ticket Price**  Thursday, November 11 | $175  Tuesday, November 16 | $165  Tuesday, November 30 | $165  Tuesday, December 7 | $165  Thursday, December 9 | $165  Tickets go on sale via the Disneyland website no earlier than 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, September 14.With the Disneyland Resort now back in the after-hours event business, we're hoping for news about the Villains Nite and Star Wars Nite events, which had to be postponed due to the theme park closures in 2020. Visitors who had already purchased tickets to either (or both) of the sold-out events will automatically receive a ticket for the rescheduled event(s) once the events are rescheduled. However, anyone who purchased a ticket and prefers a refund can call (714) 781-4636 to request one.#### Mobile food ordering expands to new locationsLast month Disney introduced mobile ordering at three candy shops, and now a fourth location has been added to the list, making it even easier to pick up a sweet treat during your visit.Inside Disneyland park, you can now order candy apples, chocolate-covered marshmallows and crispy rice treats from the Hunny Spot at Pooh's Corner, in addition to the Main Street Candy Palace and Kitchen.Trolley Treats in Disney California Adventure also accepts mobile orders, including during the after-hours Oogie Boogie Bash. You can also grab a snack on your way back to your Disneyland hotel room by visiting Marceline's Confectionery in Downtown Disney.All four of these locations offer seasonal treats, so you can get your bat cookies, mummy marshmallow wands and Jack Skellington cake pops without waiting in line.#### Tickets available for Breakfast with Santa at CatalReservations are now open for the 2021 Breakfast with Santa events at Catal restaurant in Downtown Disney. Catal has extended the popular event this year, and will host the breakfast on eleven dates between November 27 and December 24.The event includes family-style breakfast at Catal restaurant in Downtown Disney, live entertainment, a photo opportunity with Santa Claus, and a personalized stocking and stuffed animal for each child.Brunch is served between 8:00 a.m. and 12:45. Tickets are $109.95 per adult and $49.95 per child ages 3 to 10. Children 2 and under are free, but must be counted in the party size.

However, anyone who purchased a ticket and prefers a refund can call (714) 781-4636 to request one.We also recommend checking the convention calendar at the Anaheim/Orange County Visitor and Convention Bureau website. When looking at that site, remember to note both the number of people and the number of rooms resulting from each convention. A gathering of 25,000 people booking few room nights (indicating most will be driving in to the area for their meeting) can impact traffic around the resort much more than a crowd of 25,000 staying in area hotels. Of course, that second group is going to make finding a hotel room more difficult (and possibly more expensive), so it's best to book your own room as early as possible if you see that a big convention is in town during your trip.Notable events at parks and attractions around Southern California. If you know of an event that should be listed here, please send us an e-mail.Disneyland prices as of February 2020.Note: MousePlanet does not edit past Updates to reflect price increases; for up-to-date prices, check the most recent Disneyland Resort Update. Several current promotions offer discounted admission to the Disneyland Resort. For your convenience, we have grouped the discount offers based on the number of days the tickets are valid. Check out the category that best matches the amount of time you plan to spend at the resort, and pick the offer that works best for you. And keep those tips coming--let us know if you find a better or different offer, so we can share it with other readers!This first section is a list of discounts on ticket-only purchases. Though it has become more common in recent years, Disneyland tickets are rarely offered at deep discounts unless you are a resident of Southern California or Northern Mexico. For residents outside that area, the best discounts available tend to be simple advance purchase discounts. If you know of any additional discounts, offers, promotions, or contests that should be listed in this section, drop us a line. Note, we are no longer listing offers from the Anaheim-Orange County Visitor & Convention Bureau, as their convenience fee negates any savings.Don't get scammed! Never buy tickets from an unofficial or secondary outlet, such as through eBay or Craigslist. Never rent or purchase tickets from people approaching you outside the gates stating they have remaining days or leftover tickets. This practice is against the terms of use for Disneyland admission, and may result in denial of entry. It is also common for criminals to shoplift inactivated Disney theme park tickets from supermarkets to resell them. There is no way to determine if these tickets are valid until you try to use them to enter the parks. Only purchase Disney theme park tickets directly from Disney, an authorized seller, or travel agency like MousePlanet travel partner Get Away Today.#### New!

These are offered at Disney-operated stores only, and selection may vary by location.Disney usually allows customers to purchase more than one of the offers in a qualifying transaction, so if you spend $40 or more you can buy both items currently available if you wish. If you're a passholder, the minimum purchase is calculated after your discount, and your discount does not apply to the promotional item.After ended the former annual passholder program and creating the Legacy Passholder designation earlier this year, the Disneyland Resort said it would continue some passholder benefits for Legacy Passholders, including merchandise and food & beverage discounts at participating shops, until a new program is announced. At press time, the discount has been extended through May 31, 2020, but we expect that will be extended even further.Legacy Passholders must show a digital discount ticket on their Disneyland app _along with their physical passport and valid photo ID_ to receive any applicable food or merchandise benefits, or to access passholder-only opportunities.Disney will automatically uploaded this digital discount ticket to the accounts of passholders who had previously linked their ticket to their Disneyland app. Passholders who had not previously linked their ticket to the Disneyland app must now do so, using a ticket code that was sent to them via email in March.If you had already linked your ticket but the digital discount ticket does not appear on your account, contact Passholder Member Services at (714) 781-4567 or use the chat feature in the Disneyland app for assistance.Visit the Legacy Annual Passholder discount page for specific details and exclusions.##### Disney Rewards VISA Credit Card HoldersSee the Disney Visa website for terms and conditions for all of these promotions.Disney Magic Shot at Disney California Adventure - cardholders have access to a private photo opportunity at Disney California Adventure, where a Disney character will be digitally added to your photo.

The showcase will be hosted by The Game Awards executive producer Geoff Keighley and will feature six new game announcements.THQ Nordic didn't reveal exactly all of the games that will be featured during the event, but it did tease the return of a \"legendary franchise. This one is apparently one that \"some for which fans have been waiting decades to get their hands on,\" and there'll also fresh information on open-world RPG ELEX II and new footage on for Expeditions: Rome.One such franchise that could meet the bill at the showcase is TimeSplitters, as work had begun on the series after THQ Nordic purchased publishing labels Koch and Deep Silver in 2018. TimeSsplitters co-director Steve Ellis was hired by the company in 2019, to help \"plot the future course\" for the franchise, THQ Nordic announced during its most recent financial results.Another possible franchise that could get the sequel treatment is Metro, as Metro Exodus was released back in February 2019. Developer 4A Games has kept adding graphical enhancements to its Russian post-apocalyptic first-person shooter since release, and the series has been a consistent best-seller that warrants another sequel.THQ Nordic has had an interesting journey since it was first formed in 2011. Originally called Nordic Games, in 2013 it acquired a huge number of leftover properties from the bankruptcy auctions of the original THQ, grabbing over 150 individual games such as Red Faction, Darksiders, and MX vs. ATV in a $4.9 million deal. By 2016, Nordic Games had rebranded itself to THQ Nordic to build on the legacy and the goodwill of the company that had come before it.September is turning out to be a busy month for video game companies and publishers, as next week will see Sony host its own event to provide more details on its upcoming slate of games.GameSpot may get a commission from retail offers._Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The company will invest $158 million and create 250 jobs in the region. It seems like Gearbox wants to increase its games output in the coming years.Gearbox was acquired by the Embracer Group in April 2021. News of the expansion comes just months after that deal closed. _Borderlands_ and _Duke Nukem_ are some of the more popular franchises in gaming, and it makes sense that Gearbox's new owner would want to capitalize on that. The Embracer Group owns over 70 studios, including major industry players such as Koch Media, Saber Interactive, and THQ Nordic.Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford said the following about why Gearbox was expanding.> The Gearbox Entertainment Company is ambitiously looking both internationally and domestically to grow our creative engine and meet the incredible demand our customers have for talent-crafted experiences with our intellectual property. Following our successful experience establishing Gearbox Studio Quebec, our investment in a new studio in Montreal creates an exciting new prospect for Montreal-based talent.According to a report by Game Developer, Sebastien Caisse and Pierre-Andre Dery will lead the new studio while it works on the _Borderlands_ franchise and also creates new, original games. The two have tremendous amounts of experience in the gaming industry so it seems like Gearbox's Montreal team is in good hands.Report a problem with article### Closer Look: Start menu in Windows 11###  Starfield features Akila, Neon, and New Atlantis as major locationsSend news tip  * Samsung introduces Webcam Monitor S4 for hybrid workers in Front Page News  * PSA: Microsoft is ending support for Silverlight next month in Front Page News  * Court: Epic Games breached contract but Apple must allow external payment methods in Front Page News  * Latest Ubuntu 21.10 blows the wind out of Windows 10 / 11 in certain performance tests in Front Page News  * Xiaomi launches MicroLED-powered Smart Glasses in Front Page News  * While not Jurassic Park, woolly mammoths could certainly be walking the Earth real soon in Front Page News  * Adobe Acrobat Reader DC 2021.007.20091 in Front Page News  * FastStone Capture 9.7 in Front Page News### While not Jurassic Park, woolly mammoths could certainly be walking the Earth real soon18 hours ago with 19 comments### GeForce Now leak lists God of War, Demon's Souls, and much more for PC20 hours ago with 9 comments### Mozilla bypasses Microsoft, makes it easier to set Firefox as default browser in WindowsSep 13, 2021 with 50 comments### Closer Look: Power and battery settings in Windows 11Sep 12, 2021 with 6 comments### Saints Row is getting a reboot, launches in February 2022Aug 25, 2021### Sea of Thieves' Borderlands crossover brings a Vault-themed ship setAug 24, 2021### Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is a fantasy Borderlands spin-off coming in 2022Jun 10, 2021### Telltale's Tales from the Borderlands will return to sale on February 17Feb 10, 2021Sort by oldest first (thread view) Sort by newest first (thread view) Sort by oldest first (linear view) Sort by newest first (linear view)Please enter your reason for reporting this comment.The following codes can be used in comments.back to school###  Windows 11 released to the Beta channel still has broken Taskbar and Start menu###  Microsoft Weekly: New Windows 11 builds, zero-day bugs, and gaming news###  Here is how you can still use (proper) Internet Explorer in Windows 11###  Power & battery settings in Windows 11###  Closer Look: Quick settings and notifications in Windows 11###  Windows 11 for the Dev channel adds minor UI changes and a ton of fixeswindows 11 insider preview###  Civilian astronauts set to go to space in Dragon capsule###  Closer Look: Taskbar in Windows 11(C) Since 2000 Neowin LLC.

The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company. _**_[The  GameDiscoverCo game discovery newsletter is written by 'how people find your game' expert & GameDiscoverCo founder Simon Carless, and is a regular look at how people discover and buy video games in the 2020s.]_Welcome back, newsletter crew, to the sorta-Gamescom week. We think there will be lots more video games announced, adding to\u2026 the large amount of games already announced. (GAME DISCOVERY FIGHT, GO!) We'll try to round it up after the fact.## How do you monitor your game discovery wins?A lot of our recent newsletters have been data-heeeeavy. So we thought it might be good to go 'meta' for this latest one. We've covered 'the road to discovery success' for a large number of games. For example, we talked to the Among Us devs about their success last September!But when it comes to planning and monitoring for discovery success, what tools should you use? As it happens, Steph from Clever Endeavour ( _Ultimate Chicken Horse_ ) just  _\" compiled a whole bunch of the tools I've used and resources that I use for community management\"_ into this handy Notion document \\- and it includes a LOT of useful info on this.There's actually a great 'Learning Resources' page which links to a lot of talks & Twitter threads about community management, social media, and marketing. But we wanted to concentrate on the Tools & Tips area, which includes this section on Analytics Tools for 'listening' ( _\" when others mention your account or certain keywords\"_) and 'owned accounts' ( _\" provide insights into your posts and your account performance\"_).One of the reasons we don't go deep on things like this normally is that we're not strictly marketers. And the readers of this newsletter skew anywhere from single-person indie devs to, uhh, incredibly experienced marketing pros. But we wanted to sketch out the various levels of monitoring we tend to see in companies we work with:  * **Reactive monitoring** : many smaller - or sometimes medium-sized devs - will run Google Analytics on their Steam page, see a traffic spike there or on the Steam back-end in real-time, and then trace it back. (Either by URL, or by looking on platforms that don't give referrer URLs so obviously, like TikTok.)  * **Proactive monitoring** : these teams produce regular reports, often via internal or external marketing partners. These look at top inbound traffic or interest and classifying them into 'owned' or 'earned'. It can be extremely helpful, as long as strategy and behavior changes as a result of the regular reports.And then of course, a combination of the two is great - both real-time and trend-based. To go slightly deeper on this, I also quizzed Astrid Rosemarin, a former Evolve colleague of Steph, who is now Communications Director at New World Interactive (Insurgency: Sandstorm).She noted:  _\" In terms of social listening specifically: it's a mixed bag in terms of what tools cover, and at what level. Each service has different levels of access based on your pricing, and generating data and/or reports are a whole other thing that differentiates many of the tools.\"_As for which tools work with which discovery platforms, Astrid adds: _  \"Almost every tool will pull in a lot of data from Twitter. Facebook and Instagram are fairly restrictive, so level of access depends on what kind of deal the tool has done with the platform. Some are actively working on getting more and better data from Twitch. YouTube has some data, but basically no one touches the comments sections.\"_It occurs to us that a lot of the larger non game-specific 'listening' tools not made by the KGB ( _above_ ) are designed for a very Twitter and Facebook-centric world. But nowadays we think YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, Reddit, and IMGUR are the platforms game devs will get the best uplift from. So that's one reason that Steph references Twitch-specific services like Sullygnome and Twitchtracker, in addition to a host of other omnibus tools.There's also the question of whether you can use one central tool to schedule and post across all 'owned' social media accounts. (Many of these tools, such as Hootsuite, try to provide both posting and monitoring - which in theory could be a delightful solution.)In our experience, a lot of game devs just go and post natively on each platform. This is partly because, as Astrid pointed out to me, things like alt text, polls, and embedded CTAs are difficult to trigger from third party platforms. (And some social media companies actively discourage being able to schedule posts from third party apps!)So these are complex problems. For unpaid posts, we think reactive monitoring ( _' Hey, who just made a TikTok about us and caused that spike?_') is OK for many small and medium sized-devs. But we think you need a strategy layer on top of that ( _' Looking at our stats, we should spend less time on Twitter and more time on IMGUR'_), and it needs to be driven by discovery tactics that are truly working.Then you can layer 'strategizing & monitoring ROI of paid ads' on top of that all, to make a truly towering data cake. And overall, you need a strategic marketing & discovery element in here for free, owned media which isn't just ' _keep pounding those posts_ '. Overall, Steph's list of free/paid analytics tools is a great place to get started. Thanks to both Steph and Astrid for the great info here.## T **he game discovery news round-up..**So let's move on to the game discovery and platform link-a-palooza, shall we? Plenty going on again this week, and happy to highlight it all for your delight and delectation:  * The latest drama in Epic vs. everybody: 'Google's 'Project Hug' paid out huge sums to keep game devs in the [Android] Play Store, Epic filing claims'. This isn't super surprising, and Google's comment acknowledges as much:  _\" We've long had programs in place that support best-in-class developers with enhanced resources and investments to help them reach more customers across Google Play.\"_ Will be interesting to see if it gets further weaponized in the ongoing lawsuits.  * This interview with PlayStation Studios' Hermen Hulst is particularly interesting when he downplays the PC versions of first-party Sony titles:  _\" Typically, there have been about two years between the release on our platform and the PC platform\u2026 But you can rely on us to continue to create platform-defining exclusive content for PlayStation.\" _Still - there's more PC versions of former PlayStation exclusives coming.  * Microlinks: why big publishers are taking NFTs/blockchain seriously after Axie Infinity's smash hit; here's a useful GDD (game design document) template; all the Epic Vs. Apple weird legal filing ephemera that you missed, including Nintendo's anti-Yakuza clauses (which are standard in Japan, btw.)  * Vice's Patrick Klepek did a longer piece on Steam games & Argentina, which includes some comments from me on what devs think about the issue. The piece also gets further into the monetization of Steam trading cards (see: Idle Master), something which is pretty fascinating and I'll try to get deeper into soon.  * Which publishers have released the most current-gen console games? If you look at this graph from Omdia's Steve Bailey, the chart-toppers are Hamster Corp. (448, a selection pictured above!), Ratalaika Games (228), Ubisoft (194), THQ Nordic (187), and onwards through a number of other big publishers. Interesting to see a retro specialist and a porting specialist atop the chart, though.  * In case you missed it, Epic Games Store is opening up its self-publishing closed beta, which  _\" streamline[s] the process for developers to set up their own product pages, achievements, pricing, offers, and upload builds and updates on the Epic Games Store.\"_ We still think being on EGS is worth it, so go apply and check it out!  * Microlinks Pt. 2: this Pyramid Games stock market filing (check the PDF!) has full Steam wishlist & prologue/demo download numbers for their catalog, for the nosy; the SNKRX dev shows his median play time (5 hours, 5 minutes - looks good to me) in comparison to our Shapez.io data; Facebook's really pushing VR (not games, but a good platform builder?) with its Horizon Workrooms showcase.Finally, we've talked about Roblox as a game discovery platform, and we've linked to super-good, 'actually has a conscience' YouTube channel People Make Games before.So it's good to see this story from them contrasting Roblox's $45 billion dollar market valuation (actually it's almost $49 billion right now!) with their payouts to game developers, which we also noted were not exactly, uhh, best in class.

A new report from Bloomberg [paywall] states staff are now belatedly receiving their last pay packet - albeit just a fraction of what they were owed (thanks GamesIndustry.biz).Watch on YouTube38 Studios staff based in Rhode Island allegedly receive just 14 percent of their final earnings. Those based in Maryland get 20 percent.Another added wrinkle? Employees are being contacted about the money via their addresses at the time - many of which are now outdated, as staff have relocated to other jobs since.Kingdoms of Amalur was famously pitched as the entry point into a new fantasy world - one created by author R.A. Salvatore, Todd McFarlane and Oblivion lead designer Ken Rolston. There were plans for a World of Warcraft-scale MMO, to which Reckoning (and a proposed sequel) would simply be the prologue.At launch, Amalur sold moderately well but not enough to pay back an investment from the state of Rhode Island - and developer 38 Studios was soon shut down. The studio's founder, former baseball player Curt Schilling, was engulfed in years of messy legal wrangling over funds. Memorably, Schilling auctioned off an infamous, bloodied baseball sock to raise some cash.Four years later, Schilling was cleared of criminal charges over the investment money. Finally, THQ Nordic scooped up the rights to the Amalur franchise and released a remaster of the game in 2020. A new expansion, Fatesworn, is due later this year._Sometimes we include links to online retail stores.

Released in 2012, the game was moderately successful. Unfortunately the studio behind it was not. Due to mismanagement and chronic overspending, 38 Studios abruptly closed its doors in 2012 leaving behind a $75 million bill and many employees who were owed wages. According to Bloomberg, those employees are now receiving that final paycheck nine years after the developer closed\u2026 or at least part of it.Following nine years of legal arguments, the latest bankruptcy documents show it has been decided each employee of the company will receive a minimum of 14% of what they were owed while others will get a maximum of 20%. Those paychecks finally started arriving this week, although many have ended up in the wrong hands seeing as their intended recipients have since moved several times for other jobs within the industry.38 Studios was the creation of baseball player Curt Schilling, who formed the studio with the idea of creating an MMORPG to rival _World of Warcraft_. In 2011, he agreed a $75 million deal with Rhode Island to relocate the studio from Massachusetts and create 450 jobs. With interest, the loan totalled $112.6 million and this had to be repaid by 2020. Their first and only game was _Kingdoms of Amalur_ , which sold 1.2 million copies within its first 90 days. The problem was it needed to shift 3 million copies to break even and it didn\u2019t reach that total quickly enough. This left the studio struggling to repay the loan.The first cheque bounced and while the studio did manage to make the first loan repayment, it was late. Despite this, the studio felt confident enough to release a new trailer for an MMO set in the world of Amalur, _Project Copernicus_. Just days later, the studio laid off all 379 of their staff and closed its doors. None of them had received their last paychecks, due a couple of weeks beforehand. It also left Rhode Island taxpayers with the bill, resulting in allegations of fraud and criminal activity against the studio. No criminal charges were ever brought.The _Kingdoms of Amalur_ IP later found itself in the hands of THQ Nordic, who remastered the game for PS4 complete with a brand new DLC expansion. While _Project Copernicus_ will never see the light of day, there\u2019s a chance the game will eventually get a sequel although that would surely be a bitter pill to swallow for the game\u2019s original developers at 38 Studios.Tags: 38 Studios, Big Huge Games, Kingdoms of Amalur, Kingdoms of Amalur: ReckoningShare this article on facebookSHAREShare this article on twitterTWEETEvolve Media LLCPlayStationLifeStyle is a property of Evolve Media Holdings, LLC.

The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company. _**_[The  GameDiscoverCo game discovery newsletter is written by 'how people find your game' expert & GameDiscoverCo founder Simon Carless, and is a regular look at how people discover and buy video games in the 2020s.]_Welcome back, newsletter crew, to the sorta-Gamescom week. We think there will be lots more video games announced, adding to\u2026 the large amount of games already announced. (GAME DISCOVERY FIGHT, GO!) We'll try to round it up after the fact.## How do you monitor your game discovery wins?A lot of our recent newsletters have been data-heeeeavy. So we thought it might be good to go 'meta' for this latest one. We've covered 'the road to discovery success' for a large number of games. For example, we talked to the Among Us devs about their success last September!But when it comes to planning and monitoring for discovery success, what tools should you use? As it happens, Steph from Clever Endeavour ( _Ultimate Chicken Horse_ ) just  _\" compiled a whole bunch of the tools I've used and resources that I use for community management\"_ into this handy Notion document \\- and it includes a LOT of useful info on this.There's actually a great 'Learning Resources' page which links to a lot of talks & Twitter threads about community management, social media, and marketing. But we wanted to concentrate on the Tools & Tips area, which includes this section on Analytics Tools for 'listening' ( _\" when others mention your account or certain keywords\"_) and 'owned accounts' ( _\" provide insights into your posts and your account performance\"_).One of the reasons we don't go deep on things like this normally is that we're not strictly marketers. And the readers of this newsletter skew anywhere from single-person indie devs to, uhh, incredibly experienced marketing pros. But we wanted to sketch out the various levels of monitoring we tend to see in companies we work with:  * **Reactive monitoring** : many smaller - or sometimes medium-sized devs - will run Google Analytics on their Steam page, see a traffic spike there or on the Steam back-end in real-time, and then trace it back. (Either by URL, or by looking on platforms that don't give referrer URLs so obviously, like TikTok.)  * **Proactive monitoring** : these teams produce regular reports, often via internal or external marketing partners. These look at top inbound traffic or interest and classifying them into 'owned' or 'earned'. It can be extremely helpful, as long as strategy and behavior changes as a result of the regular reports.And then of course, a combination of the two is great - both real-time and trend-based. To go slightly deeper on this, I also quizzed Astrid Rosemarin, a former Evolve colleague of Steph, who is now Communications Director at New World Interactive (Insurgency: Sandstorm).She noted:  _\" In terms of social listening specifically: it's a mixed bag in terms of what tools cover, and at what level. Each service has different levels of access based on your pricing, and generating data and/or reports are a whole other thing that differentiates many of the tools.\"_As for which tools work with which discovery platforms, Astrid adds: _  \"Almost every tool will pull in a lot of data from Twitter. Facebook and Instagram are fairly restrictive, so level of access depends on what kind of deal the tool has done with the platform. Some are actively working on getting more and better data from Twitch. YouTube has some data, but basically no one touches the comments sections.\"_It occurs to us that a lot of the larger non game-specific 'listening' tools not made by the KGB ( _above_ ) are designed for a very Twitter and Facebook-centric world. But nowadays we think YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, Reddit, and IMGUR are the platforms game devs will get the best uplift from. So that's one reason that Steph references Twitch-specific services like Sullygnome and Twitchtracker, in addition to a host of other omnibus tools.There's also the question of whether you can use one central tool to schedule and post across all 'owned' social media accounts. (Many of these tools, such as Hootsuite, try to provide both posting and monitoring - which in theory could be a delightful solution.)In our experience, a lot of game devs just go and post natively on each platform. This is partly because, as Astrid pointed out to me, things like alt text, polls, and embedded CTAs are difficult to trigger from third party platforms. (And some social media companies actively discourage being able to schedule posts from third party apps!)So these are complex problems. For unpaid posts, we think reactive monitoring ( _' Hey, who just made a TikTok about us and caused that spike?_') is OK for many small and medium sized-devs. But we think you need a strategy layer on top of that ( _' Looking at our stats, we should spend less time on Twitter and more time on IMGUR'_), and it needs to be driven by discovery tactics that are truly working.Then you can layer 'strategizing & monitoring ROI of paid ads' on top of that all, to make a truly towering data cake. And overall, you need a strategic marketing & discovery element in here for free, owned media which isn't just ' _keep pounding those posts_ '. Overall, Steph's list of free/paid analytics tools is a great place to get started. Thanks to both Steph and Astrid for the great info here.## T **he game discovery news round-up..**So let's move on to the game discovery and platform link-a-palooza, shall we? Plenty going on again this week, and happy to highlight it all for your delight and delectation:  * The latest drama in Epic vs. everybody: 'Google's 'Project Hug' paid out huge sums to keep game devs in the [Android] Play Store, Epic filing claims'. This isn't super surprising, and Google's comment acknowledges as much:  _\" We've long had programs in place that support best-in-class developers with enhanced resources and investments to help them reach more customers across Google Play.\"_ Will be interesting to see if it gets further weaponized in the ongoing lawsuits.  * This interview with PlayStation Studios' Hermen Hulst is particularly interesting when he downplays the PC versions of first-party Sony titles:  _\" Typically, there have been about two years between the release on our platform and the PC platform\u2026 But you can rely on us to continue to create platform-defining exclusive content for PlayStation.\" _Still - there's more PC versions of former PlayStation exclusives coming.  * Microlinks: why big publishers are taking NFTs/blockchain seriously after Axie Infinity's smash hit; here's a useful GDD (game design document) template; all the Epic Vs. Apple weird legal filing ephemera that you missed, including Nintendo's anti-Yakuza clauses (which are standard in Japan, btw.)  * Vice's Patrick Klepek did a longer piece on Steam games & Argentina, which includes some comments from me on what devs think about the issue. The piece also gets further into the monetization of Steam trading cards (see: Idle Master), something which is pretty fascinating and I'll try to get deeper into soon.  * Which publishers have released the most current-gen console games? If you look at this graph from Omdia's Steve Bailey, the chart-toppers are Hamster Corp. (448, a selection pictured above!), Ratalaika Games (228), Ubisoft (194), THQ Nordic (187), and onwards through a number of other big publishers. Interesting to see a retro specialist and a porting specialist atop the chart, though.  * In case you missed it, Epic Games Store is opening up its self-publishing closed beta, which  _\" streamline[s] the process for developers to set up their own product pages, achievements, pricing, offers, and upload builds and updates on the Epic Games Store.\"_ We still think being on EGS is worth it, so go apply and check it out!  * Microlinks Pt. 2: this Pyramid Games stock market filing (check the PDF!) has full Steam wishlist & prologue/demo download numbers for their catalog, for the nosy; the SNKRX dev shows his median play time (5 hours, 5 minutes - looks good to me) in comparison to our Shapez.io data; Facebook's really pushing VR (not games, but a good platform builder?) with its Horizon Workrooms showcase.Finally, we've talked about Roblox as a game discovery platform, and we've linked to super-good, 'actually has a conscience' YouTube channel People Make Games before.So it's good to see this story from them contrasting Roblox's $45 billion dollar market valuation (actually it's almost $49 billion right now!) with their payouts to game developers, which we also noted were not exactly, uhh, best in class.

The bulk of this -- SEK 2.96 billion ($339 million) -- comes from its Games business, up 83% year-on-year.THQ Nordic was the largest segment and showed the most growth, up 37% year-on-year to SEK 668.7 ($76.5 million).This was largely attributed to the launch of Biomutant, which has sold more than one million copies since launching at the end of May.Embracer added that the game recouped all costs -- including development, marketing and even the acquisition of creator Experiment 101 and the IP \\-- within a week of launch.Koch Media remains the second biggest segment at SEK 637.6 million ($72.9 million), up 4% from last year.Saber Interactive was the only division to show decline, with net sales down 13% from SEK 349.2 million ($39.9 million) to SEK 304.9 million ($34.9 million). This was attributed to a lack of new releases, compared to last year's successful launch of Snowrunner.Two significant acquisitions earlier this year also bolstered Embracer's financial results. The addition of Easybrain contributed net sales of SEK 576 million ($65.9 million), while Gearbox Entertainment brought with it net sales of SEK 437 million ($50 million).Sales of Embracer's partner publishing and film business were up 4% year-on-year to SEK 465.7 million ($53.4 million).The group's EBITDA rose by 59% to SEK 1.5 billion ($171.5 million), while operational EBIT was up 79% to SEK 1.3 billion ($148.7 million).In his comments, CEO Lars Wingefors said both sales and operational EBIT had set new company records, in line with management expectations.He also said the number of games in development across the group had risen to 180, although it's worth nothing this includes titles that will be published by other companies, such as Borderlands spin-off Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, which will be published by 2K.Wingefors noted that the next quarter will likely rely heavily on back catalogue titles, but a \"strong pipeline of new releases\" for the third and fourth quarters will drive growth for the full financial year.This pipeline does not appear to be fully public as of yet, with game announced planned for up to December, and Wingefors predicting a \"busier than previously forecasted\" fourth quarter (January to March 2022).Towards the end of his comments, Wingefors alluded to the current controversy around firms such as Activision Blizzard and Ubisoft, which have been faced with allegations of discrimination and harassment.\"As recent times have shown, there are also other challenges in society and in our industry. It is important that we, as an industry, but also as individual companies and as a parent company, each take our responsibility to change these social structures of discrimination,\" he wrote.\"For Embracer Group our common foundation is our code of compliance, which aims to support inclusion, diversity, and gender equality. Furthermore, we trust that each company in our Group listen, discuss and act. A way to measure and follow up our employees is done via a global survey that allows each employee to answer several questions anonymously.\"As has become almost customary, Embracer announced more acquisitions alongside its financial results, with Demiurge Studios, Fractured Byte and SmartPhone Labs being added to Saber Interactive.Earlier this month, the company revealed it had acquired eight more studios, including mobile games firm CrazyLabs and Road 96 developer DigixArt.Embracer Group's headcount now stands at 7,886 -- almost double what it was this time last year.

Anyone who worked in the Rhode Island studio will receive 14% of what they were owed when the studio shut down in 2012, while those who worked at the Maryland office will receive 20%.38 Studios was founded in 2006 by former Major League Baseball player Curt Schilling, and produced just one title: action-RPG Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning.However, a combination of the game's disappointing sales and the company's mismanaged finance led the studio to shut down in 2012. Shortly after, it filed for bankruptcy, reporting debts of $150.7 million to over 1,000 creditors.At the time, there were reports of missed paychecks for employees and turmoil caused by the company's relocation from Boston, Massachusetts to Providence, Rhode Island. At one point, 38 Studios was focused on paying a $75 million loan related to the move rather than paying its staff.Kingdoms of Amalur has resurfaced in recent years, as THQ Nordic purchased the IP rights and the related but unfinished MMORPG Project Copernicus.The remastered Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning was released last year.Making the games industry a better place to workFind out more__Sign up for The Daily Update and get the best of GamesIndustry.biz in your inbox.Enter your email address## Ex-38 Studios execs to settle suit for $2.5 millionCurt Schilling, three others admit no wrongdoing in proposed end to Rhode Island lawsuit; money would come from insuranceBy Brendan Sinclair __4 years ago## No criminal charges in 38 Studios collapseRhode Island says \"no provable criminal violations\" in Kingdoms of Amalur company's downfall, but civil litigation still outstandingBy Brendan Sinclair __5 years agoUK PR Executive (Entry Level)Senior UI/UX Designer \u2013 Mobile Games \u2013 Fully remoteJunior / Experienced Programmer __Second Impact GamesDiscover more jobs in games __There are no comments on this article yet.
